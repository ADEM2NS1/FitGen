DOPING CONTROL
All athletes should check the status of all medications they plan to take PRIOR to taking them.
This includes over-the-counter and prescription medications. It is the responsibility of the athlete to
ensure that no prohibited substance enters his/her system.
The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) offers a Drug Reference Line (719-785-2000)
and a Drug Reference Online (www.globaldro.com) where athletes, coaches, parents and medical
professionals may check to ensure that proper documentation is on file for their medications and
that they are consuming medications that are permitted.
Dietary supplements are considered “Take at Your Own Risk” as claims made by the
manufacturers/distributors of dietary supplements regarding the effectiveness or contents of their
products are not strictly regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Any commercial
dietary supplement is susceptible to containing substances that may appear on the Prohibited
Substance list(s) of FINA and/or the World Anti-Doping Agency. These substances may not be
listed on the ingredients label of the product. Athletes should visit USADA's Supplement 411
website for detailed information regarding the supplement industry (including a high-risk list):
http://www.usada.org/substances/supplement-411/
Athletes are also strongly encouraged to check every ingredient of every product they plan to
consume as prohibited substances may be listed as ingredients.
To comply with the 2015 World Anti-Doping Code, FINA, USOC and USADA have all amended
their anti-doping rules. The rules are available at the offices of USA Swimming or may be found
online at the following websites:
WADA www.wada-ama.org
FINA www.fina.org
USOC www.usoc.org
USADA www.usada.org
The 2019 List of Prohibited Substances and Methods is available on the websites listed above.
This List will take effect on January 1, 2019.
U.S. CENTER FOR SAFESPORT
The U.S. Center for SafeSport helpline and resources may be found online at www.safesport.org.
