Introduction
INTRODUCTION
As swimmers, we appreciate what an amazing thing the human body is. After
all, we use our bodies from head to toe to perform our sport. The complex
system of muscles that weaves together over our frames allows us to do the
quick, explosive movements, and the long, repetitious movements that
make up swimming. Our muscles work in tandem to make it possible to
perform tasks as simple as putting on goggles and as lofty as winning
Olympic gold.
Yet, when we see a fantastic swimmer moving through the water with grace
and speed, we don’t associate their speed with muscular strength. Instead
we associate it with skill. We notice their skill at reducing drag and
maintaining a streamlined body shape. We notice their skill at “feeling” the
water and using it to their advantage. We notice their skill at coordinating
stroke actions that together produce fluid forward motion.
In fact, it is widely accepted that swimming is not a matter of muscling your
way through the water. Swimmers have to know how to swim!
Still, it is puzzling to see swimmers with such picture-perfect strokes that they
could star in a video on stroke technique who, when the time comes to swim
fast, are unable to generate speed. Then there are swimmers with equally
developed stroke technique who move through the water with such velocity
that they appear to be wearing invisible flippers. So, what is the difference?
What makes one swimmer able to achieve speed in the water but another
swimmer unable to?
The main difference is strength. The mechanics of swimming are not based
on technique alone but also on the application of force and power. When
we swim, our muscles are engaged in an integrated sequence of actions to
both exert resistance on the water and to balance and stabilize our bodies
so that forward motion is realized. In this way, when two swimmers, both
with solid stroke technique, are swimming side by side, the stronger
swimmer will be faster. Thus, that fantastic swimmer, who looks like poetry
in motion, is in actuality muscling his way through the water! By adding
strength to skill, faster swimming is possible.
As the title of this book suggests, strength training for swimming is a very
specialized activity. The specific audience and the specific goal of this book
7

--- Page 10 Text ---
Strength Training for Faster Swimming
lead us to the logical conclusion that swimming strength is not developed
very well through a general approach to strength training. Building useable
strength for swimming requires attention to more than making the muscles
strong. It requires orientation toward specific aspects of strength. It requires
simulation of swimming directionality and tempo. Above all, it requires
attention to training multi-muscle movements, like those that make up
swimming. General strength training may produce some positive results in a
hit or miss fashion, but it can also produce bulk and fatigue that can
interfere with swimming. To make sure that strength work produces the
intended results for swimmers, it must be designed and structured with
swimming in mind.
To illustrate this point, I would like to share a story that a swimmer
recounted with me about the last year of his long swimming career. He told
me that he had been a dedicated swimmer, with twelve years of training and
competition experience under his belt. He had enviable technique, and even
more enviable endurance. Knocking off 10 x 200 on the 2:30, and swimming
double workouts five days a week, was no problem. He was, in fact, a
coaches’ ideal of self-motivation, and a role model of good work ethic to
the rest of his team. He did it all because he dreamed of going to the
Olympics. It was more than a dream though; it was a goal, and at the age
of 18, he was determined to make the Olympic team.
After months of intense training, he found himself at a plateau and decided to
supplement his swimming with weights. In addition to swimming over 80,000
each week, he also went to the gym and lifted weights, understanding that
more strength would benefit his swimming speed. He developed a routine of
exercises from those he observed other people at the gym doing regularly,
including all the standard body building lifts. He did bench press, military press
and French curls by the dozens. He got to the point that he could lift impressive
amounts of weight with little effort. He continued this routine diligently for
several months, building a large and well-defined upper body. As the last meet
of the season approached, he found himself feeling quite tired, and his test
swims were not outstanding, showing a sluggish tempo and higher stroke
count than desirable. Still, going into the competition, he maintained his
confidence. He believed that because he had worked as hard as he could both
in and out of the water, he would make a swimming breakthrough. But after
his race, he was stunned to have made no progress at all. In fact, he had
clocked a time that he achieved two years before. Disappointed that all of his
dedication and training had made no impact, he became disheartened and
soon lost interest in swimming, allowing his dream to slip away.

Introduction
This sad story is all too common. A swimmer with amazing work ethic and
goal-oriented drive gets into a cycle of extreme over-training and non-
specific, non-progressive strength training. Despite red flags – including
plateau, fatigue, and reduced flexibility – that foretell poor race results, the
swimmer keeps training and fails to reach the goal.
Coaches and swimmers: This is preventable!
This book addresses strength training as a means to achieve more speed in
the water, rather than simply a means to become stronger. Emphasis is placed
on both the underlying concepts and crucial details of building strength that
transfers to swimming. Readers will explore how to structure a strength
training program that will work with the swimming routine. Readers will learn
about the importance of individualizing training to match a swimmer’s stage
of development, level of experience, and swimming specialty. Readers will
discover what kinds of activities build usable strength in the water.
At the end of the book, a series of strength training routines and circuits are
included for each stage of development. Before skipping right to that chapter,
please take time to read the rest of the book first so you will have the
background information that will prepare you to get the best results possible.
Here is to reaching your swimming dreams!

What Makes Swimmers Fast?
1 WHAT MAKES
SWIMMERS FAST?
The common goal in competitive swimming is to swim faster and, to a large
extent, training is the means to that objective. The evolution of our sport has
been marked by countless theories of training, based on emerging science,
past results and intuition. Determined swimmers pair with inspired coaches in
search of the perfect formula for attaining swimming speed. Training methods
using more volume, or less volume but more intensity both in and out of the
water, diets with more protein or less protein, and various pre-competition
rituals have been designed with the single purpose of defying speed barriers.
And swimming times keep dropping, as many of these strategies have resulted
in incredible success for individual swimmers. But the fact is no single training
formula has worked across the board. Some swimmers do better swimming
twice a day, while others only once. Some swimmers will benefit from weight
training, while others will get more out of a self-resistance program. Some
swimmers can eat anything, anytime, but some have to carefully watch their
calorie intake. Some swimmers race better practicing all the way up to the day
before the meet, but others need several days, or even weeks of rest.
We have come to understand that a uniform training strategy for competitive
swimming is both ineffective and unrealistic. Differences in stage of
development, conditioning and skill level, body type, rate of recovery, and
swimming specialty reveal that an individualized approach to training yields
the best results.
While there is no single alchemy, certain training principles have endured and
gained acceptance as integral elements in the quest for swimming speed.
11

Strength Training for Faster Swimming
SWIMMING
The main element in a swimmer’s training, at every stage of his or her career,
must be swimming. Without frequent and ample time in the water, even the
best athlete will not be prepared to swim fast because he will not be
prepared to swim well. Only time in the water enables a swimmer to develop
the swimming technique that leads to the essential ability to “feel” the
water. Only time in the water teaches a swimmer to eliminate drag and be
more “fishlike.” Only time in the water gives a swimmer the experience of
coordinating stroke actions and accessing the best sequence of muscles to
accomplish fluid forward motion. Only time in the water enables a swimmer
to practice stroke economy, balance and stability in the aquatic environment.
There is no substitute for time in the water. To be a faster swimmer, one first
has to be a good swimmer.
ATHLETIC BASE
The saying goes, “better athletes make better swimmers.” There is no way
around it. Swimming is not a sport that gives immediate gratification. When
a person comes into competitive swimming without a base of athleticism, a
great deal of time and energy must be devoted to building that base, to
prepare the person to take on the rigors of training for competitive
swimming. In contrast, when these qualities are already present, a swimmer
is able to excel faster. A swimmer who comes into swimming with an athletic
base in place is able to concentrate on developing solid swimming skills,
gaining swimming experience, and swimming fast!
12

What Makes Swimmers Fast?
Athleticism is defined in many ways. For the purposes of this book, we will
measure athleticism in the following terms:
1) Cardiovascular fitness — ability of the body to transport and utilize
oxygen
2) Flexibility — range of motion
3) Coordination — integrating movements into unified effective effort
4) Strength — power, force, explosiveness and stability against resistance
An active lifestyle beginning in childhood that includes casual and organized
activities that involve running, jumping, climbing and balancing builds
overall athletic ability.
STRENGTH TRAINING
When analyzing the qualities of athleticism that are most developed by
swimmers, we see that, without a doubt, competitive swimming provides
some of the best cardiovascular fitness of any sport. The full body
requirements and repetitive nature of our sport promotes high levels of
aerobic capacity and cardiovascular efficiency, much like runners and cyclists
possess, but with the added requirement of propelling ourselves through a
medium thicker than air. Swimming also requires mastery of breathing timing
(more so than any other sport). Whereas on land, athletes have no
restrictions on breathing, in swimming getting new air is limited to the time
when the face is out of the water, ultimately boosting fitness even further.
13
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 13 12.07.11 12:11

--- Page 16 Text ---
Strength Training for Faster Swimming
Swimmers are also very flexible, and in many cases, almost too flexible. The
loose joints (especially in the shoulders) that enable a swimmer to reach
and stroke effectively, and move so fluidly can also allow the bones to move
around at the joint, causing inflammation and pain. The only area where
swimmers often lack enough flexibility is at the ankle, where it is desirable
to have the ability to easily point the toes and create a straight line to the
knee. Still, among land athletes, only ballet dancers have better ankle
flexibility than swimmers.
Swimmers are very coordinated, as well. The complex nature of swimming
uses every part of the body to move forward in a series of movements within
each stroke cycle, encouraging an intuitive understanding of the kinetic chain.
And, in what other sport does the athlete propel himself or herself at full
speed toward a wall, then tuck and reverse directions without slowing down?
Finally, we come to strength, the final measure of athletic condition. As we
compare the strength developed by swimmers with the strength developed
by other athletes, it is clear that swimmers do not develop the same degree
of musculature as many other athletes. For example, football players and
weightlifters develop more muscle bulk than swimmers in order to succeed
in their sports. But since swimming does not have the same strength
requirements as football and weightlifting, should we be concerned with
strength levels in swimming? The answer is yes! While swimmers do not
need muscle size to excel, they do need muscle strength.
There are four types of strength that swimmers should be concerned with:
14
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 14 12.07.11 12:11

--- Page 17 Text ---
What Makes Swimmers Fast?
FORCE
Force is the maximum amount of resistance that can be applied. In the case
of swimming, force refers to the maximum resistance that can be applied to
the water, in one stroke, from the beginning of the catch through the end
of the underwater stroke, accelerating from beginning to end. More
deliverable force improves a swimmer’s distance per stroke, ultimately
producing more potential for speed.
POWER
Power is the ability to maintain force over time. In swimming, power is
required to do the series of strokes it takes to complete any single lap or
distance in the pool. A swimmer who is able to keep a higher percentage of
force throughout his or her race all the way to the end with less fatigue is
able to maintain more even splits, and therefore produce a faster overall time.
EXPLOSIVENESS
Explosiveness is the ability to recruit a burst of force. In swimming,
explosiveness is beneficial for fast starts, turns and sprinting. A swimmer
with good explosive strength is quick off the blocks and has turns that set
him or her apart from the field. Explosiveness is also the basis of sprinting.
However, it should be pointed out that swimming even the shortest race,
with its 20 to 30-second average time span, takes more than just
explosiveness, it also takes power and force to sprint well.
STABILITY
Stability refers to one’s ability to balance and control movements from
within the body. In swimming, we must be able to create and maintain
integrity in motion, and do so without the support of the ground. The ability
to stabilize oneself is crucial to producing forward motion while floating. A
swimmer with good stability is able to generate power from the center of
the body and send it upward to the arms and downward to the legs in a
continual chain reaction to generate speed.
A carefully designed strength training program enhances a swimmer’s water
training, dramatically enriching its value. In addition to swimming, strength
training that addresses all four kinds of strength should be considered an
essential part of a swimmer’s long-term training.

Strength Training for Faster Swimming
HOW LAND-BASED STRENGTH
TRAINING ENCOURAGES
SWIMMING SPEED
Resistance is the basis of all strength
building. Although there are some effective
ways of increasing resistance during
swimming, including hand paddles,
tethered swimming, drag suits and towing
chutes and pails, the reality is that none
of these methods can deliver the results
in terms of building strength that can be
achieved on land.
With more gravitational effect on land
than in the water, more load is possible.
Strategic strength training that develops
the force required to resist a load on land
builds the swimmer’s ability to apply more force to the underwater stroke,
both in the catch and the acceleration of the arm toward the finish, thus
moving his or her body farther and faster per stroke with less fatigue. In
addition to this, self-stabilization, especially in the horizontal swimming
position, is much more challenging out of the water. By learning to maintain
body position against gravity on land, a swimmer will develop a stronger
foundation to swim from.
With less resistance in the air than in the water, the tempo of movements
can be quicker on land. Strategic strength training that develops the power
to repeatedly move a load through the air gives the swimmer more strength
to overcome the thickness of the water. It also brings an increased and
sustainable tempo to his or her swimming stroke. In addition, practicing true
explosive actions on land gives a swimmer quicker reaction time to his or
her starts, more speed off the walls in turns, and a solid base for sprinting.
By making use of gravity to increase load, and by making use of the “thin”
environment of the air to increase rate, strength is developed better and faster
on land than it would be in the water. Strength training on land increases
force potential, improves core stability, builds deliverable power, and develops
explosiveness, all of which positively encourage more speed and decrease
fatigue in the water. A swimmer who uses the ideal environment to build
strength brings an advantage back to the ideal environment for swimming.

What Makes Swimmers Fast?
WHY SWIMMING IS NOT ENOUGH
In the aquatic environment, resistance and gravity provide both challenges
and advantages. These challenges make strength the most difficult athletic
quality to develop through water training alone. The advantages make
strength the least noticeable athletic quality in swimmers. Swimmers, in fact,
are often are so developed in terms of fitness, flexibility and coordination
that strength is overlooked.
Swimmers spend a great deal of time learning the essential skill of
overcoming the resistance of the water. We search for the best body position
so we will slide through the water without interrupting it, avoiding drag that
will slow us down, much like an airplane that is designed to cut through the
air with the least resistance. But in addition to learning to treat the water
like air, we must also learn to treat it like rock. We must learn to use the
resistance of the water to our advantage. We must be able to grab hold of
it, like it was solid, anchoring our hand at a point in front of us, then move
our body past that point, similar to a rock climber who grasps the rock at
a point above, then lifts his or her body beyond that point.
Applying resistance to the water takes strength, and just like a more
streamlined swimmer has an advantage, a stronger swimmer also has an
advantage. But training in the water limits our ability to develop strength in
two ways. First, the thickness of the water makes the rate of each motion
to advance the body slower than it would on land. Second, in the reduced
gravity environment of the water, the swimmer’s body weight is lighter,
which produces less load for the swimmer to move.
The obvious question that arises is: if our medium is water, why should we
be concerned with moving at the rate we could on land, or being able to
move a larger load than we need to in the water? The answer is, that when
we are able to recruit more force, power, explosiveness and stability, in
combination with using good swimming skills, we are able to achieve more
speed in the water. Land-based strength training builds useable strength for
swimmers. A training routine that combines swimming and strength work on
land gives swimmers an edge over water-based training alone.

Strength Training for Faster Swimming
MORE BENEFITS OF STRENGTH TRAINING
While the primary objective for swimmers engaged in land-based strength
training is to build more speed in the water, there are additional benefits
as well.
INJURY PREVENTION
Strength training is one of the most proactive steps a swimmer can take to
prevent injuries, especially to the shoulders. The recognizable physique of
a swimmer features large shoulders and a well-developed upper body, but
is often punctuated by poor posture. The shortened chest muscles and
lengthened back muscles developed by swimmers can result in posture
imbalance, often accompanied by shoulders that drop forward, and are
sometimes internally rotated. Long-term swimming with this posture can
lead to inflammation around the shoulders and pain when the bones are
not held firmly in place on all sides. Eventually, if not corrected, such an
imbalance can lead to injury that can take a swimmer out of action.
Strength training can correct imbalances by targeting the stabilizing muscles
around the shoulder joints. Posture can also be improved by targeting the
muscles of the upper back. Balanced strength and better posture help a
swimmer remain injury free.

What Makes Swimmers Fast?
TRAINING TIME MANAGEMENT
Another benefit of strength training is the management of training time.
Limitations on water time, as well as limits on the productive swimming a
person can be expected to do in one session can lead to training content
deficiencies. As we try to include every training element into our limited water
time, we may end up short on every element. By supplementing water training
with additional time dedicated to land-based strength work, more value can
be achieved in with the overall training routine. Precious water time can be
used to practice solid technique, including stroke coordination, the elimination
of drag, refining “feel” for the water, and to experience swimming economically
at any speed. Land work can be used to develop the full spectrum of
swimming-specific strength, where it is developed most efficiently.
NEW FEEDBACK
Strength training also adds a new dimension of feedback to a swimmer’s
routine. It is common for swimmers to become so accustomed to swimming
that they forget to pay attention to the mechanics of what they are doing in
the water. Land-based strength training provides a new way to “connect”
with the physical actions of the sport. In addition, swimmers can observe
improvement in strength as they adapt to the workload. More repetitions,
more resistance, and faster tempo achieved over time on land give a
swimmer concrete feedback that they are improving, thereby building
confidence and motivation.

2 MAKING STRENGTH
TRAINING COUNT
The ultimate effectiveness of a strength training program is measured in
terms of what is accomplished in the pool. There must be positive results.
To make sure this happens, the strength training program should be designed
and redesigned to meet that objective. It should evolve as the swimmer’s
strength evolves and consider the individual swimmer’s changing needs. This
means that careful observation and monitoring must be an essential element
of the program. By evaluating results, or lack of results, we can tailor the
program to work better or take positive steps to redirect efforts. Ongoing
evaluation should consider a number of issues, as outlined below.
TRANSFERABILITY
The key to a successful strength
training program is that every
activity must be transferable to
swimming speed. If it doesn’t
transfer, then it is a waste of
time, or worse, it could even
hinder faster swimming. Every
strength training exercise can
make a swimmer tired, but once
the swimmer recovers, does the
new strength improve his or her
swimming speed?
In order to get strength work to
transfer to swimming speed, it
is important to perform activities
that use swimming-like movement and target major swimming-specific
muscle groups that together produce that movement, including both visible
and underlying muscles. We must strengthen the muscles that move us
forward as well as those that stabilize us. It is important to consider
directionality when applying resistance on land. Our primary effort should
be focused in simulating the direction of swimming. It is also important to
mimic swimming tempo as much as possible. A tempo slower than swimming
tempo will not transfer to faster speed in the water.
21
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 21 12.07.11 12:11

--- Page 24 Text ---
Strength Training for Faster Swimming
Finally, at the stage of a swimmer’s career when he is specializing in
particular events, it is important to focus on strength work that will benefit
the swimmer’s specialty. Strength work for these specialists should maximize
the strong aspects of the swimmer’s event and build up the weak points.
For instance, if a swimmer is specializing in the 200 fly and has awesome
stroke efficiency, but tends to lose tempo on the last 50, the emphasis of
strength work should be on training for force (the strong point) as well as
building power (the weak point). However, a 50 freestyle specialist who is
an awesome finisher but needs to improve reaction time off the blocks,
should focus on training for power (the strong point) as well as building
explosiveness (the weak point).
ADAPTATION
Strength training is based on
the premise that when muscles
are stressed, they adapt to that
stress, thus becoming stronger.
Because the process of stressing
muscles actually creates tiny
tears in the muscle fibers, they
must be allowed to rest and
rebuild before they can become
stronger. For this reason,
strength building must be
considered a long-term activity,
designed to build strength
gradually over time, using
periods of stress and rest.
When adaptation is allowed to
occur in this way, it is important
that the program evolve,
providing new challenges to swimmers as they adapt. Such challenges can
take the form of doing the same exercise with more load, more repetitions,
or faster repetitions depending on the objective. Or a swimmer could be
asked to perform a more complex action than before. Simply repeating the
same stress that the swimmer has already adapted to will not increase
strength. Each time a swimmer adapts, new demands must be introduced.
By using this kind of progression, a swimmer will develop strength more
steadily through his or her career.
22
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 22 12.07.11 12:11

--- Page 25 Text ---
Making Strength Training Count
There is no hard and fast timeline for adaptation. Just as with swimming,
strength training does not produce immediate results. Patience is required.
A conservative approach, using periodic test sets once a month to gauge
adaptation, should determine when new challenges should be presented.
ORIENTATION
When exposed to resistance, muscle fibers
adapt and develop, resulting in more
strength. The kind of muscle fiber we
develop depends on the amount, duration
and rate of the resistance. Strength training
can develop either slow or fast twitch
muscle fiber. Slow twitch muscle fiber is
associated with endurance and stamina.
Strength training that focuses on developing
power builds slow twitch muscle. Slow
twitch muscle fiber enables us to do
continuous or repetitive movements over a
period of time. Fast twitch muscle fiber is
associated with speed and agility. Strength
training that focuses on developing force
and explosiveness builds fast twitch muscle.
Fast twitch muscle fiber enables us to sprint
and produce bursts of acceleration.
That being said, it is important to remember that in swimming, every event
(no matter how short or how long) benefits from both slow and fast twitch
muscle strength. While fast twitch muscle fiber is most important for sprinting,
even the shortest swimming event requires a number of repetitions of a stroke
to be performed over time. Therefore, some slow twitch fiber is also important
for the sprinter to have a strong finish. Likewise, while slow twitch is most
important for long distance swimming, some fast twitch muscle is essential
for the distance swimmer to develop the force and explosive strength that
would allow him or her to do quicker starts and all those turns.
Swimming is an activity that builds slow twitch muscle very well. However, not
a great deal of fast twitch muscle is built by swimming. This leads some to
conclude that the orientation of a strength training program for swimmers
should focus on slow twitch development because it is the kind of strength
23
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 23 12.07.11 12:11

--- Page 26 Text ---
Strength Training for Faster Swimming
that swimmers use most. But that is only half of the picture. The reason
swimmers engage in land-based strength training is to build more strength
than they can achieve in the water. If the goal of strength training is more
speed then our efforts should address building fast twitch muscle fiber, the
type of muscle fiber associated with speed. The most effective strength training
program, oriented toward the goal of more speed, must actively address fast
twitch muscle development in addition to supplementing the slow twitch work
we already get in the pool and need to swim stroke after stroke.
Every individual naturally possesses either more slow twitch muscle or more
fast twitch muscle that helps determine what activities they will favor. In
swimming, those with more natural slow twitch muscle tend to excel in long
distance events and seem to prefer them, while those with more natural fast
twitch muscle tend to excel in the sprint events and seem to like them more.
Training, however, can change this. While people are born with a
predisposition for endurance or speed, the amount of total muscle fiber
responsible for natural ability is very small. In fact, the majority of muscle
fiber in the human body is neither fast nor slow twitch. It is convertible, or
responsive, to training. Convertible muscle fiber can be trained to work as
fast twitch or slow twitch.
This wealth of convertible muscle fiber suggests some interesting possibilities.
Would a natural sprinter be able to develop more slow twitch muscle fiber
and excel at long distances as well? Would a natural distance swimmer be
able to develop more fast twitch muscle and also excel at the sprint events?
Certainly the presence of convertible muscle fiber offers swimmers the
opportunity to train for more versatility. However, at some point in a
swimmer’s career, success in certain events leads that swimmer to narrow his
or her focus a bit. At that point, training too should be focused toward
particular specialties. Training equally for all distances could reduce the
results at either extreme. Some sprinters can develop a great deal of bulk,
resulting in more resistance and density in the water, in addition to less
flexibility that would hinder long distance performance. Conversely, the stroke
tempo of most distance swimmers is too slow to achieve great sprinting
success. By training for all distances, a swimmer could expect to become
pretty fast across the board, but not very fast at any one event. By
specializing, a swimmer maximizes performance by training convertible
muscle fiber to enhance natural skills.

Making Strength Training Count
VARIATION
The concept of alternating stress and rest suggests that a swimmer should
not do strength training on a daily basis. Actually, for some swimmers, a
well-designed strength training program can be done on sequential days,
although it is advisable to incorporate one to two days off per week for
“pure” rest. The design of a successful daily program accomplishes the stress
and rest model by having the swimmer perform upper body exercises on one
day and lower body exercises the next day. On the upper body work day, the
lower body rests, and on the lower body work day, the upper body rests.
Building in variation in training also keeps a swimmer sharp, both mentally
and physically. A creatively designed program uses a diverse array of exercises
to meet each training objective. For instance, if the objective is explosiveness,
a swimmer could be given leaps for height, 15-yard running sprints, or a speed
jump rope activity. If the objective is core stability, a swimmer could be given
a two-minute plank, a series of “V” ups, or some “left rights” with a medicine
ball. If the objective is power, a swimmer could be given fifteen minutes of
rowing, some stretch cord work, or as many dips as they can do in a minute.
This sort of variation in training adds interest and can boost a swimmer’s
coordination, as he or she is required to accomplish new and different actions
with the same muscles groups. The crucial point is that every exercise that is
added to the mix must bring the swimmer closer to the objective.
25
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 25 12.07.11 12:11

--- Page 28 Text ---
Strength Training for Faster Swimming
Variation also makes things fun. Swimmers spend a lot of time with their
faces in the water, alone with their thoughts, looking at the black line on
the bottom of the pool. A good variety of land-based strength training gives
swimmers the opportunity to socialize while they train, laugh together as
they observe each other’s initially awkward efforts, and motivate each other
as they master the coordination of a new exercise.
OVER-TRAINING
In general, swimmers have a great work ethic. The combination of mental
toughness and a highly developed fitness level enables them to keep
working when they are tired. While, in many ways, this is an admirable trait,
it also leaves swimmers vulnerable to over-training. The danger of over-
training becomes a real concern especially when strength training is added
to a swimmer’s routine. It is important to remember that the main objective
of strength training is to enable a swimmer to produce more speed in the
pool. If strength training is leaving a swimmer continually too tired to swim
well, he or she is probably over-training.
26
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 26 12.07.11 12:11

--- Page 29 Text ---
Making Strength Training Count
Signs of over-training include continual early fatigue in swim practice, slow
tempo, poor race results, plateau, slow adaptation, insomnia, impatience,
prolonged grumpiness and lack of interest.
Over-training should be distinguished from the temporary fatigue associated
with an intense cycle of training that is followed by a planned cycle of rest,
although it may be hard to tell the difference. However, a swimmer who is
temporarily fatigued will respond positively to rest and perform better after
resting. A swimmer who is over-trained will not show much speed improvement
after rest because he has not successfully adapted along the way.
The best way to deal with over-training is to make sure it doesn’t happen.
Careful and ongoing monitoring of progress is required. This is the responsibility
of the coach because often the swimmer will just keep working, focused on
the motto he or she has heard throughout his or her swimming career, “If you
want to be fast, you have to work hard.”
If a swimmer is showing signs of over-training, it should not be ignored.
Reduce training, either in terms of duration, intensity or frequency, both in
and out of the pool. It might be necessary for the swimmer to take a few
days off to recover, then start fresh with a new training plan. If caught early,
a few days off will allow a swimmer to get back on the right track. Long-term
over-training can result in a season of frustration and an associated drop in
confidence and a loss of motivation to continue in the sport.
Coaches must learn to emphasize the fact that rest is good just as strongly
as they emphasize the benefits of hard work. The former is a difficult
concept for many swimmers to accept, but it is an important one. Sometimes,
just working hard does not result in speed; it results in an overly tired
swimmer. There is a very fine line between working very hard and working
too hard, and every swimmer’s threshold is slightly different. Finding each
swimmer’s balance point is a crucial part of designing a training program
that results in faster swimming.

Strength Training for Faster Swimming
SEASON PLANNING
The goal of strength training is to progressively produce more swimming
speed over a swimmer’s career, by season, and from meet to meet. Because
the ultimate test of the effectiveness of a strength training program is race
performance, we must plan our program with competition dates in mind. To
ensure that a swimmer is ready to race well, the training plan must
accommodate some degree of rest before race day. However, with swim
meets scheduled an average of once per week during high school and
college seasons, and once every two weeks for age group swimmers,
planning for competitions poses training continuity problems. In addition,
when frequently accommodating rest before swim meets, the cumulative
effect of training is hard to achieve.
For this reason, it is a good idea to look at the season as a whole and work
toward a positive conclusion, allowing for benchmark or qualifying
opportunities along the way. By defining three levels of competitions, some
meets will be identified as priority events and incorporate planned breaks
in training, while some will be treated as part of the training.

Making Strength Training Count
PRACTICE MEETS
In preparation for practice meets, little or no change in the training routine
should be made. Just as we “swim through” some competitions, we can also
strength train through them. No best times should be expected. Rather than
best times, the objective should be stroke quality.
TARGET MEETS
In advance of target meets, the swimmer should be allowed some time to
rest. While some swimmers require more rest than others, even one or two
days break from the strength training routine can give a swimmer’s muscles
an opportunity to recover enough to perform well without seriously
interrupting the long-term strength training plan. Signs of improvement
toward the strength training objective should be visible. Some best times
can be expected.
CHAMPIONSHIP MEETS
Strength training should stop about two weeks before the championship meet
to allow the swimmer time to adapt and rebuild fully. Although some
swimmers get nervous that they will lose their strength, they should be
assured that the work they have done on land will be maintained by using it
in the pool during this strength training break. Best times should be achieved.
After the competition season, the off-season period can provide a good block
of time to build a solid base of well-rounded strength for the next competition
season. It also provides the opportunity to make modifications in a swimmer’s
strength training routine as determined through observation and evaluation
of the swimmer’s overall performance during the season past.

The Swimming Muscles
3 THE SWIMMING
MUSCLES
Swimming is considered by many to be the best form of full body exercise.
The well-documented cardiovascular benefits of swimming focus largely on
its healthy effect on the heart and lungs. Upon closer examination, we see
that the function of the heart and lungs is to carry oxygen-rich blood to the
working muscles and to transport oxygen-depleted blood away from them.
What makes swimming particularly good for the heart and lungs is that so
many muscles are being used at the same time.
In fact, swimming uses almost every muscle in the body in a coordinated
and repetitive, cycling manner that exposes them to sustained exertion in a
medium that is thicker than air. Well-conditioned swimmers, in general, have
extremely low resting heart rates, a measure of good fitness, and are known
to have one of the most developed capillary systems of all athletes. As a
swimmer is able to swim farther and faster, the oxygen demand of the
muscles increases. As the heart and lungs adapt to meet the demand, new
capillaries form, branching out from the existing blood supply network to
better provide the muscles in use with more oxygen.
Not only does swimming use more muscles at once than most other sports,
it also uses muscles in ways that we don’t often use them for other
activities. As erect beings, humans spend most of their time using our
muscles from the vertical position. However, because swimming is done from
a horizontal position, muscle exertion is initiated and carried out in different
planes than we are used to. To illustrate this point, compare the actions
31
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 31 12.07.11 12:11

--- Page 34 Text ---
Strength Training for Faster Swimming
performed with the arms in rowing with those used in swimming. They have
many similarities and use many of the same muscles. Rowing, in fact, is a
land exercise often recommended for swimmers. Both rowers and swimmers
initiate the arm movement with their arms extended in front of them. Both
pull toward the body. Both use a cycling arm action. However, in rowing, the
athlete’s body position is perpendicular to the arms. In swimming, the body
is positioned parallel to the arms. This fundamental difference distinguishes
the way the muscles exert themselves in swimming from the way they do in
rowing and most other land activities.
The foot position of swimmers is another good example of the unique way
muscles are used in swimming. Without the ground as a foundation, the feet
take on a completely different role in the water. The primary human foot
position is perpendicular to the leg, creating a base to stand on and spring
from. In swimming, this foot position is used only in a limited fashion for
the breaststroke kick, and for starts and turns. Instead, the primary foot
position for swimmers is pointed, heel to toe. From this position, it is the
top of the foot that applies the most resistance rather than the sole of the
feet. This seemingly minor difference is central to how the muscles in the
entire leg are used. In fact, it is common for people who are not used to
swimming to experience cramps in the calf and in the arch of the foot when
they swim due to the different requirements of the muscles when resistance
is applied with the top of the foot.
With all this in mind, a strength training program that will be effective for
swimmers must consider the full body requirements of swimming, the
unique ways swimmers use their muscles, and role each muscle group
performs in the act of swimming.
32

The Swimming Muscles
LINKING MUSCLE
MOVEMENT
Looking at the anatomy of the
human body and the distribution
of muscles, we can see that the
largest muscles are situated closer
to the center of the body. We can
also see that the fibers that make
up each muscle have a distinct
grain. By examining the direction
Muscle distribution and grain of this grain, as well as how the
muscles overlap each other, and
the point each muscle anchors to
the bone, we get an indication of what sort of action each muscle group is
capable of and responsible for. With this knowledge, we can better connect
muscles to movement and employ them to better move us through the water.
The sequence of muscles called to action in coordinated swimming works in
a chain reaction to move the swimmer forward. This flow of energy travels
through the body, passing from one muscle group to another throughout
each stroke cycle, producing efficient forward motion. Often referred to as
the kinetic chain, this connected movement is what a swimmer should strive
to simulate in strength training. Rather than isolating one muscle, consider
that that muscle is just part of a larger movement.
Imagine a baseball player standing at bat. His arms support the bat, but
when he swings to hit the ball, not only will the muscles of his arms come
into play but he will employ the muscles in his shoulders, chest, abdomen,
33
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 33 12.07.11 12:11

--- Page 36 Text ---
Strength Training for Faster Swimming
upper and lower back, and legs in one connected motion to send the ball
flying fast and far. If instead he used the muscles in his arms in isolation,
even with all his strength, the velocity and trajectory of the ball would land
it at the pitcher’s feet.
It is the same with swimming. An effective swimmer throws his or her body into
each stroke, employing not only the muscles of the arms but those in the
shoulders, chest, abdomen, upper and lower back, and legs to produce a
connected motion with each stroke that moves the body farther and faster, and
with less fatigue, than if the arms were used in isolation. An ineffective swimmer
moves his or her arms and legs independently of each other, expending a great
deal of effort to basically perform four separate actions, rather than one
connected action. Linking the muscles together in coordinated movement allows
the swimmer to produce better forward motion with less effort.
For this reason, strength training for swimmers should involve multiple
muscle groups, to simulate swimming motion as much as possible, rather
than training muscles in isolation.
MOVING AND STABILIzING
34
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 34 12.07.11 12:12

--- Page 37 Text ---
The Swimming Muscles
Muscles throughout the body are involved in creating forward movement for
the swimmer. Each of these muscles is dedicated to produce specific
motions that contribute to the swimming motion as a whole. While muscles
create movement for the swimmer, they also have another important
function. Muscles also perform as stabilizers. Like in other sports, muscles
provide stability to the body in motion and the joints. The muscles that
stabilize the knee, for example, keep the bones of the upper and lower leg
aligned. Imagine what would happen if there were no stabilizers at the knee;
walking, standing, and kicking would be impossible.
Unique to swimming is the additional role of the muscles in providing
stability to the moving body as it floats. Without the ground to stand on,
swimmers must create their own foundation of stability. In order to move
forward in swimming, muscles in one area of the body must be engaged in
balancing the effect of an action in another part of the body. These
stabilizing muscles maintain tension against the resistance that is being
applied. Without good tension, the effect that is produced is not forward
motion as desired but a fishtailing or bobbing movement.
Muscles are often categorized as movers and stabilizers. While some
muscles serve exclusively as stabilizers, many muscles actually perform both
functions. It is the larger surface layer muscles of the core and limbs that
can act both as both movers and stabilizers as the body goes through the
series of stroke actions that make up swimming. There are several examples
of this dual function in swimming.
THE TRAPEzIUS
The trapezius muscle is the large
muscle of the upper back that connects
the neck and the shoulders and the
back. The trapezius moves and rotates
the shoulders and neck, as well as
stabilizes the shoulder blades and
upper body. In freestyle, the trapezius
is engaged as a primary mover during
breathing as the head turns for the
inhale, and during recovery, as the
arm moves back to the beginning of
the stroke. It also serves as a stabilizer
assisting the swimmer in maintaining
35
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 35 12.07.11 12:12

--- Page 38 Text ---
Strength Training for Faster Swimming
a positive floating position throughout the entire stroke action. When a
swimmer presses his or her chest down to achieve the “downhill” floating
position, the shoulder blades move closer together. The trapezius is
employed in achieving and holding this position.
THE OBLIQUES
The obliques are bilateral abdominal
muscles located at either side of the “six
pack.” The function of the obliques is to
assist in rotation and sideways
stabilization of the body. In freestyle and
backstroke, the obliques act in
partnership, one as a mover and one as
a stabilizer, to produce the pendulum-
like roll that provides leverage to the arm
stroke. As the swimmer rolls into the
stroke, the oblique muscle on the
opposite side acts as the primary moving
muscle, while the oblique on the same
side works to stabilize the core and hips.
As the leading arm changes, so does the
function of the obliques.
THE DELTOIDS
The deltoids are the bilateral muscles
that cover the shoulders. The function
of the deltoids is to lift and assist with
rotation of the arm. In butterfly, freestyle
and backstroke, where the arm recovers
out of the water, the deltoids act as
primary movers to lift and return the
arm to the beginning of the stroke.
However, during the power phase of the
stroke, the deltoids serve as stabilizers
to the shoulder as the arm sweeps
through the three-dimensional path of
the underwater stroke.
36
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 36 12.07.11 12:12

--- Page 39 Text ---
The Swimming Muscles
THE QUADRICEPS
The quadriceps are the large and
powerful four-part muscles located in
the front of the thigh. The function of
the quads is to straighten the leg from
the hip to the knee and to provide
stability to the lower body and knee. In
flutter and dolphin kick, the quads are
the primary movers as they drive the
legs downward for the powerful
downbeat of the kick. However, during
the upbeat, they serve as knee stabilizers,
keeping it from hyper-extending.
Strength training should address both moving and stabilizing. Because the
stabilizing effect is more subtle, often strength-building efforts focus on the
moving function and ignore the stabilizing function. The importance of self-
stabilization in swimming cannot be emphasized enough. We must
understand that moving and stabilizing work in partnership. Efficient
movement in the water cannot work without both. Therefore strength for
moving and strength for stabilizing must be developed in a balanced manner.

Strength Training for Faster Swimming
WHAT CONNECTS EVERYTHING
The most obvious muscles used in
swimming are in the arms and legs. A
quick look at any swimmer in motion
shows us that our four limbs are
constantly moving. Although it might
appear that the arms and legs are our
primary movers, in fact, they account for
just a small part of a swimmer’s
propulsion. What connects the four
limbs in integrated motion is the core of
the body. Like a ceiling fan, with its
blades turning, what joins the action of
the blades, determines their speed, and
generates their power is the motor in
the middle.
By generating swimming movements from
the motor in the middle – the core –, a
swimmer employs the largest muscles to
initiate the action and then is able to
transfer that motion up to the arms and
down to the legs. The relatively smaller
muscles of the limbs may ultimately apply
the resistance, but the larger muscles of
the core are able to produce more force
and power, allowing a faster tempo to be
created and sustained.
The muscles of the core, both in the
front and the back of the body, are also
our primary stabilizers. As the connectors
between the upper and lower limbs, the
tension held in these muscles is central
to producing efficient and coordinated
stroke action. Without core tension, we
would not be able to achieve a unified
stroke, produce leverage, or maintain
balance and alignment throughout the
changing positions of the stroke.

TAKE A SWIMMING LESSON FROM A SEAL
Part of the Pinniped order (from the Latin meaning “wing foot”), we have to
look in awe at seals, who are not only among the fastest aquatic mammals
but are also the most efficient swimmers. Moving through the water at speeds
up to 25 miles per hour (about the same speed as dolphins and whales),
seals are at the top of the list in terms of least energy cost associated with
producing speed. It seems that seals have perfected swimming.
Like humans, seals are air-breathing mammals,
and like us, they have four limbs. However,
over millions of years, these descendents of
bears have adapted to using aquatic locomotion
so well that we should stop and pay attention.
Watching the seal swimming at high speed, we
see that it holds its front limbs flat against the
sides of its body and uses a narrow, undulating
motion that starts at the head and moves
down through its body.
This wave action is based on movement and stabilization of the seal’s spine
by the muscles that surround it. It is a swimming technique that
de-emphasizes the limbs for producing speed in the water. In fact, the seal
uses its front limbs for steering rather than propulsion. In addition, the
evolution of the seal’s rear limbs has led them to be fused into one great
limb down to the ankles, creating in essence an extension of the seal’s body.
By using the muscles of its powerful trunk to produce and control movement,
the seal has achieved a “limbless” swimming style that, in comparative
studies, has recorded it swimming a distance of one mile more than six
times faster than the fastest human swimmer, with five times less effort!
In the absence of evolutionary adaptations such as webbed toes and a
streamlined body shape that would make the human form more seal-like,
we can learn a lot about swimming from this creature and work toward
achieving a more seal-like technique that utilizes the muscles of our core to
generate more efficiency and swimming speed.

Strength Training for Faster Swimming
The muscles of the core are crucial to the overall effectiveness of swimming.
Core strength should be a main priority of any strength training program for
swimmers. Strengthening the core involves targeting a series of muscles that
work together to create a better foundation to swim from. These muscles
are listed below.
FRONT CORE MUSCLES
The front core muscles include the abdominals, most visibly the rectus
abdominus, commonly known as the “six-pack,” which allows forward and
backward bending, and provides stability to the core, especially in the
horizontal position. Located at either side of the rectus abdominus are the
obliques, which assist and stabilize rotation, an important action in long axis
strokes. Finally, the major muscles of the chest are the pectoralis major,
which are important movers of the arm, especially during the catch and in
the beginning of the power phase of all strokes. They also act as stabilizers
to the shoulders. Just below the pectoralis major are the serratus anterior,
named for their serrated appearance as they cover a portion of the first eight
ribs. The function of these muscles is to help raise the shoulder blades, and
stabilize the frontal and overhead motions that we use in swimming.

The Swimming Muscles
BACK CORE MUSCLES
The largest muscles of the back are the latisimus dorsi, or “lats,” which are
the primary pulling muscles and are highly developed by swimming. The lats
run bilaterally over the length of the back, from under each arm to the waist,
and wrap around the swimmer’s sides. The trapezius muscle connects the
neck to the shoulders and back. It enables a variety of movements including
raising and lowering the arm, rotation, turning the head and lifting the
shoulders, as well as stabilizing these actions. This is a crucial muscle to
maintain as it affects posture and shoulder position. The rhomboids, which
are located in the upper back underneath the trapezius, assist in pulling and
posture by moving the shoulder blades closer together. Also under the surface
layer of muscles in the upper back are the teres major and teres minor
muscles. Teres major assists in pulling the shoulders back and rotating the
arms outwardly. Teres minor are part of a group of shoulder stabilizing
muscles called the rotator cuff. They stabilize internal rotation of the arm.

Strength Training for Faster Swimming
UNDER THE SURFACE
The human body is wrapped with several
layers of muscles. It is tempting to target
solely the muscles we see, and while
these surface-layer muscles are key to
producing forward motion in swimming,
what lies underneath them is equally
important. The function of the underlying
muscles is largely to provide stability to
the bones at the joints.
In swimming, the joints that get the most
use are located in the shoulders. In
swimming, we reach, extend and align with
our shoulders, use them to apply resistance
to the water on multiple planes, and we use
them to throw our arms forward to do it all
over again. While the extraordinary shoulder
enables all of these motions, swimming puts
a lot of demand on them. Therefore, taking
care of our shoulders should be a priority.
Just like a race car designed to perform, to
ensure that it is ready to work at an optimal
level, regular maintenance of its systems is
key. Likewise, our shoulders are so crucial to
swimming that maintaining them is just as
important. We must both understand their
parts and attend to their mechanisms.
Shoulder maintenance should be considered a regular part of a strength
training program. We must strengthen them from the inside out.
The shoulder has two joints. The first, commonly known as the shoulder
joint, lies under the visible deltoid muscle. This joint allows the extensive
rotation of the arm that is so basic to swimming. It is a ball and socket type
joint, located where the top of the arm bone meets the shoulder blade.
Resembling a golf tee, the end of the arm bone sits on top of a shallow
socket in the shoulder blade. The remarkable range of motion allowed by this
joint ironically makes it vulnerable to instability. The “ball” is held in place
on the “tee” directly by four small muscles that surround the joint, stabilizing
it during motion. These muscles together are called the rotator cuff.
42
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 42 12.07.11 12:12

--- Page 45 Text ---
The Swimming Muscles
ROTATOR CUFF
The four muscles of the rotator cuff each have different functions:
Supraspinatus — stabilizes movement of the arm up and away from the body
Subscapularis — stabilizes internal arm rotation
Infraspinatus — stabilizes external arm rotation
Teres minor — stabilizes internal arm rotation and lifting of the arm
When one or more of the rotator cuff muscles is weak, damaged, or develops
unevenly, the bones are not held stable and can move around in the joint,
leading to inflammation of the surrounding tissues and shoulder pain. In
swimmers, poor stroke technique, overuse, or other muscular imbalances can
all contribute to rotator cuff problems. But even when these factors are
identified and corrected, it is necessary to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles
before the shoulder joint can regain stability and perform correctly.
SCAPULAE REGION
The second joint of the shoulder is located at
the intersection of the clavicle, commonly
known as the collarbone, and the top of the
scapulae, commonly known as the shoulder
blade. This joint performs like a hinge for the
shoulder blade.
The shoulder blade enables the overhead
motions we use in every swimming stroke. Like
the shoulder joint, the job of the shoulder
blade is to allow extensive motion. To facilitate
this, it is held in place only by the muscles, in
contrast to most other joints in the body,
which also have tendons and ligaments to
support them.
When a swimmer has poor posture, weak back
muscles or overly developed chest muscles, the
shoulder blades can move out of place. The
unstable shoulder blade slides upward, tipping
out from the back at the lower edge of the
bone and tipping into the adjacent structures at
the top of the bone. In some swimmers, this
condition is visible when looking at the back.

One or both of the shoulder blades stick out, away from the body (like wings)
and appear to be higher that usual. When the joint continues to do its job,
including repeated swimming motions from this wrong position, it can affect
the rotator cuff muscles, causing pain. While the rotator cuff is the site of the
pain, the cause is instability of the shoulder blade. Although most swimmers
with shoulder pain are diagnosed with rotator cuff problems, many physical
therapists agree that the primary and underlying cause of all shoulder problems
in swimmers is instability of the shoulder blade. Ongoing work to strengthen
the muscles that stabilize the shoulder blade should therefore be a priority.
By strengthening the stabilizing muscles that support both shoulder joints,
a swimmer can prevent the most common swimming-related health
problems. If a swimmer’s shoulder does become painful, rest, as well as
targeted strengthening exercises of the shoulder stabilizers, should be part
of the recovery process.

The Swimming Muscles
KEY MUSCLES FOR CERTAIN STROKES
We want to think in terms of multi-muscle swimming movements as much
as possible, however because the pull pattern, kicking action, leverage
and balance requirements in each of the four competitive swimming
strokes is unique, we must consider which muscles are especially
important to each stroke.
BUTTERFLY
The wide bilateral recovery of the butterfly places a demand on the trapezius
unlike any other stroke. In addition, the initial movements of the power phase are
done when the swimmer’s body is lower than the chest, requiring the pectoralis
major to engage in a
distinct lifting action.
Finally, as the dolphin
kick places the hips
in a higher position
relative to the body
than in other strokes,
the gluteus maximus
comes into play.
Key Butterfly Muscles

BACKSTROKE

forward through abdominal contraction of
the retus abdominus. The upward kick,
against gravity also puts a large demand on the quads. The unique catch
position, behind the head requires the rhomboids to contract heavily.
Finally, the elongated push portion of the arm stroke engages the triceps
more completely, and for a longer duration than in other strokes.
BREASTSTROKE
The unique requirements of the
breaststroke kick engage several
muscles that are not otherwise
used much in swimming. While the
hamstrings are used to raise the
heels, the hip flexors and abductors
perform and stabilize the sweeping
motion of the kick. As the foot
position goes from completely feet
flexed to completely pointed, the
calf muscles are also heavily
engaged. The abbreviated
breaststroke arm stroke employs
the biceps more so than the other
strokes during the in-sweep of the

stroke. Finally, the breaststroke’s
underwater recovery employs the
upper trapezius to shrug and roll
the shoulders forward as the arms
return to the extended position.
FREESTYLE
The three-dimensional sweeping pull pattern
of the freestyle taxes the shoulders more than
any other stroke. Rotator cuff muscles and
muscles of the scapular region work overtime
to stabilize the shoulders in freestyle, as the
arms rotate from a high elbow position to the
rear of the body during recovery to an
extended position in front of the body during
the power phase. Finally, the obliques serve
as primary movers in freestyle to produce the
corkscrew effect that sends power from the
core to the upper and lower limbs.

Stages of Development
4 STAGES OF
DEVELOPMENT AND
STRENGTH TRAINING
WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT
Physical development is a process that happens over years. It involves the
growth and maturing of every body system. It happens in its own time.
Although we may contribute to physical development through good nutrition
and healthy living, and we may even exert some control on heightening
performance through training, we cannot hurry the actual process of
development. While some have tried to influence this process with growth
hormones and other drugs, the rewards are very short-lived, and the
consequences are great and enduring as the body rebels by becoming sick,
injured or shutting down, unable to support artificially accelerated
development. Gradual, natural development allows the systems of the body
to physically support each other as they grow. The skeleton of a child cannot
support the muscles of an adult, but as the child’s bones grow, larger
muscles and more strength are possible. Gradual development also allows
time for important connections to be established between the brain and the
body. As we develop, our simple actions evolve into more complex actions
over time. Initial, awkward movements become coordinated and seamless.
While people develop at different rates, there is a predictable progression of
development that occurs in stages over a lifetime. When designing a strength
training program, the stage of development is an important consideration.
Strength training encompasses a wide variety of activities, which meet a wide
variety of objectives. For every stage, there are particular developmental
milestones that should correspond to strength training objectives. As the
stage of development changes, strength training objectives must change,
too. The content of a strength program should complement the swimmer’s
abilities at their particular stage and not impose demands that the swimmer
is not ready for. A strength training program designed with objectives and
activities that fit a swimmer’s stage of development will encourage faster
swimming at each stage of development and over a swimmer’s career.
49

Strength Training for Faster Swimming
AT WHAT AGE SHOULD STRENGTH TRAINING BEGIN?
The answer to this question is not as simple as how many birthdays a
swimmer has had. In fact, there is little benefit to using chronological age
as the measure for beginning a strength training program. Chronological age
does not tell us much. There are 10-year-olds who are 5’6” and could be
mistaken physically for 16-year-olds, and others who are 4’0” tall and could
be mistaken for 7-year-olds.
Chronological age also does not address swimming experience. Is the
swimmer starting competitive swimming as a teenager, or have they been
in the sport consistently since before Kindergarten? Once again, we return
to the swimmer’s athletic base. A swimmer of any age who does not have
an adequate athletic base must be trained as a beginner, although with
more physical development, he or she can sometimes advance more quickly
than a young beginner.
Rather than chronological age, a more meaningful measure to use is
physiological age. Physiological age, or the stage of physical development
of a swimmer, provides a better picture of what kind of strength training the
swimmer is ready for and can benefit from.
50

--- Page 53 Text ---
Stages of Development
So, at what age should swimmers begin strength training? From day one, but
the content of the strength training program must be carefully designed for
the appropriate level of physical development and swimming experience.
SPECIFIC WORK FOR SPECIFIC STAGES
We will assign the following categories to the various stages of physical
development for the purpose of identifying strength training objective,
describing appropriate activities, and suggesting the frequency and duration
of strength training sessions. Older beginners should start with the same
activities as the first stage listed:
• Elementary
• Pre-adolescence
• Adolescence
• Young Adult
• Adult
• Senior
51
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 51 12.07.11 12:12

--- Page 54 Text ---
Strength Training for Faster Swimming
ELEMENTARY
At this stage, the child’s head is
proportionally large, and hands and feet
are small, leading to some balance
issues. The upper body and arm muscles
are also generally less developed than
lower body and leg muscles. Some
children have big bellies, which should
be evaluated before labeling the child as
overweight. Often a large belly is the
result of a growth-related posture
imbalance in which the spine curves
toward the belly. It is a condition that is
usually soon outgrown. Children at this
stage have an immense amount of
energy but limited coordination and very
little endurance.
The objective of strength training at this stage of development is to build
a solid athletic base. Appropriate strength training sessions three to five
days a week, for about 15 minutes, should include activities that promote
the five areas of general athleticism – using the child’s own resistance
only – in short periods of work followed by periods of rest. This work
should be fun in order to hold the characteristic short attention span of
young children as long as possible.
PRE-ADOLESCENCE
Children at this stage of development
experience rapid growth in both height
and weight. Often the child has spurts
where he or she grows lengthwise and
then widthwise, leading to periods of
awkwardness. Ultimately, the trunk and
limbs lengthen and more strength is
possible. Stamina also increases and
coordination steadily develops. Balance
eventually improves.
The objective of strength training at this
stage of development is to improve
stability, coordination, and to build

Stages of Development
THE EARLY DEVELOPER AND THE LATE BLOOMER
At age 11, Peter was a dedicated member of the swim team who diligently swam five
days a week, focusing on good technique and making every interval. He also
participated in strength and quickness drills led by his coach three times a week. Peter’s
work ethic was so admirable that he was given a trophy at the team’s annual awards
banquet. Peter attended swim meets regularly, holding clearly in his mind the goal of
swimming faster than ever before.
One day, after placing fifth in his favorite event, the 50 butterfly, he looked at the
field of swimmers at the finish and spotted his teammate Allen raising his fist in
victory. “Good for him!” Peter thought momentarily as a sense of confusion welled
up inside of him and set in. Allen wasn’t a hard worker. He fooled around a lot and
snuck out of practice early all the time. How could he have won the race?
Peter’s coach approached both his swimmers with enthusiastic congratulations. As they
stood side by side, Peter was struck by the fact that his teammate was nearly a head
taller than he was. He had never noticed how much Allen had grown or how husky his
voice had become. At the end of the meet, he confided in his coach, asking why he
wasn’t improving like Allen was. His wise coach pointed out that Peter was progressing
and, in fact, had done his best time. He said it was important to be patient and keep
up his good training. “Your day will come, Peter,” the coach told him.
Peter held on to his coach’s words. Over the next year and a half, Peter trained
regularly, both in and out of the water, developing a well-defined six pack that he
was proud of. Eventually, Allen decided to trade in his jammers for a soccer ball.
Peter kept whittling away slowly and patiently at his times in competition and, after
advancing to the 13-14 division, he adopted the 100 fly as his new favorite.
At the first meet of spring, Peter stepped up on the blocks, seeded tenth in the fly.
He swam the first 50 with ease and precision but felt uneasy when he found himself
with more energy than usual going in the last lap. Intent on giving the race his best,
he put his head down and accelerated his stroke tempo. When the final wall came,
Peter looked up and was shocked to see he had won the race, erasing nine full
seconds from his previous best time. As he emerged from the pool, he heard a
familiar voice. “I told you!” the coach said. Peter grinned widely. It was only then
that he observed that he was not looking up at his coach, but looking at him eye
to eye. He realized at that moment that his patience had paid off, and it was finally
his turn to shine.
53

Strength Training for Faster Swimming
power. Appropriate strength training activities for this stage of development
include exercises that address core stability balance and tempo, using the
child’s own resistance only. This is a good stage to start focusing on
perfecting form that will carry through to later stages of development. Such
work can be done three to four days a week in sessions of about 20 minutes.
ADOLESCENCE
During adolescence, athletes go
through a time of continuous change
that includes physical maturing and
weight gain. As they go through
puberty, athletes experience periods
of rapid strength gain alternating
with periods where strength lags
behind their growth. At times, their
physical changes are accompanied
by awkwardness and self-
consciousness. At other times, they
are accompanied by bravado and
testing of their new characteristics.
The objective at this stage of
development is building power,
force, stability, and coordination.
When well supervised, swimmers
can make important progress during
this time, with gains in applicable
strength. Sessions of 30 minutes or
more, five days a week should include self-resistance work, medicine balls and
some stretch bands, accompanied by clearly stated objectives. This combination
of training can encourage swimmers to focus on achieving great improvements
in swimming speed.
YOUNG ADULT
At this stage, the athlete has adult physical characteristics and size. This is a
period when the athlete is at the peak of strength and performance potential.
With a solid foundation of athleticism, swimming and strength work, the now
fully mature swimmer can make huge and continuing gains in speed with
dedication to a solid training routine and a healthy lifestyle.
54
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 54 12.07.11 12:12

--- Page 57 Text ---
Stages of Development
The objective at this stage is
maximizing force, power, and
explosiveness. A strength program
that encompasses weight training,
stretch bands, medicine balls and
self-resistance can encourage
development of maximum strength
by the athlete’s adult body that can
be applied to swimming faster
than ever before. A program of
strength work four days a week for
an hour can net the force, power,
explosiveness, and stability results
of a lifetime.
ADULT
During this stage, a very gradual
decline of muscle size and strength
is expected. The shape of the body
changes subtly over time, frequently
expanding at the waistline. With the
obligations of “real life,” the adult
athlete faces less training time and,
in general, a less active lifestyle.
For the adult athlete, the objective
is maintenance. Holding on to
physical fitness is certainly a
challenge. As the years go by,
maintenance should be viewed as
improvement! With an ongoing
routine of frequent swimming and
strength work, it is possible for
a swimmer to maintain his or her
speed into the 40s and 50s.
55
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 55 12.07.11 12:12

--- Page 58 Text ---
Strength Training for Faster Swimming
A routine that includes strength training for an hour encompassing weights,
stretch bands, medicine balls and self-resistance for three days a week will
provide such maintenance. At this stage, it is important to make time for two
days of solid rest as recovery just takes longer.
SENIOR
In the golden years, decline in the size and strength of muscles is evident,
which sometimes contributes to balance and mobility problems. In addition,
seniors can face bone strength and flexibility issues affecting posture and
range of motion. Still, the senior who stays active and strong will be in a
much better position to make the most of his or her ability to move freely
through the water.
At this stage of development, the
objective is flexibility and weight-
bearing activity. Strength training is
an essential part of a swimmer’s
training routine. A program that
includes conservative weights,
stretch cords, and medicine balls,
as well as self-resistance, two to
three days a week for 30 minutes
or more can produce bone density
improvements, slow muscle decline,
and along with the typical benefits
of swimming, contribute to a better
quality of life.

JUST KEEP SWIMMING
Joy was a dedicated mother. For almost two decades, she devoted herself to the
task of raising her twins to become happy, healthy, productive adults. She
parented to encourage individuality, responsibility, compassion and self-respect.
She strived to be a good example to her children. On their 18th birthday, Joy felt
an immense sense of pride. Still, shortly thereafter, when they moved out on
their own, she felt empty inside. A divorced 48-year-old, Joy looked at herself in
the mirror and asked, “Who am I?” Her empty house and the new availability of
time took quite a while to adjust to, but one day, Joy woke up with an idea.
One of the good examples she had provided for her children was to maintain a
regular physical fitness routine throughout their childhood. An active competitive
swimmer in her youth, Joy had chosen swimming as her fitness activity, going to
the pool twice a week before daylight for an hour or so to swim laps. Although
she was no longer a speed demon in the pool, she had maintained a healthy
weight, good muscle tone and flexibility that other mothers often admired.
Now that she didn’t have to hurry back home to meet the responsibilities of the
household, she decided to re-dedicate herself to her sport. She increased her
swimming time, adding another day a week, and then another half hour per
session. She added variety to her swimming routine by doing sets and different
strokes. It was not long before Joy started feeling the effects of her efforts and
soon was able to do 100s on the 1:30 like she had when she was a teenager.
Swimming became the passion in Joy’s life. She loved the challenge and
confidence that swimming gave her. She kept track of her workouts, recording
her yardage and tracking her progress toward benchmarks she set for herself.
She read books on swimming science and technique, and incorporated what she
learned into her swimming routine, even adding some stretch cord work to her
program three times a week.
At age 65, Joy was thrilled to become the grandmother of twins. To celebrate this
milestone, she decided to enter a competition for adult swimmers. With
anticipation, but no expectations, she arrived at the event and was pleased that
she, by no means, was the oldest swimmer present. Elated by the camaraderie
and positive atmosphere she encountered, she swam to a second place finish in
the 200 backstroke. The winner, a woman of at least 80, congratulated her as she
climbed easily out of the pool. “Maybe, I’ll see you at the next meet,” Joy
responded. “Yes, you will,” the woman asserted. “Until then, just keep swimming.”

Let’s Get Specific
5 LET’S GET SPECIFIC
TYPES OF STRENGTH TRAINING THAT BENEFIT SWIMMING
This section introduces five kinds of strength training that benefit swimming
in terms of building strength that is useable in the water. Under each of the
five types of activity, specific exercises are listed. Each exercise has been
selected for its transferability to swimming in terms of directionality, tempo
and multi-muscle engagement. Each exercise is described, illustrated, and
categorized by the area of the body it primarily targets. It is important to
remember that although an exercise is described as targeting a particular
area of the body, multiple muscles are involved, both in the target area, as
well as in other areas of the body. For instance, exercises that target the
upper body and arms usually involve the core as well.
While all strength training is based on resistance, each type of exercise
presented provides a different kind of challenge to the muscles. Some types
are appropriate for all swimmers, but some are appropriate only at more
advanced stages of development and are noted as such.
SELF-RESISTANCE
Self-resistance refers to using the weight of one’s own body as the load.
“Baby stuff!” you might say; far from it. Some of the most beneficial and
challenging exercises for swimmers of all levels fall under this category. Self-
resistance work, in fact, should be a part of all strength training programs,
59
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 59 12.07.11 12:12

--- Page 62 Text ---
Strength Training for Faster Swimming
as it resembles swimming very closely in terms of multi-muscle movements.
Self-resistance work promotes core stability and balance, coordination and
tempo. In addition, force, power, and explosiveness can all be developed
very successfully with self-resistance work.
Beneficial self-resistance activities include:
FULL BODY
Burpies — Stand, squat, extend
legs, squat and stand. Repeat
the sequence.
Cartwheels — A gymnastics
handspring where the body
turns over sideways and back to
the standing position with the
arm and legs spread like the
spokes of a cartwheel.
Crab Walk — Walk on all four
limbs with the back toward the
ground.
Crawling — Walk on hands and
feet.

Let’s Get Specific
Speed Walking — As in the
Olympic sport, a rapid heel to
toe walking stride using leverage
from the arms and core.
Cherry Pickers — Stand with
legs wider than shoulders. Bend
down and with both hands,
touch left foot with both hands.
Then touch the ground between
the feet, move to the right foot
and then stand up straight.
Repeat.
Jumping Jacks — Standing with
arms at sides, jump up and clap
your hands over your head at
the same time as you spread
your legs and land in that
position. Recover along the
same path and repeat in rapid
succession.
Running — Use swift heel to toe
strides on one foot with the
opposite side arm bent at the
elbow, and move in the same
direction simultaneously.

WHERE ARE THE PUSH-UPS?
The traditional push-up, a mainstay of modern exercise and a standard
measure of fitness level, does not appear among these recommended self-
resistance exercises intentionally. Although countless push-ups are done
regularly by pro-athletes, military recruits, and even Rocky, as part of their
physical training routines, it is the belief of this coach that the push-up
should not be part of a swimming strength training program.
The push-up does not address swimming very well. It does not simulate
swimming motion at all, as the direction of the resistance is perpendicular
to the athlete’s body, rather than parallel. While the push-up does promote
core and upper body strength, it also taxes the shoulders in ways that do
not benefit swimming. Extensive push-ups can develop muscles that
interfere with a swimmer’s range of motion in the water, especially during
arm extension. Further, the push-up shortens shoulder stabilizers and chest
muscles where they already tend to be too short among swimmers.
Activities that are less problematic for swimmers, that promote swimming-
specific core and upper body strength better than the push-up, include the
plank, side plank and corner push out.

THE MEDICINE BALL
The medicine ball is a weighted ball that can be used to perform a wide
variety of strength training work. The medicine ball provides a compact
external load in useful weights from 1 to 25 pounds. Even with this minor
amount of added resistance, medicine balls are not recommended for
swimmers in the earliest stages of development for two reasons. First, they
are weights, and the bones of young athletes are not physically ready to
support more than their own body weight. Second, although medicine balls
may look like toys, and in many ways act like a regular ball (they can be
tossed, rolled and caught), they must be handled as tools. They are heavy
and, if dropped on a foot or thrown at someone’s face, they can cause injury.
Medicine balls should be used only by athletes with the maturity to handle
them carefully.
There are many benefits of medicine ball training. It allows the swimmer to
move through multiple planes, which simulates the movement used in
swimming, unlike traditional weightlifting, which is done in a single plane.
Medicine ball activities encourage the swimmer to develop both moving and
stabilizing functions evenly as he or she must exert effort to move the ball
and stabilize to control the ball. Medicine ball training also helps develop
force and explosiveness very well, as the swimmer must react quickly to the
weight of the ball when it comes toward him and when he sends it into
flight. Finally, medicine ball training encourages coordination by using multi-
muscle movements rather than isolated muscle efforts.
Medicine balls can be used by an individual and, in some cases, with a
partner. Beneficial activities for swimmers include:

STRETCH CORDS
Without a doubt, stretch cords provide one of the best swimming-specific
methods of strength training. Stretch cords are simply lengths of surgical
tubing with loops or handles for each hand. When secured in the middle to a
stationary pole, the stretch cord enables the swimmer to simulate the entire
range of motion that makes up the power phase of the stroke against
resistance. Stretch cords also require the use of an accelerating motion to
accomplish the action successfully, exactly like swimming. The motion is
repeated with a controlled reverse action or recovery between each exertion.
The swimmer can use a tempo equal to his or her swimming tempo against
resistance or practice an “ideal” higher tempo. Stretch cords also promote core
stabilization, as the swimmer must maintain constant tension in the body from
the standing position, bent forward at the waist, while the arms are moving.
Stretch cords are available in a variety of thicknesses, which determine their
resistance. Because too much resistance will make proper technique
impossible, it is important to start with a stretch band that has less resistance
and work up to more resistance when good technique is maintained.
The following stretch cord exercises are highly recommended:

STreTch­BandS
Closely related to the stretch cord is the stretch band. The stretch band is
an excellent tool for shoulder maintenance. Also known as a therapy band,
this narrow sheet of latex provides much less resistance than the stretch
cord, which is not recommended for shoulder stabilization work.
Stretch band exercises for shoulder stability include:

EXERCISE MACHINES
Exercise machines provide a great aerobic component to a land-based
routine, raising the heart rate and contributing to endurance. Many are
valuable for developed athletes as a warm-up before lifting weights or
performing other strength training activities. A few contribute additional
opportunities for building force and explosiveness as well. As they are
designed for adult frames, they should
not be used by young children.
The best exercise machines for warm-ups
are listed below:
Exercise Bike — A stationary bicycle that
can be set at various resistances. Comes
in reclining or upright models. Either
model is good, but with the upright
model, use without holding handlebars
for good stabilization practice.

Elliptical Trainer — A machine
with pedals that move in an
elliptical cycle and, along with
an adjustable incline, simulate
running without impact. Some
models come with arm levers
that alternate, and these are
preferable for a good full-body
warm-up.
Treadmill — A machine with a
moving ramp that can be
adjusted to different speeds
and inclines for walking and
running. Use without holding
handrails for good stabilization
practice.
Additional beneficial exercise
machines for swimmers include:
Swim Bench — Replicates
swimming motion, including
accelerating movement, and
encourages correct technique
against more resistance than the
water provides. It also encourages
the swimmer to accelerate move-
ments throughout each exertion.
Erg — Also known as the rowing
machine, the erg builds force
and power very well, closely
replicating the full-body
requirements of rowing, which
in many ways are similar to

WEIGHTS
Weightlifting is recommended only
for athletes who have reached the
young adult stage of development.
Real consequences can occur when
weights are used too early in a
swimmer’s development. It is not a
myth! Growth plates in young
developing swimmers can be
damaged under the load of weights.
When a swimmer is physically ready
for weights, they provide an efficient
way to build muscle strength. Weight
rooms are full of equipment and
machines, some which address
swimming and some that don’t. It is
important to remember that we are trying to simulate swimming movement,
directionality and tempo as much as possible.
WEIGHT MACHINES
Weight machines that use pulley
systems generally address swimming
movement in terms of directionality,
range of motion, and by requiring
accelerating movements. There are
also machines that work on lever
systems. Some of these are beneficial
to swimmers. Some, however, apply
resistance in the reverse direction of
swimming, and others are designed
to isolate muscles rather than to
engage multi-muscle movements.
Weight machines that are especially
beneficial to swimmers include:

FREE WEIGHTS
Beyond weight machines, there is also equipment known as free weights.
These include hand-held dumbbells, barbells and bars. Work with free
weights can be useful as it requires the swimmer to stabilize the weight
while exerting. However, many free weight exercises do not address
swimming motion as the resistance applied is in the reverse direction of
swimming. Free weight activities for swimmers should be carefully evaluated
in terms of objective and be included as a primary activity only if they
simulate swimming motion.
Free weight activities that are especially beneficial
to swimmers include:

freestyle, holding the elbow
still. Recover along the same
path. Repeat. Do the same
exercise with the other arm.
Barbell Curls — Stand with a
barbell held with both hands
shoulder length apart, palms
forward. Raise the barbell to the
shoulders without moving the
elbows. Recover along the same
path. Repeat.
LEGS
Dumbbell Squats — Stand with
the feet positioned at least as
wide as shoulders. Hold a
dumbbell at the sides, looking
forward the whole time, and
squat until the knees are at a
maximum of 90 degrees, then
stand. Repeat.

The Fundamentals
6 THE FUNDAMENTALS
Just as in swimming where you must know how to float right before you can
swim right, likewise with strength training, you must have a clear
understanding of the basics before you can gain the results of faster
swimming. Fundamental principles represent the foundation from which you
can structure a program that will have predictable and positive results.
HOW MUCH AND HOW MANY?
These are very important questions when it comes to
strength training. We must clearly understand the
significance of how much resistance, how many repetitions,
at what rate, and how much frequency and duration is
necessary in relation to our strength training objectives.
Without this knowledge, we could end up with a different
outcome than intended. More quantity does not always
translate to more strength. Knowing “how much” and “how
many” is as important as knowing which exercises to do.
HOW MUCH RESISTANCE?
With self-resistance work, the load that is resisted is
exclusively the swimmer’s body weight, but when external
load is added, as with stretch cords, medicine balls and
weights, the question of how much resistance needs to be
answered. In general, to build power, the athlete should be
able to repeat the exercise with a load 12 to 15 times
without failure. If he or she cannot do this, the load is too
much. If it is extremely easy, the load is too little. In
contrast, to build force, a larger load should be used. The
athlete should be able to repeat an exercise only about three to five times.
Again, if he or she cannot do this, the load is too much. If it is extremely
easy, the load is too little.
HOW MANY REPETITIONS?
We also need to know how many times to repeat a particular action or
sequence. We count repetitions, or reps, and we count sets. A rep is a single
action of the exercise. Use the guidelines described above for reps. A set is
a group of reps. Multiple sets have rest between them. As far as how many
97
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 97 12.07.11 12:13

--- Page 100 Text ---
Strength Training for Faster Swimming
sets to do, when the objective is force or explosiveness, fewer sets are
done, and sometimes, only a single set is performed. When the objective is
power or endurance, more sets are done. Most people do three to five sets
when training for power.
HOW MUCH RATE?
How fast or slowly an exercise is repeated also is determined by the strength
training objective. An exercise done at a faster rate tends to build force and
explosiveness. An exercise done at slower rate tends to build power.
With some exercises, it is possible to simulate swimming tempo very well
by allowing the athlete to perform repetitions at a rate of about one per
second. Stretch cord work is a good example of this. Some exercises are not
designed for stroke tempo work, so do not attempt to achieve such a
tempo. The Lat Pull is a good example of an exercise that should not be
used for tempo work as it is very important not to rush the recovery, but to
control it instead.
HOW RESISTANCE, REPETITIONS AND RATE WORK TOGETHER
To get the intended outcome, we look at the amount of resistance, or load,
the number of repetitions and sets, and the rate that the exercise is
performed together. For instance, if our objective is to develop force, we must
pair fewer repetitions and sets with more load. If we try to build force by
increasing both the number of repetitions and the load at the same time, the
swimmer will soon experience failure, and the objective will not be met. In
contrast, if our objective is to develop power, we must pair more repetitions
and sets with less resistance. If we try to build power by increasing both the
number of repetitions and the load at the same time, the swimmer will soon
experience failure, and the objective will not be met.
HOW MUCH FREQUENCY AND DURATION?
Frequency refers to the number of strength training sessions in a week,
month or season. Duration refers to how long each session is. Frequency
should be determined by the swimmer’s stage of development in conjunction
with the strength training content. For instance, a program using weights,
for developmentally advanced swimmers should accommodate rest and
recovery time between sessions. A program for beginners, however, that is
based on a good variety of self-resistance activities can be done several
days in a row in order to develop a good athletic base. Swimmers in the
adult or senior stages of development should build in more rest days, as
recovery takes longer.

The Fundamentals
BEFORE OR AFTER SWIMMING?
When is the best time to do strength training, before or after swimming? The
debate is ongoing.
On the one hand, it is clear that strength training before swimming
activates the muscles that will be used in the pool. Swimming-specific
strength training before swimming also reinforces good form in the water.
Studies have shown that the nervous system connections established and
practiced on land carry over to stroke actions in the pool when swimming
directly follows land activities. Finally, many believe that swimmers who
swim regularly after a strength training develop better endurance, as
swimming, which builds endurance very well, becomes an extension of a
“super workout” begun on land, requiring the swimmer to adapt to a
greater workload.
On the other hand, some believe that since swimming elongates the muscles,
strength work that follows swimming ensures that the swimmer’s muscles are
well warmed up and less vulnerable to injury from the demands of land
training. They also argue that when strength training follows the water
workout, the quality of the swimming is higher because a swimmer who is
tired after strength training practices swimming slower, with less force, power
and explosiveness, reinforcing undesirable habits. Finally, many take the
position that swimming first allows the swimmer to feel and utilize the
strength that he or she has adapted to in the water where it counts.
So which is best? There are valid arguments for both. From the perspective
of preparing a swimmer to race, to be ready to perform under less than ideal
conditions, including poor weather, crowded warm-up areas and meet
delays, a program that uses a bit of both approaches should be considered.
By mixing it up, the swimmer will practice adapting to different situations.
Further, changing the order of the training routine from time to time will
keep it from becoming boring, as the swimmer will stay challenged to
perform under different circumstances.
The final decision should be based on what best works for the individual
athlete.
99

--- Page 102 Text ---
Strength Training for Faster Swimming
Scheduling rest time is as important as scheduling workout time. Even
routines based solely on self-resistance work should allow at least two days
off per week. When the content of the strength work includes external load,
at least three rest days are recommended. A routine of alternating work days
and rest days works well. Some athletes use a daily schedule, by alternating
days for upper body and lower body. Attention should be paid to levels of
fatigue when using this model. A schedule of two work days in a row,
followed by one rest day has also proven successful. The particular schedule
should consider the rest requirements of the individual swimmer, assuming
he or she is swimming five to six days a week.
The duration of each strength training session should also be determined
by a swimmer’s particular stage of development, as well as his or her
swimming experience. In the early stages, sessions should be quite short
because not a great deal of endurance has been developed. Still, a lot of
work can be accomplished in 15 to 30 minutes! As the swimmer matures
physically, longer training sessions of an hour or more are beneficial, both
because the swimmer is capable of more and because more types of
activities, more repetitions, and more sets take more time.
Answering these fundamental questions must be done before strength
training begins. To achieve more swimming speed, careful analysis of “how
much and how many” should be done with the specific objective of the
swimmer in mind.

The Fundamentals
START RIGHT
SAFETY
Like the “No Diving” sign at the shallow end of the
pool, safety rules are there for a reason. Although you
may be lucky diving into shallow water, the
consequences are real and grave. When safety rules
for conduct and equipment use are in place, observe
them with respect. If safety rules are not in place, it is
the responsibility of the supervisor to establish them.
Supervision is a must, especially when children and
inexperienced swimmers are engaged in strength training activities. The
supervisor must ensure that safety rules are understood and followed. The
supervisor must ensure that each activity is performed correctly and safely
by each swimmer. The supervisor must ensure that each activity is
appropriate for the swimmer’s stage of development and experience.
Everyone engaged in strength training should use a proactive approach to
preventing accidents by:
Training With a Partner
All strength training, especially with weights, should be done with a partner
who can spot and assist, and observe technique.
Handling Weights Correctly
Lift weights from the floor using your legs rather than your back. Weights
should never be dropped; hey can break bones. They should also not be
left on the floor to trip on. Medicine balls should never be thrown at the
face or the groin, only at the chest and when the person is looking.
Wearing Shoes
Although most swimmers are very comfortable in bare feet around the pool
deck, shoes should be mandatory for any strength training activity involving
external weight or moving with impact on the feet. While many exercises can
be done safely without shoes on the pool deck or gym, it is never acceptable
to be barefoot in the weight room where obstacles are many or when using
any exercise machine with moving parts. Self-resistance work that involves
running, jumping, or changing directions can put excessive pressure on bare
feet. Shoes will provide support as well as protection from sharp objects
hidden in grass and rough surfaces.

Tying Hair Back
Long hair back should be tied back to ensure good visibility at all times and
to avoid entanglement in machines.
WARM-UP
The purpose of warming up before strength training is exactly the same as
at the beginning of a swimming workout. Warming up prepares the body to
work by loosening up and activating the muscles, and raising the heart rate
to circulate oxygen-rich blood to the muscles. Swimmers should spend at
least a quarter of their strength training time warming up.
Good warm-up activities include:
• Relaxed Arm Circles
• Hanging Arm Circles
• Cherry Pickers
• Jumping Jacks
• Running
• Skipping
• Side Steps
• Stairs
• Skating
• Jump Rope

The Fundamentals
TAKE IT EASY ON THE STRETCHING!
Stretching has long been a traditional part of warming up before exercise,
but the fact is, stretching has injured many swimmers. There are two reasons
for this:
1. Stretching does not prepare the body to work, as a warm-up should do.
By using valuable warm-up time for stretching, a swimmer runs out of time
to do activities that raise the heart rate and activate the muscles. Beginning
a workout in this state leaves the body more prone to injury. In addition,
without a good warm-up, some or all of the workout is wasted because the
swimmer is not prepared to exert.
2. In general, swimmers have very mobile joints, so stretching is really
unnecessary. This is especially true of shoulder stretching. Because the
shoulders are so central to swimming, they are commonly the site of
soreness for many swimmers. In an effort to relieve soreness, we turn to
stretching. But what happens when these muscles are stretched is that too
much looseness develops, which can lead to joint stability problems during
swimming, producing more soreness and pain.
Instead of stretching as a warm-up, swimmers should spend warm-up time
doing full-body activity with gradually progressive effort. As far as the
shoulders, rather than stretching, the focus should be on stabilizing mobility
at the joints to keep them operating correctly. This is done through specific
shoulder stabilization exercises, as shown on page 94-95.
If stretching is done at all, it should be done after exercise. It should be very
conservative and target only the large muscles, not the joints. Even this kind
of stretching should be gentle and gradual. Under no circumstances should
any bouncing action be used. Under no circumstances should another
swimmer apply external stretching pressure for you. Under no circumstances
should stretching hurt, either during or after you do it.
103

--- Page 106 Text ---
Strength Training for Faster Swimming
When exercise machines are available, warm-ups
can include:
• Exercise Bike
• Elliptical Trainer
• Treadmill
COOL DOWN
Just as after swimming, the cool down is important
to let body systems and muscles adjust to the
resting state. After exercise, allow several minutes
of slow, continuous activity so the heart rate can
return to normal and the muscles can begin to
relax. One of the best cool down activities is
walking.
FORM
Form is as important in strength training as it is in
the water. Form determines the manner in which the
swimmer’s body interacts with the resistance. It is
important to spend time perfecting the swimmer’s
form on any particular exercise before it is repeated
over and over. Correct form ensures that the
swimmer will use the intended muscles groups in the
intended fashion. Incorrect form can lead to poor
results, including injury.
POSTURE
Our symmetrical bodies are designed with many
bilateral muscles, including the lats, the obliques,
the pectoralis major and the deltoids, among
others. However, when one part of our body is out
of alignment, the mirror image muscles are very
adept at taking over the work. Repeated exercise
with poor posture can result in bilateral muscles
developing unevenly as one side compensates for
the other. As swimming depends on bilateral
strength, maintaining good posture is very
important.
104
strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 104 12.07.11 12:13

--- Page 107 Text ---
The Fundamentals
Good posture starts with the awareness of your body position and stance.
One of the most positive steps you can take is to develop core strength that
stabilizes posture from the front and the back. This will help keep shoulders,
hips and knees in alignment, encouraging strength to be developed in a
more balanced manner.
BREATHING
Breathing function is an essential part
of athletic performance. Posture plays
an important part in good breathing
function. Bad posture encumbers
breathing capacity by allowing the trunk
of the body to be compressed, leaving
less room for the lungs to expand and
contract. One of the quickest and best
ways to improve your breathing during
exercise is to stand up straight.
Breathing rhythm is very important. Just as we use rhythmic breathing in the
pool, it should also be used during strength training. Avoid holding the
breath during exertion. Instead, just like swimming, and most all other
sports, exhale during exertion and inhale during recovery. Exchanging air
properly will keep your muscles better supplied with the oxygen they need
to perform. It will also keep you from fatiguing as quickly.
CONTROL
It is important to control every movement against resistance, both in the power
phase and recovery. Always maintain balance and stability during the power
phase. Always return to the starting
position gently and with less speed. Never
allow an external load to jerk the limbs
back to the starting position.

7 ROUTINES AND
CIRCUITS
This section contains strength training routines and circuits for all stages of
development. Because the six stages of development identified earlier in
this book are not isolated but are more of a continuum, merging one into
the next, the routines and circuits are presented in four progressive levels
with specific content to meet particular developmental objectives. Use these
routines and circuits as examples for structure and content, then tailor them
to the needs of the individual swimmer.
Check with your health care provider before starting a strength training
program.
STRENGTH TRAINING ROUTINES
The following routines are presented in a sequence beginning with a
warm-up and ending with a cool down. When a double space appears, extra
rest should be taken.

Strength Training for Faster Swimming
STRENGTH TRAINING CIRCUITS
Circuits are made up of a series of exercise stations that are performed on
a time interval. The swimmer goes from one exercise to another without
resting. As much work as possible should be performed at a station during
the time interval. A swimmer may work through the circuit alone or there can
be a swimmer at each station. A good warm-up should be done before
beginning the circuit. Circuits are very flexible, as more swimmers can be
accommodated easily by adding stations.
LEVEL 1 CIRCUITS
These circuits are appropriate for athletes at the elementary and pre-
adolescent stages of development, and older athletes at the beginning level.

Shoulder Maintenance Routine
This exercise routine is designed to maintain and build shoulder stability for
swimmers. It can be done every other day in addition to other strength training
activities. Along with a stretch band, a small weight is required. Make sure each
exercise is done with correct form as described on pages 65, 82-83, and 94-95.
These exercises, done on an ongoing basis, will encourage balanced shoulder
stability and strength in the most crucial and vulnerable swimming joints. If
one or more of these exercises causes immediate pain, skip it and go on to
the others. Give the skipped exercise another try each time this routine is done.

Measuring Progress
8 MEASURING PROGRESS
How do we know if our strength training is working? Ultimately, over time,
we should see results in the pool. But we should also see progress within
our strength work. Recording various exercises that are done regularly in
terms of load, number of repetitions and sets and rate will allow us to track
our progress.
The Strength Training Log presented on page 162 provides a basic structure
for tracking progress. Make copies and use one sheet per month to record
your strength training progress over time. At the beginning of each month,
fill in the exercises that you will track on the left side of the page. Then,
after each strength training session throughout the month, record your
results for those exercises. Record the number of sets, repetitions or other
information specific to the exercise for comparison.
At the end of the month, do a test set to gauge adaptation. A test set takes
three of the exercises you have been doing throughout the month and
increases the difficulty of each. The exact way the difficulty is increased
depends on the objective. For instance, if your objective is more force, more
load would be attempted. If your objective is tempo, more repetitions would
be attempted in a fixed time. At the bottom of the Progress Log, a space is
provided to record the results of a monthly test set.
If test set results show that you are able to perform the exercises with
increased difficulty, then as you begin a new month of strength training, use
the test set degree of difficulty as your new base.
Remember to focus on your objective. If you are training for more force,
don’t expect to see much progress in terms of number of repetitions. Look
instead for progress in terms of amount of resistance. If you are training for
more power, don’t expect to see much progress in terms of the load. Look
instead for rate, or number of repetitions.
Progress tracked that does not meet the objective, should be watched
closely over several more weeks. Random progress across the board can be
expected, but a trend of progress toward other than the strength objective
indicates some change in the training content or routine is needed.

Conclusion
CONCLUSION
As you embark on a strength training program with the goal of achieving
more swimming speed, please keep this thought in your mind. To become
a fast swimmer, you have to be prepared to sow before you reap. Swimming
is a sport that takes a lot of dedication over time. Day after day, you have
to believe that all your training will pay off. Month after month, you have to
have faith that you are developing in the right direction. Year after year, you
have to trust that your ultimate swimming goal will be realized.
In this age of immediate gratification, swimmers have to be so patient! So,
as you catch the next medicine ball, or make your way around the next
circuit, take pride in your dedication and enjoy the process of moving
toward your goal.
