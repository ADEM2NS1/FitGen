For my daughters, Elena and Emilia
Special Shoutout to all the coaches who I've worked with over the years, who have inspired many of the sets in here.
Kyle, Dave, Erica, Dave, Justin, Rocky, Rick, here's to you.

Welcome to Elite Swimming Workout 2019-2020!
Before we get started, just brief note about myself. Ive been swimming now for 25 years, and although I am
officially retired from competition, it's something that's truly engrained into who I am. Through the years, I have
practiced with all types of people and teams. Ive trained and competed against Olympians and gold medalists,
and cut my teeth against some of the fastest swimmers on the planet.
As a teenager, I was a full-on distance swimmer, winning state championships in the 1650. I eventually moved
over to mid-D, setting multiple school records in events like 500 and 200, all while maintaining a healthy love of
sprints. In college, I transitioned to full time sprinting, breaking numerous school records, and eventually
becoming the Division 1, 50 freestyle Horizon league champion, setting the 50 record for the meet (which was then
broken again soon after
).
After graduating from Milwaukee in 2012, I took a short break, before getting back into it and competing again
at the US Open in 2013.
Swimming is a hard sport, there is no getting around that. Part of the difficulty is the amount of time that needs
to be invested to keep up with ones training. After starting a family, I found it was quite difficult to find the time to
make it to Masters workouts, which led me to train quite a bit by myself. Thats where this book comes in.
The resources out there seem to be very limited when it comes to workouts for top tier athletes, especially if
you are swimming with no coach. Most training regimes you find online feel quite random and it can be quite
difficult to find an Olympic-level workout for the seasoned swimmer.
That being said, this doesn't have to be for an Olympic-caliber athlete. If you find the times are too fast, use the
slower interval listed on the sheet. If its still too little, the intervals can easily be adjusted by adding 10-20 seconds
per set.
All in all, what you'll find here is a season's worth of workouts, for the motivated athlete. Each has been custom
crafted to fit a specific mold, and they are all reminiscent of the top-tier workouts I experienced throughout my
college career.
Each training session is designed for a specific day for the 2019-2020 college season, and maintains a single day
off per week (Sunday).
Hope you enjoy!

After the
warmup, Pick
ONE category
that best fits
your expertise.
This is your
main set

Equipment needed:
Clock: Intervals will be tough to make without keeping track of time
Swimsuit: Public swim pools seem to frown on nude workouts.
Drag-suit: I swore by one. Slows you down by a small amount. Drag-suit comes off when its time to
get serious.
Cap: Keeps your loose hair out of the pool.
Water Bottle w/water: Hydro homies stick together. Hydration is key.
Board: Everyone's favorite mid-workout surfboard. Used for kicking sets. And there'll be lots of 'em!
Fins: Get a size that fits, and that won't fall off when you kick hard or do flip turns. I prefer the longer
ones over the short and stunt fins.
Paddles: Expands the size of your hands, to work on your pull. Get a size that works for your hand, I
wouldn't recommend going overboard with the monster sized ones.
Buoy: To put in between your legs and to stop kicking, and for rotations. Bread and butter of swim
workouts.
Chutes: Strap it to your waist and significantly increase the resistance you feel in the water. Must have
for sprinters.
Med Balls: Like a basketball, but heavy. Provides just the right medicine you need to get your muscles
in shape.
*All the of the workouts are designed for a standard 25 Yard pool
