Swimming- A Training Program

PRELUDE
PRELUDE
Our first book, "Swim to the Top" included a prelude that described the
background and experience of Coach David Wright. In “Swimming – A Training
Program" he expands on this with a short story on swimming from the days of
his youth.
TO SWIM IN THE POOL OF A GOD
Not many people have been to Te Reinga. It's on the inland road between
Wairoa and Gisborne. The main road runs along the coast and has lots of fast
cars. The inland road wriggles up valleys with names like Ruakaturi and along a
river called Hangaroa and around a mountain called Whakapunaki. And where
the Ruakaturi and the Hangaroa meet and right below Whakapunaki, that's Te
Reinga.
It is maybe a dozen homes, an abandoned trucking business, a three-room
school and a marae. But most important it has the Te Reinga Falls and it is the
home of Hinekorako, the only female God of the Maori.
In 1350 the last of the great waka from eastern Polynesia, Takitimu made
landfall on the coast, east of Te Reinga, at Mahia. The purpose of the expedition
was to introduce the sacred lore of Hawaiki to Aotearoa. Atua or deities had
been captured in wood and stone and were brought to Aotearoa in the waka.
One of the atua was Hinekorako. Initially she lived with her people on the
marae at Te Reinga. She married and agreed to become a mother on the
condition that her husband would always tend to the baby. This was not work for
a god. One day during an important meeting of marae elders, he refused and
Hinekorako left him and dived into the falls and lives in the cave beneath them
to this day.
This might seem like the dull and dusty remnants of myth and fable, but to me it
was once very important. You see I was raised in Te Reinga and I was obsessed
with swimming. These were the days when O'Brien and Berry from Australia
and Scholander from the United States were winning the Olympic Games and
Chapman, Shripston and Whittelston represented New Zealand. Cook Strait

was still waiting to be swum and Hawke's Bay boasted New Zealand's best
swimmers, Palmer, Christie, Meade, Todd and Coutts. I trained in the river just
above the Te Reinga falls and raced my mates across its thirty meters. Winning
depended on how quickly you could get your feet out of the mud at the start. If
only they had needed that skill at Mexico City.
Just as important, many years earlier as Hinekorako left the marae for the last
time, she said no male would be a warrior unless he could swim the full length
of the narrow channel below the Te Reinga Falls and climb the rock to her cave
home. This was difficult, the wide river above the falls narrowed to a rapid ten-
meter wide, one hundred and fifty meter long torrent below the falls. Swimming
against the current was only the first problem. It was then necessary to swim
under the huge volume of falling water and climb the rock. The return journey
didn't appear too tough, slide down the rock and rest as the current carried you
along the narrow channel and out into the big lake at the end.
As the years went by I swam for Hawke's Bay and won the Auckland and
Wellington Winter Swimming Championships. I was second to the New Zealand
Champion twice across Lake Taupo, and had won the popular Lake Wiritoa
swim. But I had never swum the Te Reinga Falls. Worse, I had looked at it
several times and had determined before getting near the water that the swim
was impossible. Twice I got into the water but gave up as I felt the pressure of
the current and saw the blackness of its depth.
And then in the summer of 1968 I flew to Australia and trained with Don Talbot.
I swam with and talked to his Olympic Champions and world record holders.
The distances we swam were modest by today's standards but for me they were
immense. Back in Te Reinga I looked again at the Te Reinga Falls. Surely now I
could meet Hinekorako's challenge. I was lucky, 1968 had been a dry summer
and the volume of water was lower than normal – perhaps, tomorrow.
Donald came with me and we climbed down the bush path to the end of the
channel. We sat for a while on the rock ledge and discussed strategy. Goggles
were a new thing in those days and I would wear them. I would swim on the left
because a rock at the top of the channel made the current weaker on that side. I
got into the water and wondered why swiftly flowing water always seemed
colder than gentle currents. Like wind, does water have a chill factor?
Swimming- A Training Program

The first portion of the swim was remarkably easy. I could see the stone bank
passing by quite quickly and the effort was not great. Donald had told me to
watch for the rock that broke the current but I forgot and swam into it. The
current on the other side was much faster. Now it was hard work. But you know
how in a race there sometimes is a moment when the brain says,” I'm going to
do this." Well that's what it was like at Te Reinga. I reached the edge of the
falling water and swam in underneath. The weight of water was similar to a
breaking wave and pushed me under. It did not take long though and I was on
the other side, behind the veil of a God. The climb to the cave was easy and
soon I sat on the doorstep of Hinekorako's home.
Now, do you want to know two really silly things?
Hinekorako said, you became α warrior
completing that swim and just for a couple of
minutes, sitting behind the waterfall, she was
right. And second, ever so occasionally when I
see Thorpe or Klim or Huegill or Hackett
breaking a world record or winning a world title, I
hear a little voice asking, "Ah, but could they
swim the Te Reinga Falls?"

INTRODUCTION
INTRODUCTION
HOW TO USE THE BOOK AND ITS SCHEDULES
Our first book “Swim to the Top” describes how Lydiard's system of training can
be applied successfully to competitive swimming. It is a general book that
addresses the principles of the swimming program. It does not however detail
the schedules involved in putting Lydiard's principles into practice. This second
book, "Swimming – A Training Program” takes the next step. It sets out the 300
swimming schedules and 115 weight schedules making up a single six-month
training cycle.
To be most effective “Swimming
A Training Program" should be read in
association with "Swim to the Top". One provides the training practice and the
other the training theory. However, for readers who have not been able to access
a copy of "Swim to the Top" each chapter in "Swimming – A Training Program"
begins with a summary of the theory supporting the schedules that follow. Each
week's program, which in most cases involves thirteen swimming schedules and
five weight schedules, also includes a description of how the week's program is
compatible with and contributes to Lydiard's training objectives.
There is no reason why experienced swimmers cannot follow the schedules
exactly as they are included in the book. A better way, however, is to look at
what each schedule is trying to achieve and how it does it, and then swim either
the schedule suggested or some modified version that better suits the swimmer.
Before making a change, make sure the principle behind the schedule is not
being compromised. Turning a long aerobic conditioning workout into a series
of 25m sprints or a kick session into a medley workout will upset the balance of
the recommended program and the swimmer's final result.
Don't use the schedules like one coach who rang me and said he wanted a
"Lydiard training session." I asked him why he wanted just one session. Training
programs do not work that way. Each session needs to relate to every other
session so that the season forms an integrated whole. Wednesday's training
needs to take into account the training done on Tuesday and planned for
Thursday. Week Five's training needs to take into account the training done in
INTRODUCTION
11
Week Four and planned for Week Six. Each individual session needs to reflect
and assist in achieving the season's main competitive goal. He told me that all
the different training ideas were confusing him, so he had decided he would get
a Lydiard type schedule from me for Monday's training, an interval session from
a specialist interval coach for Tuesday and so on through the week. His squad
would be getting a balanced portion of everybody's ideas – it just had to work. I
couldn't believe it so I just gave him Week Five's Saturday morning Waitakeres
session. All that was a couple of years ago now and I haven't heard of a host of
champions coming from his squad, so I guess his idea of a balanced program
needs to be reviewed.
The next few chapters address the training schedules involved in each of the
race preparation stages of a Lydiard program. For example the next chapter
covers the Aerobic Build-up period: the following chapter, the Transition period,
then the Anaerobic Conditioning period and finally, the Trials and Coordination
period. The table below shows the number of swimming and weight training
schedules included in "Swimming
A Training Program" for each of these
periods.

YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Less experienced swimmers, not yet able to handle the full Lydiard program, will
need to modify the schedules to bring them down to a volume that they can
Swimming- A Training Program
12
manage. How this is best done will depend on whether swimmers are less
experienced because they are young athletes just setting out on their senior
competitive careers or recreational swimmers who use swimming as part of their
fitness program or triathletes who have to allocate training time to three
disciplines or surf swimmers using pool work to prepare for their specialist sport.
The demands and requirements of each category are very different. To assist in
adapting the competitive pool schedules in this book, I have included
suggestions at the end of each week's training notes on how they can be
modified for younger swimmers, recreational swimmers and triathletes. For
example, should the number of repetitions or the length of each repetition be
reduced. The answer is you can usually do either, but the notes will give you
guidance.

mr Sessions whose main purpose is to aid recovery from the week's harder
swims. None of this swimming should be hard and is broken up to include
a mixture of kicking, swimming, pull and drills.
k
Sessions where the emphasis is on kick sets. In a 7.5km session up to 4km
is done as kick with fins.
m
These are key sessions of long, firm aerobic swimming. In a 10km session
2km should be warm-up, 2km should be warm-down and 6km should be
firm aerobic swimming of repetitions between 500m and 3000m.
hl
"Hill” sessions of 25m repeats with 25m easy between for technique
development. Swimmers must not sprint this session. Good technique is the
session's purpose.
w
“Waitakeres” usually 100x100m or similar. The session has the same
aerobic conditioning purpose as the long sessions.
Note
The recomended weight program involves twenty-four seperate exercises
divided into four groups of six exercises. The swimmer starts with Session One
and works through to Session Four before returning to Session One again. This
allows four or five days rest between repititions of the same group of exercises
an important factor in improving strength and avoiding weight training injuries.

THE BUILD-UP SCHEDULES
23
NOTES TO WEEK ONE SCHEDULES
Several schedules in the build-up, such as those on Monday, Friday and Sunday
are recovery sessions where the good is in the mileage swum, mileage for
mileage's sake. That's not a politically correct thing to say about a training
program. Today everything has to have more meaning than that. Well in this
case, there is nothing wrong with clocking up kilometers just for the aerobic
benefit kilometers provide. Swimmers used to a seven days per week distance
conditioning program find these days aid
recovery more than a day off. After a day off,
swimmers start the following day stiff and sore.
Their muscles are still feeling the effects of the
long taxing swims. It takes them a further day
of swimming just to loosen up again.
Too Much catch-up
Nicole demonstrates a typical catch-up stroke
where the recovery arm catches up with the
pulling arm. I prefer the 180 degree alternating
stroke.
180 apart
Nicole demonstrates the 180 degree
alternating stroke. This is the freestyle I prefer.
The key 10km "long" sessions are swum on
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. They are the
swimming equivalent of Lydiard's long two-
hour runs. The main sets should be timed and
the times recorded to be compared with the
same main sets when they are swum again in the second five weeks of the
build-up. Remember, although the sets are timed, they must be swum
aerobically. Going anaerobic may produce impressive training times but
contributes little to the aerobic objectives of the build-up.
Swimming- A Training Program
24
Saturday morning's training is the week's third 10km “long” session and in
recognition of its Lydiard origins is called the Waitakeres. This was the range of
hills in the west of Auckland where each week Lydiard tested his runners over a
rugged 22-mile circuit. Every Saturday's “Waitakeres” session is based around
100m repetitions that culminate in Weeks Five and Nine with 100x100m with a
15 seconds interval. The length of the rest is based on research done on runners
in Finland that established a rest of 15 seconds or less did not affect the aerobic
nature of the session. It avoids the 100x100m becoming a session of hard
anaerobic repetitions. 100x100m done this way
is physiologically the same as a 10km straight
swim.
Hand Paddles
α
Nicole demonstrates the use of hand paddles
useful tool for improving swimmers arm strength
and correcting some faults such as slipping.
Kicking
Nicole finishes another length kick. Spend time
on conditioning a swimmer's kick. If a swimmer's
kick fails, the rest of the stroke will soon follow.
Saturday afternoon's session is important because
it sets aside time specifically for stroke correction.
Stroke correction should be part of every training
session. When faults are detected they should be
corrected irrespective of whether stroke correction is mentioned in the schedule.
Nevertheless it is good to set aside one session each week when time is specifically
allocated to stroke correction. It means once a week both coach and swimmers
are obliged to specifically address the question of technique. It should ensure
faults do not carry on by default.
THE BUILD-UP SCHEDULES
25
Don't correct stroke characteristics just because they look odd. Evaluate whether
what looks like a fault actually matters. Frequently some quite odd-looking
things don't affect the swimmer's efficiency – if the swimmer feels comfortable
swimming that way, leave it alone. One of my best sprinters, Nichola
Chellingworth, had a strange kink in her wrist when she recovered her left arm
swimming freestyle, but her hand entered the water normally. The only reason
for changing it would have been to avoid having to constantly respond to well
meaning onlookers asking, "Why does Nichola have that strange kink in her
wrist?" Evaluate what is a stroke fault and what is just a stroke idiosyncrasy and
correct the faults.
Sunday's single swimming session includes two sets of 20x50m, which at first
may appear quite contrary to Lydiard's principles of build-up conditioning.
However, they are included as an extension of Saturday's stroke correction
tuition. Swimming these 50m slowly provides an opportunity to drill Saturday's
technique lesson.
This week sees the first weight training
sessions of the new season. Be cautious
about the amount of weight lifted. The
purpose of weight training at this stage is
just to get the body back into weight
training condition. There is plenty of time
to load up the weights. Doing so too early
could cause injury and will almost certainly
leave the swimmer unnecessarily stiff and
sore. To start with, lift weights the swimmer
feels are too light. Even then swimmers
may be a little stiff from the early sessions.
The happy thought is that this will
probably get worse for two or three days
before muscles adjust to the new season's
training. A little stiffness should not be
used as a reason for missing training.
Annie and Fara
Annie and Fara complete an eight
kilometer sea swim. These events are
terrific conditioning for pool swimmers
Swimming- A Training Program
26
Each weight exercise should be done as three sets of seven repetitions with the
exception of sit-ups, which should be done as a single set of 500. I arrived at
seven repetitions after experimenting for several years with repetitions of
between three and twenty. The number that contributes most to the swimmer's
strength is seven. Fewer repetitions than this generate good strength gains, but
produce too much muscle bulk. More than seven repetitions and the weight
lifted needs to be reduced with corresponding lower strength gains.
Sunday's weight training session is the beginning of the second cycle of weights.
Swimmers can now increase the weights lifted by increasing each exercise by
one weight increment. For example, in our local gym the dumb bells increase in
weight in two-kilogram increments. If a swimmer has done flies with 24
kilograms in cycle one, I would increase this to 26 kilograms in cycle two. For
those exercises involving machine weights, our gym's machines increase their
weights in seven-kilogram increments. A swimmer lifting 42 kilograms in cycle
one should aim to lift 49 kilograms in cycle two.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
A full Lydiard program is not intended for junior pre-teen swimmers setting out
on their swimming career. At this stage swimming should be only one of a range
of activities. Swimming the schedules in this book allows time for sleep and
school or part-time work but can not accommodate anything like the diversity
that should be part of a young pre-teen's life. Children should be allowed the
time to be children. Their lives should be full of diverse and interesting activity. If,
however, a swimming career based on a Lydiard training program becomes an
athlete's thing, it will be done better looking back on an early childhood that
involved lots of other interests. It's a choice between an athlete who thinks," The
only thing I've ever done is swim.” or, “I tried heaps of things but the one I liked
best was swimming." It's fairly certain which will give the best result.
