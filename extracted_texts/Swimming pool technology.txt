DULCODOS® Pool Swimming Pool Metering Systems
DULCODOS® Pool Swimming Pool Metering Systems
The metering systems DULCODOS® Pool ensure the best water quality. The systems are available
in four different designs. It is easy to work out which type is best suited to your requirements.
Chlorine or active oxygen?
Historically, swimming pool water has always been treated with chlorine. Because it is an effective
disinfectant and is highly oxidising, chlorine is also the chemical of choice for public pools. Clear and
hygienically safe water is guaranteed.
The metering systems DULCODOS® Pool reliably keep the operating parameters in an optimum range and
unpleasant side-effects, such as the smell of chlorine or burning eyes, are very rare.
Active oxygen is less effective than chlorine. It can be used for very gentle and environmentally-sound
water treatment in pools with fewer users.
■ Soft
DULCODOS® Pool Soft is especially suited to private pools used by a small number of people. It works with
active oxygen substances, which are less effective than chlorine. Water treatment with active oxygen is a
good alternative for ecologically-minded pool owners or if users are allergic to chlorine. DULCODOS® Pool
Soft uses no chlorine chemicals.
■ Basic
DULCODOS® Pool Basic regulates the pH and chlorine content using the redox potential. This is the direct
measurement of effective oxidation in the water and is therefore an indication of the disinfectant effect and
concentration of the metered chlorine. The concentration of chlorine cannot be determined with accuracy
with this process. ORP measurements allow a particular range of chlorine to be set. DULCODOS® Pool
Basic is robust and requires little maintenance.
■ Comfort
DULCODOS®Pool Comfort uses highly specific chlorine sensors to measure the chlorine content. The
concentration of chlorine in the water can be determined and set with accuracy. The effectiveness of the
pool filter is boosted by an integrated feeder assembly for flocculant, resulting in crystal-clear water!
Numerous features to enhance operating convenience, such as measured values being mapped by a
screen plotter or remote control from your PC, iPad or other tablet device using an integrated web server,
make the metering system very popular with customers.
■ Professional
In addition to the features described above, DULCODOS®Pool Professional also measures the combined
chlorine. This is an important parameter in public pools. It can be incorporated in the building management
system via OPC and KNX and alarm messages can be sent by text or e-mail. Eco!Mode operating mode
reduces the energy consumption of the filter pumps. The integrated soft PLC control can be used to operate
several peripheral devices and functions. The swimming pool controller becomes the central control unit
for all the swimming pool technology.

DULCODOS® Pool Swimming Pool Metering Systems
Choice of pumps
The metering systems DULCODOS®Pool allow you to choose which metering pump to fit on your complete
system. The choice of pump depends entirely on the size of your pool and how often it is used.
■ Peristaltic pumps DULCO®flex are suited to applications requiring few chemicals, such as small
pools or those used infrequently. The pump reliably eliminates bubbles of gas formed during periods of
non-use. Depending on the amount of use, the metering hose has to be replaced once or twice a year.
■ Motor-driven metering pumps alpha have a higher capacity and longer maintenance intervals. Like
peristaltic pumps, they are silent.
■ Solenoid metering pumps Beta® are not controlled by switching them on and off, like DULCO®flex or
alpha, instead, their metering frequency is adjusted continuously, enabling the pump to have an
extremely precise control action.
■ Pumps with CAN bus systemcan be used in the DULCODOS® Pool Professional series. They
communicate all operating messages, such as two-stage monitoring of the chemical reservoir, to the
control.
■Accessories
Whether you are looking for collecting pans for chemical tanks or portable test devices for measurement
parameters - or even software for digital control: optional accessories make it even easier for you to
operate the system.
Service
Installation, commissioning, training in how the system works, operation and maintenance: When you buy
a DULCODOS®Pool system, it comes with service you can rely on – even if your pool is already quite old.

automatically and correctly.
For swimming pools with volumes up to 100 m³
Chlorine-free water treatment system for environmentally operated private pools. Safe water disinfection
with active oxygen as a turnkey complete solution.
Complete system DULCODOS® Pool Soft for pH adjustment and chlorine-free disinfection with active

continuously, but injected at intervals controlled by a timer.
Peristaltic pumps of the product range DULCO®flex, motor-driven metering pumps type alpha or solenoid
metering pumps type Beta® are used, depending on demand and the circulation volume.
Sensors, controllers and metering pumps form a unit with the chemical storage tanks, which can get to work
without a lot of installation effort on your part.
The control device performs numerous functions to enhance operating convenience, such as mapping
measured values using a screen plotter and an SD memory card or remote access via the integral WEB
server and LAN interface (optional).
