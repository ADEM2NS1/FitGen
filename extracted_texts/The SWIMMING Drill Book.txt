Foreword
A special note for coaches from Coach Kirk Johansen.
A few years ago, I attended a coaching conference where one of the speak-
ers was the late, great Cecil Colwin, the legendary swim coach from Canada
who wrote Swimming Into The 21st Century. One of the points that Cecil made
is that we, as coaches, need to strive to reach a level of "intuitive coaching."
He described this kind of coaching as having such a solid foundation of
stroke technique drills and teaching skills that we can adjust each individual
swimmer's stroke technique to help him or her become more efficient and
effective. Only by having a strong foundation in the fundamentals can we
then “make things up" and be creative enough to modify a swimmer's stroke
so that she or he achieves a personal best performance.
I have been a coach and teacher for many years, and I have learned that we
as coaches are always teaching. For us to evolve as teachers, we need to learn
and grow constantly. We always have to practice teaching the fundamentals
that are presented in this book. And then, with practice and repetition, as with
anything else, we can take these fundamental drills and stretch them to fit
the needs of our swimmers. This is the art of coaching—intuitive coaching.
It's no accident that Cecil Colwin endorsed the first edition of this book.
My invitation to coaches at any level is to use this book as I have—to master
the teaching of these drills as appropriate for your group of swimmers.
Then, observe your swimmers carefully and be prepared to change. Be
open to making continual adjustments in how you teach. Remember, the
swimmers are merely a reflection of your teaching and coaching. Don't be
afraid to be different and to experiment. That approach is precisely how this
book came together—because Ruben is an innovator and has observed and
experimented with teaching his swimmers for many years. Having known
Ruben for over 25 years, I have seen that his teams were clearly well coached.
His swimmers had excellent stroke technique and executed their races with
precision. This book will help you do the same with your swimmers.
Most important, have fun!

Preface
In the past several years, since the writing of Swimming Drills for Every
Stroke, exciting new developments have occurred in the understanding of
how the body can move more efficiently and fluidly through the water.
Research continues to show that the most significant factors in improved
performance are technical efficiency of strokes, starts, and turns—rather
than physical conditioning. The Swimming Drill Book incorporates those
developments into a refined series of drills that have produced excellent
results. In addition, the language of communicating these new concepts and
skills to both age-group and senior-level swimmers has been fine-tuned so
that swimmers get it almost right away.
The book begins with a chapter on body position and buoyancy. Most of
these concepts were derived from Dr. Bill Boomer, the U.S. Olympic swim-
ming team guru. By simplifying the drills and developing a specific sequence
of practicing the drills in daily workouts, swimmers have improved in effi-
ciency from 25 to 40 percent.
A chapter on breathing and kicking and one on sculling will prepare
swimmers for the chapters on the individual strokes. A new concept in the
book concerns the body angle while swimming backstroke and freestyle.
By using the sciences of physics and kinesiology, I have tested stroke effi-
ciency to show that the optimal level of rotation is not 90 degrees, a popular
notion, but approximately 45 degrees. The physics of the human body and
its buoyancy are analogous to that of a sailboat, prompting the concept of
the "sailboat angle" of rotation. From the kinesiological perspective, this
concept is consistent with producing maximum muscular power through-
out the entire stroke cycle.
Improving in the pool isn't only about body position, breathing and kick-
ing, and the strokes. Quick starts, turns, and finishes are also important to
the success of the swimmer. Three chapters provide an array of drills for
every type of start, turn, and finish. Additionally, the new final chapter
incorporates strength training drills done outside of the pool to enhance
swimmers' performance. This training complements work done in the pool
and enables athletes and coaches to work on improving fitness along with
swimming skills.
Coaches and swimmers at all levels can use this book to increase practice
effectiveness, improve competitive times, and enhance fitness.

Introduction
Swimming requires a combination of physical strength and technical
finesse. Because water is foreign to humans, the technical aspects of moving
through it become critical at the competitive level. Most swimmers who
participate in the sport are relatively inexperienced in proper technique.
For them, progress is dramatic when their technique improves. But even
for the most experienced swimmer, small technical improvements can
make the difference between qualifying and not qualifying for nationals
or Olympic trials.
This book covers the fundamentals needed for competitive swimming.
All the essential drills are presented to ensure that a swimmer is compe-
tent in the basics of competitive swimming. Mastering the basics builds the
foundation of future development and refinement.
Swimmers need to have a planned approach to developing good technique
that is simple to learn, proven, and tested. Swimmers who use this book will
benefit by learning effective ways to practice the skills of swimming. They
will perform better and swim faster in competition. They are more likely to
stay interested in swimming and will therefore enjoy the sport more.
Coaches need to have a well-planned, comprehensive curriculum. They
also need a system that is flexible and can be adapted to a variety of situa-
tions. This book will help coaches by providing an organized approach to
stroke instruction. By using this system, they can communicate the course
outline more effectively in advance, thereby gaining support from swim-
mers and parents. After a coach becomes skilled in using these drills, he or
she can easily detect and correct stroke deficiencies, helping the athletes
become faster and better swimmers.
Let's say you have 16 weeks to prepare for a major competition. A good
way to organize instruction is to divide drill training into three sections.
Spend the first 9 weeks teaching the drills presented in this book in chap-
ters 1 through 7 and 9 in sequential order. Cover one chapter per week.
Next, over the following 4 weeks, repeat the drills in chapters 3 through 6
to polish and correct technique. To warm up, spend 3 weeks focusing on
starts, turns, and finishes (chapters 9 through 11), along with brushing up
any major stroke deficiencies.

After you have your overall 16-week plan in place, organize each week
like this:
Day 1: Introduce the first two or three drills and practice them.
Day 2: Review the drills learned the previous day and then introduce
three or four more and practice them.
Day 3: Review all the drills previously learned and introduce the final set
of drills and practice them.
Day 4 and 5: Review all key drills in a progression.
Do your normal warm-up routine, but include at least one key drill learned
the previous day. After you have covered the entire system, a key drill from
each stroke can become part of the warm-up. Each week, change the key drill.
Your swimmers should memorize the key drills and preform them weekly.
To introduce and teach each drill, follow these steps:
• Explain: Provide a complete description of how the drill is performed.
• Demonstrate: Show how the drill is performed by using the diagrams
or demonstrate the drill yourself. (With younger swimmers, a helpful
approach is to use a swimmer of the same age who is proficient in the
drill to demonstrate.)
• Correct: Have swimmers perform the drill after your initial explana-
tion and demonstration. Point out what they have done correctly. Next,
focus on one point at a time. Correct any errors until the swimmers do
the drill properly.
• Repeat: After the swimmers can perform the drill correctly, have them
repeat it until the drill becomes a habit. Make sure that the swimmers
do not develop improper techniques.
Running practices that focus on stoke technique requires a commitment
to improve. Many coaches rarely focus on technique during their practices
because they believe it can take away from "training." But when a swim-
mer has developed bad habits of poor stroke technique, improving those
deficiencies can be very difficult. Slowing down and giving the swimmers
an opportunity to practice these drills through repetition and correction
will vastly improve their efficiently. In my practices, we dedicate part of
the warm-up and at least one set strictly to drill work. We are constantly
practicing and reinforcing the skills in this book to continue our efforts to
improve. I try to correct stroke deficiencies quickly to prevent my swimmers
from developing any bad habits.
Coaches, your job is not an easy one, and the rewards come all too slowly.
I hope that this material makes your job easier and more enjoyable.
Swimmers, my hope is that you enjoy performing these drills. You likely
have much to learn about swimming. Learn it a little at a time. I hope that
this book helps you master all the important skills and helps you swim
easier and faster.

Chapter 1
Body Position
and Buoyancy
Water is not a natural environment for humans. To move through the water, you
must learn to relax and allow the water to support your natural buoyancy—
that is, your ability to float. Positioning the body for maximum buoyancy with
minimum effort is fundamental to swimming faster.
One of the keys to improving body position and buoyancy is understand-
ing that head position often dictates the ease with which the rest of the body
moves through the water. Because of the dense weight of the head, slight
changes in its position can significantly alter the position of the trunk and
legs. If the head is too high, there is increased drag through the torso and
the kick is much less effective. If the head is too low, drag increases as well.
The goal is to create a connected body line from the head through the spine.
The drills in this chapter will
• enable you to feel how your body is positioned in the water,
• improve your ability to relax and allow your body to be supported by
the water,
• improve your ability to move through the water with less effort, and
• improve your efficiency in swimming all the strokes.
You can improve your strokes almost instantly by learning how to relax
and control your body position. Although these drills are simple, they pro-
vide a transformational foundation for how you experience your body in
the water and for improved performance. Even experienced swimmers gain
tremendous improvement in their efficiency by practicing these drills. In
my experience coaching swimmers in my stroke clinics, these drills alone
can improve efficiency (measured by strokes per lap) by 25 to 40 percent
on average. Whether you are a beginner or an international-level swimmer,
these drills are fundamental to your success.

1 HEAD AND BODY POSITION
Purpose
To help you experience the different sections of your body and to learn the
importance of head position.
Procedure
1. Stand on deck with your back to a wall that is taller than you.
2. Place your heels against the wall.
3. Push your hips against the wall.
4. Tuck your chin in and place your shoulder blades against the wall.
5. Gently move your head back until it is touching the wall. You should
now have four contact points: heels, hips, shoulder blades, and back of
head.
6. Take a small step away from the wall and try to maintain the same
posture.
7. Step back against the wall to see whether you were successful.
