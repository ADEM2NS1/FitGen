Always maintain balance and stability during the power phase. Always return to the starting position gently and with less speed.

Because the six stages of development identified earlier in this book are not isolated but are more of a continuum, merging one into the next, the routines and circuits are presented in four progressive levels with specific content to meet particular developmental objectives. Use these routines and circuits as examples for structure and content, then tailor them to the needs of the individual swimmer. Check with your health care provider before starting a strength training program. STRENGTH TRAINING ROUTINES The following routines are presented in a sequence beginning with a warm-up and ending with a cool down. When a double space appears, extra rest should be taken. 107 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 107 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 110 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming LEVEL 1 ROUTINES These routines are appropriate for athletes at the elementary stage of development and older athletes at the beginning level. 108 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 108 12.07.11 12:13 --- OCR from Page 110 Image 1 --- fated ee 4 sane eeen ‘rrrreress ss aia a ae at a ott om Ms sce at taceaee fs oat\n",

      "training develop better endurance, as swimming, which builds endurance very well, becomes an extension of a “super workout” begun on land, requiring the swimmer to adapt to a greater workload. On the other hand, some believe that since swimming elongates the muscles, strength work that follows swimming ensures that the swimmer’s muscles are well warmed up and less vulnerable to injury from the demands of land training. They also argue that when strength training follows the water workout, the quality of the swimming is higher because a swimmer who is tired after strength training practices swimming slower, with less force, power and explosiveness, reinforcing undesirable habits. Finally, many take the position that swimming first allows the swimmer to feel and utilize the strength that he or she has adapted to in the water where it counts. So which is best? There are valid arguments for both. From the perspective of preparing a swimmer to race, to be ready to perform under less than ideal conditions, including poor weather, crowded warm-up areas and meet delays, a program that uses a bit of both approaches should be considered. By mixing it up, the swimmer will practice adapting to different situations. Further, changing the order of the training routine from time to time will keep it from becoming boring, as the swimmer will stay challenged to perform under different circumstances. The final decision should be based on what best works for the individual athlete. 99 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 99 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 102 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Scheduling rest time is as important as scheduling workout time.

Stretching has long been a traditional part of warming up before exercise, but the fact is, stretching has injured many swimmers. There are two reasons for this: 1. Stretching does not prepare the body to work, as a warm-up should do. By using valuable warm-up time for stretching, a swimmer runs out of time to do activities that raise the heart rate and activate the muscles. Beginning a workout in this state leaves the body more prone to injury. In addition, without a good warm-up, some or all of the workout is wasted because the swimmer is not prepared to exert. 2. In general, swimmers have very mobile joints, so stretching is really unnecessary. This is especially true of shoulder stretching. Because the shoulders are so central to swimming, they are commonly the site of soreness for many swimmers. In an effort to relieve soreness, we turn to stretching. But what happens when these muscles are stretched is that too much looseness develops, which can lead to joint stability problems during swimming, producing more soreness and pain. Instead of stretching as a warm-up, swimmers should spend warm-up time doing full-body activity with gradually progressive effort. As far as the shoulders, rather than stretching, the focus should be on stabilizing mobility at the joints to keep them operating correctly. This is done through specific shoulder stabilization exercises, as shown on page 94-95. If stretching is done at all, it should be done after exercise. It should be very conservative and target only the large muscles, not the joints. Even this kind of stretching should be gentle and gradual. Under no circumstances should any bouncing action be used.

      "Broken Arrow drill is designed for swimmers with tight shoulders and upper backs to help them loosen off. It’s a derivative of the 6-1-6 drill and should always be performed wearing fins. --- Page 297 Text --- As in 6-1-6, kick on the side but without delay take the top hand and raise it up vertically over your head and pause it there for two seconds. This is your ‘arrow’. After pausing for a second, break the arrow by bending at the elbow and then spear into the water in front of the head. Rotate on to the other side and breathe before returning your head to the water and lifting your arm on that side. The mantra of the drill is: up - break - spear in - breathe - up - break - speak in - breathe. Whilst your arm is vertical, think about sinking your arm down into the shoulder socket for two seconds before breaking the arrow. This helps you to improve your swimming posture by engaging your scapular. When you have a feel for the rhythm of Broken Arrow, maintain a focus on your lead hand, keeping it straight and aligned by drawing your shoulders back and together. --- Page 298 Text --- Using Broken Arrow You can swim Broken Arrow at any time but as with Shoulder Tap, it’s a perfect drill to add to your warm-up to help you loosen off your shoulders. A good warm-up is: 200 m easy freestyle 300 m with fins as 3x: {50 m Broken Arrow + 50 m freestyle} 100 m easy freestyle with pull buoy --- Page 299 Text --- Popov The Popov drill is used to develop your body rotation and a classic high elbow arm recovery.
