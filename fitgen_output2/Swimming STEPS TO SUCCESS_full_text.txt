Foreword
The world of swimming has been very good to me. Growing up in Winter Haven,
Florida, I was able to go from the kid who got cut from other sports to Olympic
champion. As a television commentator for swimming, I get to continue my pas-
sion for the sport that I love.
I have known Coach Scott Bay for many years, and we’ve had many great talks
about swimming: its history, its evolution, and, most important, the recent advances
in technique. We have worked together at several clinics, and we always have a great
exchange of ideas and observations. Coach Bay is truly a student of the sport.
In Swimming: Steps to Success, Coach Bay explains the elements of technique that
are part of good swimming. There will always be variations by elite swimmers, and
I encourage you to explore some of your own. This book can serve as a jumping-off
point where you can get sound advice on stroke technique and instruction.
So . . . whether you picked up this book out of curiosity or sought it out because
you want to see what swimming has to offer, you will enjoy Coach Bay’s detailed
instruction and continue your journey into the amazing world of fun, fitness, and
competition in swimming.
Best wishes to you on your journey!

Climbing the Steps
to Swimming
Success
Swimming has been practiced as both a sport and a recreational activity for thou-
sands of years. People at the highest levels of competition swim with such grace
and ease that it seems almost effortless. For a beginner or novice, on the other
hand, swimming may seem like an exhausting chore that can be done well only by
people who possess a natural talent for it. The truth, however, is that anyone can
learn to swim—and swim well. With this goal in mind, Swimming: Steps to Success
shows you how to feel more comfortable in an aquatic environment and takes you
through a progression of skills for each of the competitive strokes.
Step 1 starts with the basics—floating and finding your natural buoyancy. Step 2
addresses ways of manipulating the water for propulsion. Steps 3 through 6 cover
the fundamentals of the four competitive strokes—freestyle, backstroke, breast-
stroke, and butterfly. Steps 7 and 8 focus on turns and starts, and step 9 addresses
open-water and survival swimming. Step 10, the final step, gives you some guidance
for continuing your swimming journey.
The Steps to Success approach to swimming is systematic in building on a solid
foundation of skills and techniques. Each step should be approached in the following
manner:
1. Carefully read all material in the step.
2. Study the technique photos and, if necessary, use a mirror or a friendly
observer to duplicate them yourself.
3. Study the common errors that coaches look for so that you can avoid them!
4. When reading about and executing the drills, keep in mind that they are
often designed as “overcorrections” for a specific technique flaw. Drills are
intended to help you create a new pattern of movement. After completing
each drill, remember to score your success.
5. At the end of each step, review the key points in the Success Summary to
make sure that you understand the material. Then total your scores from the
drills in that step and make sure that you’ve achieved the needed level of
success before moving on to the next step.
As you make your way through the steps, you will begin to appreciate that swim-
ming is not so much about brute strength as it is about the timing and rhythm of your
movements. Getting it right takes a lot of thoughtful practice, and you will benefit
from revisiting the steps when you have trouble with a particular skill or technique.

Climbing the Steps to Swimming Success
Swimming is a journey, and this book is designed to help you work through that
journey one step at a time. Each step is laid out with a focus on a certain skills or
techniques and ways to increase or decrease the difficulty. If you have trouble with a
particular skill or step, remember that swimming consists of complex sets of move-
ments that are not part of any other athletic activity. Be patient with yourself; the key
is your progress. As with any journey, no matter how long or short, this one begins
with the first step.

The Sport of
Swimming
This book is a guide to help you better understand the fundamentals of swim-
ming, which can be defined simply as the act of propelling oneself through the
water. Because an instructional book cannot reasonably address all of the rules
and regulations applied to swimming, this introduction provides an overview of the
sport and introduces certain swimming terms commonly used by coaches and swim-
mers. Throughout the rest of the book, each term is further defined in the context in
which it is typically used.
The sport of swimming has been around for thousands of years, dating back at
least to 36 BCE, when Japanese people held organized swimming contests. From
then right up until today, it has been a very simple matter to determine the winner
of a swimming contest: whoever finishes first! Over the years, races have covered
a variety of distances, ranging from about 25 yards (23 m) to lengths that could be
measured in miles or kilometers.
Races can be further separated into disciplines, or strokes; they can also involve
medleys, in which various strokes are used, and team relay races. In modern swim-
ming, the strokes include freestyle (also known as the front crawl), backstroke, breast-
stroke, and butterfly. Modern rules dictate the specifics of format, but the essential
structure of each race is the same: a start, a swim, and a finish.
The AquATiC environmenT
Swimming differs from other sports in several ways. For one thing, swimming is not
necessarily a natural activity for human beings. Indeed, humans bear little resem-
blance to species that are geared to operate in an aquatic environment; for example,
fish don’t have necks. As a result, in order to swim, we humans must make some
adaptations—in part to accommodate our differences but also to take advantage of
them.
For success in swimming, you must first become comfortable in the aquatic envi-
ronment, which differs dramatically from the land-based environment in which we
typically operate on a daily basis. It is easier to do so if you understand the key dif-
ferences between humans and aquatic creatures. First, as mostly terrestrial creatures,
we walk upright, and our natural position for most of our waking hours is basically
vertical. In the water, however, most of what we do involves being horizontal, and
this difference takes some getting used to for most people.
In addition, in many sports, success depends largely on strength and speed.
In swimming, however, there is nothing solid to push against; therefore, though
strength does matter in swimming, it is much more important to apply pressure to
the water in the correct way. Because water is a fluid, it moves around you rather
xi

--- Page 13 Text ---
The Sport of Swimming
than resolutely resisting you in the way that a solid does. Similarly, speed in swim-
ming comes not necessarily from moving your body parts faster but from using your
movements to put pressure on the water in an effective manner. As anyone who has
participated in water aerobics can attest, you can work awfully hard in the water yet
go nowhere.
Swimming also changes the priorities typically placed on the human senses, as
well as the feedback they provide. On land, much of our typical interaction with our
environment revolves around the senses of sight and hearing. Underwater, however,
both of these senses are diminished and therefore often take a backseat to the sense
of touch, or “feel.”
Of course, one component of this sensory feedback involves water temperature,
which can greatly affect one’s comfort and enjoyment when swimming. In addition,
both very cold water and very hot water both pose health risks. Specifically, water
temperatures below 72 degrees Fahrenheit (about 22 degrees Celsius) or above 92
degrees Fahrenheit (about 33 degrees Celsius) require special caution because they
make for an uncomfortable learning environment.
Last—and this is perhaps the most striking difference between swimming and
other sports—one must purposefully address the question of when (and where) to
breathe. In most other sports, breathing happens without much conscious thought.
In swimming, however, breathing is often a primary focus because inhaling water
is not a pleasant experience. As a result, many swimmers feel that they must take a
big gulp of air and then hold their breath for as long as they can while swimming.
This approach typically leads to a bad experience, such as hyperventilating or even
concluding that swimming is just too hard and giving up altogether.
Each of these defining characteristics of swimming is discussed in greater detail in
the following chapters, which constitute a progression of steps to lead you to success!
Swimming venueS: PoolS
Swimming pools come in many sizes and shapes, and various configurations can
provide a great place to learn and train. Only certified pools are used in recognized
competitions, and they come in a variety of strictly measured distances. In the United
States, many age-group and college competitions take place in what are called short-
course yard (SCY) pools, which measure 25 yards (~23 m) in length. The United
States is the only country still competing in this type of pool, and other countries typ-
ically use short-course meter (SCM) pools, which measure 25 meters (~27 yd) (figure
1). Because meters are about 10 percent longer than yards, record times for meters
swims are longer than those done for yard swims.
Note that in this book, yards are used for pool dimensions. If you swim in a
pool measured in meters, you can use the same number given in the descriptions.
For example, if an instruction is to swim 25 yards, that can also be 25 meters.
Another type of competitive swimming venue is a long-course meter (LCM) pool,
which is often referred to as an Olympic-size pool. LCM pools are 50 meters (~55
yd) long, and though they may not look particularly long on Olympic television
broadcasts, the experience of swimming in them can be much different than that of
swimming in a short-course pool.
All of these competition pools share certain standard features, such as starting
blocks and—even more important, as discussed in step 4 of this book—a set of back-
stroke flags. These flags, or pennants, are strung across the pool’s lanes 5 yards or

meters from the edge of the pool to signal to backstroke swimmers that they are
approaching a wall—a crucial safety feature. Competition pools are also outfitted
with starting blocks, or platforms. In addition, during competitions, a thin sensor is
attached to the pool wall to record the time of each swimmer’s first touch rather than
relying on handheld timers.
Pool rACeS
The majority of swimming meets and races take place in pools (rather than in
open-water environments), and venues around the world host events featuring var-
ious strokes and distances on courses like those just described. Each national swim-
ming federation has its own minor rule variations, but the basic structure of a swim
race is always the same. All competitors start at the same time and adhere to the rules
of the prescribed stroke, and the finish order is ranked from fastest to slowest.
In events with more participants than lanes, the competition is conducted in mul-
tiple rounds or “heats.” Either heats are used to seed swimmers for the final, or heats
are pregrouped to put swimmers of similar speed in the same heat, and the best time
from any heat wins the race. These can be used to determine seeding for finals or
so that similar-speed swimmers all swim together, and the heats are timed with the
fastest swimmer being declared the winner. It has become easier to compare times
from different heats thanks to the development of sophisticated timing equipment,
standardized and certified pool lengths, and touch pads that automatically stop a
clock when a swimmer makes contact.

geTTing STArTed: APPArel
In order to learn the sport of swimming and train effectively for competition, you need
certain kinds of gear. For starters, choosing the right suit can be an important part of both
your appreciation of swimming and your comfort in the water. Many types of modern
swimsuit are available in different fabrics and cuts. Something that you might wear to
the beach is not necessarily the best choice for a swimming workout, since beachwear is
designed more for fashion than for function. Swimsuits, on the other hand, have evolved
to maximize fit and functionality.
Swimsuits
Unlike ancient swimmers, modern contestants are of course required to wear some sort of
swimsuit. Suit design has changed dramatically over the years, and today males typically
opt for a brief or “jammer,” which runs from waist to just above the knee. These formfitting
suits are typically made of a material that stretches, such as nylon, spandex, polyester, or a
combination thereof. Females typically wear a one-piece suit that covers the body from the
mid-thighs to the shoulders; suits vary in style and cut. For training purposes, swimmers
may opt to use any of a variety of suits that are less expensive or less restrictive or provide
some extra element for training purposes, such as the increased drag of looser suits.
Goggles
Goggles have been around for a long time but came into widespread use only in the 1970s;
they are now considered an integral part of sport swimming. For several reasons, goggles
come in many styles. How does one know which style to buy? Some styles are geared
toward a particular activity, such as scuba diving, snorkeling, or triathlon, and others are
available in different sizes, shapes, and tints.
Quality should be assessed on the basis not of price but of fit. The best goggles are the
ones that fit you—that is, the ones that fit your face comfortably and keep the water out.
Remember, their purpose is to enhance your vision and reduce eye irritation from pool
chemicals or, in open-water environments, other sources. To test the fit, place the eyepieces
on your eye sockets, below the bony part where the eyebrows are located, in the softer part
of each socket. Without using the strap, press the goggles gently onto this soft tissue and
see if they stay even for just a few seconds; if they do, you have a good fit! The strap merely
needs to hold the goggles in place, and of course it should not be made so tight as to injure
your eyes. The strap should fit above your ears and wrap near the top of the back of your
head (not at the base of your skull down near your neck).
Beyond these basics, goggle preference is an individual matter, much like the choice of
putter for a golfer. Considerations include one’s face shape and head size, as well as one’s
preference for a foam, silicone, or rubber gasket (or no gasket at all). The gasket is simply
the part of the goggle that contacts the face around the eye or the barrier between plastic
and your face. Choosing among these options is largely a matter of what works best for
you. Most sporting goods stores and swimming pro shops carry a variety of goggles, and
you can simply ask an associate for a demo model or for permission to open a package in
order to check the fit.
Caps
A swimmer with long hair often wears a cap for two reasons. First, of course, it keeps the
hair out of the way and reduces drag; second, it provides a measure of protection from
xiv

--- Page 16 Text ---
The Sport of Swimming
the sometimes-harsh chemicals or other environmental factors in the water. These
environmental factors can include the sun when outside, bacteria in the water, and
other chemicals in the water—such as a residual-like suntan lotion that came off
other swimmers, runoff from chemicals on the deck when it rains, or other chemicals
from pollution that can be found in open-water environments. Swim caps are made
often of latex, silicone, or (for very cold water) neoprene; they vary in style and price.
If you decide to wear a cap, take care to choose one that works for you. Cap sizing
tends to be one-size-fits-all, but small differences do exist from brand to brand. Keep
in mind that, like rubber bands, caps can stretch and break; they typically include a
care-and-use guide in their packaging.
geTTing STArTed: TrAining equiPmenT
In swimming, training equipment is often used to conduct drills and improve swim-
ming-specific movements by increasing resistance. It can also serve as an assistive
device that enables swimmers to isolate a specific movement or set of skills. Such
equipment is not necessary for the sport, but it can make many skills and drills easier
to master and perfect. At many facilities, equipment is made available to patrons,
thus enabling you to test out the gear and learn what to look for if you choose to pur-
chase your own. Common equipment used in swimming includes kickboards, fins,
paddles, pull buoys, and snorkels.
Kickboards
The kickboard (figure 2) is a fairly common piece of equipment found in many swim-
mers’ training bags. It is typically made of some sort of foam to provide flotation.
Its purpose is to provide a buoyancy assist so that swimmers can isolate and train the
kicking motion. It is often used to train all four competitive strokes.
Figure 2 Two different styles of kickboards.
xv

--- Page 17 Text ---
The Sport of Swimming
Fins
Fins are commonly used in swim training to add resistance to the kicking motion,
helping the person to swim more easily or to make the workout harder. They come in
a variety of shapes and sizes (figure 3), and some are designed specifically for a cer-
tain competitive stroke—for example, the monofin and the breaststroke fin. Monof-
ins are a training tool specific to dolphin kick. Breastroke fins are also very specific
to that kick and, due to the increase in pressure on the groin area and the inside of the
knee, should probably be used only under the supervision of a knowledgeable coach
and with a swimmer who has had sufficient technique training and the strength
to benefit from the extra resistance. For training purposes, fins with medium-size
blades work for most swimmers, though it is a good idea to use shorter blades in
the beginning in order to prevent injury. People who have less strength or flexibility
in the lower extremities—especially the ankles—should definitely use a medium or
shorter blade of 6 to 9 inches (about 15 to 23 centimeters) to prevent overstressing
those joints with the added pressure and resistance created by longer blades (often
seen in scuba shops). In addition, short-blade fins (shorter than 6 inches, or 15 cen-
timeters) are often used to work with just a little extra resistance while maintaining
kicking cadence and rhythm. As with goggles, fit is very important. A good fit is not
too tight or loose, and some swimmers prefer a sock as it makes the fin more comfort-
able. This is very similar to trying on shoes.
Figure 3 Fins of various lengths.
Paddles
Like goggles and fins, paddles for swimming come in a variety of shapes and sizes
(figure 4). Paddles are often used to create extra resistance by increasing the sur-
face area of the hands. As with fins, great care should be taken when using paddles
because the increased pressure on the water creates extra stress on the joints—in this
case the shoulders. As a result, novices should use smaller paddles in order to mini-
mize the risk of injury.

The Sport of Swimming
Figure 4 Paddles. Sizes and shapes vary widely depending on manufacturer and purpose.
Pull Buoys
A pull buoy (figure 5) is fitted between the thighs, just above the knees, and the
swimmer keeps it in place by squeezing the thighs together. This arrangement pre-
vents the swimmer from using any effective kick in the freestyle or backstroke, thus
isolating and training the pulling motion of the swimming arm stroke.
Figure 5 Pull bouys. Size and shape will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer.
Snorkel
The swimmer’s snorkel is a fairly recent development (figure 6). Of course, traditional
side-mounted snorkels have been around for years, but the newer center-mounted
snorkel is designed specifically for swim training. It allows swimmers to focus fully
on their strokes without the added concern of when and where to breathe.

for scuba diving, and they have a strap that goes around the head.
geTTing STArTed:
drillS And Their PurPoSe
Because body movements are controlled by the brain, the activity of swimming—an
unnatural activity for humans that requires complex, timed movements—requires us
to program the brain in order to direct the body effectively in the water. This process
is sometimes referred to as developing “muscle memory,” but it actually involves
brain imprinting and patterning. With this in mind, several drills are described for
each step in this book in order to imprint the relevant movement patterns on your
brain so that you can easily replicate them over and over again. One caveat: Some of
the drills imprint an overcorrection that will later be refined.
As mentioned earlier, swimmers often use training equipment to help them
acquire new skills or imprint new movement patterns. One must also take care, how-
ever, not to become dependent on that equipment for being able to move through the
water with skill and ease. In addition, your success depends on doing the drills and
using the equipment correctly rather than quickly. As with any learning, some swim-
mers progress faster than others, and each skill presents new a challenge. Therefore,
prepare yourself to be patient—swimming is a learned process that takes some time.
Swimming is one of the best sports in which to participate from a very young age
to a very old age. Some competitions even offer a 95-and-over age group! Athletes can
participate in this sport for such a long time—and at such advanced ages—because
of its low- to no-impact nature and the fact that it enables one to focus on technique
and effective movement. Science tells us that at a certain point in life we stop getting
stronger and gaining endurance; however, even though you may not be able to get
faster after a certain point, swimming always gives you a chance to get better.
Let’s move on now to the steps to swimming success, which enable you to learn
and practice skills that provide a solid foundation for lifelong enjoyment!

Step
1
Floating
The goal of this first step is to move from a vertical position to the horizontal
neutral position that serves as the platform for swimming in all four competitive
strokes. This step also helps you become comfortable in the water. By the end of
this step, you should be able to
• transition from vertical to floating on your back,
• transition from vertical to floating on your front,
• balance on your center of buoyancy in a streamlined position on your back,
and
• balance on your center of buoyancy in a streamlined position on your front.
The Physics oF Buoyancy and FloaTing
Floating is a skill, which means that anyone can do it if he or she learns how. As
humans, we float naturally, at least to some degree, because our lungs are filled with
air. In fact, our center of buoyancy is located approximately in the center of the chest,
at the sternum. Some other sports also require attention to one’s center of gravity, but
the priority in swimming, of course, is to find that center while moving through the
water.
You can imagine this center as the center of a teeter-totter or seesaw on a chil-
dren’s playground. When everything is in balance, the teeter-totter does not move.
Lift either end, however, and the opposite end goes down. With this analogy in mind,
you can start learning how to float on your back.
FloaTing on your Back
This section takes you from standing in a vertical position to simply floating on your
back. You need access to a pool with water deep enough to reach at least to your
waist but shallow enough that you can still stand in it. If needed, the action can also
be done from the side of a deep pool with a few modifications.
Back Floating With Arms Extended
The objective here is to lie back on the water with your arms and legs spread out for
balance, almost like a starfish, and float without movement (figure 1.1). Before you
1

--- Page 21 Text ---
Swimming: Steps to Success
try it, here are a couple of mental cues to help you quickly succeed. The first cue
addresses head position. Imagine having a dot on the top of your head that must
stay wet. Many swimmers are uncomfortable having the head so far in the water,
especially when water goes into the ears, but the water will come back out!
The second cue addresses body position. The goal is to keep your spine as elon-
gated and horizontal as possible. If you feel your feet sink, do not crunch with your
abs but rather push your navel to the top of the water. Some swimmers also find
it helpful to close their eyes in order to concentrate on how it feels to balance in
the water. Remember the teeter-totter—the minute you lift your head, your hips go
down.

correcTion
This problem results from arching the back too much. Keep your
spine straight and your limbs relaxed and out to the sides rather for
balance. Once you are able to do this successfully for at least a few
seconds, it is time to move on to more advanced floating skills.
Back Floating in a T Position
The next part of this progression involves taking away some of the surfaces that
swimmers use for balance. Repeat the same skill just described, but this time keep
your arms out while bringing your legs together, thus making a T rather than a star-
fish (figure 1.2). This action requires a little more control and ability to relax on the
water. Here again, the mental cue is that your face, chest, hips, and toes should all be
at the surface—only this time they should also all be in the same line along the axis
of your body.

Back Floating in a Straight Line
The last part of this progression involves bringing your hands in to the sides of your
body. As you become more comfortable with this balanced position, you can try a
more advanced floating technique. From your sides, bring your hands up above your
head, stretching to the longest possible position (figure 1.3). This is a more advanced
floating skill, and succeeding at it is a major accomplishment; in fact, some people
who have difficulty mastering it still go on to become very accomplished swimmers.
Once you have mastered these skills, it is time to practice them with modifications
and drills.

correcTion
Many people arch the back to push the torso up. Push the upper part
of the back down and rotate the pelvis up to bring the feet up to the
surface of the water. It may be helpful to visualize bringing the belly
button closer to the spine.
drills For PracTicing Back FloaTing
Just as basketball players don’t shoot one free throw and assume they have mastered
the skill, swimmers practice their techniques over and over—even the basic ones—to
keep their skills sharp. Once you feel comfortable that you are able to perform this
skill floating on the back, it is time to practice it without assistance from the bottom
of the pool. To practice going from vertical to horizontal, use the following series of
drills. They can be performed in deep water if you are comfortable in that environ-
ment and possess at least a beginning level of swimming skill. Otherwise, do them in
water no deeper than neck level.
Back-Floating Drill 1 Push-off on your Back
In this drill, you are positioned at the side of the pool, facing the wall, with both hands
on the gutter or deck. Your feet should be on the wall and your knees and toes point-
ing up toward the surface of the water. Lean your head back (looking up), release
your hands from the side of the pool, gently push off with your feet, and assume a
relaxed floating position.
For many swimmers, this drill requires more than one try. Here is the sequence
once again: lean head back, release hands, and gently push off with feet. You have
succeeded when you can do the drill repeatedly with your legs together and your
arms crossed. The purpose of this drill is to help you get skilled at and comfortable
with going from a semivertical position to a horizontal back float.
To increase diFFiculTy
• Push off harder.
To decrease diFFiculTy
• Have your coach or instructor hold your head to ensure that it stays
above the water.
• Keep your arms at your sides or out perpendicular to the body.
• Hold a kickboard across your chest.

Back-Floating Drill 2 Position
This drill is a variation of the previous drill. This time, pick up your feet rather than
pushing off of the bottom of the pool; alternatively, you can tread water if you are
performing the drill from a vertical position in a deep pool.
The drill consists of starting vertical and achieving a horizontal back float, then
lifting your head and returning to vertical. It helps you achieve the horizontal back
float and attend to how your head position affects your body position. Returning to
the teeter-totter analogy, when one end (your head) goes up, the other end (your
hips) goes down. Practice this drill several times in order to develop a good sense
of balance.
To increase diFFiculTy
• Use only a kicking motion with your legs or your hands to manipulate
your position in the water, but not both.
To decrease diFFiculTy
• Use both your arms and your legs.
Back-Floating Drill 3 Touch your nose
This drill builds on the skill of floating on the water in a T position. Assume the hori-
zontal back-float position with your arms straight out to your sides, then touch your
nose with an index finger while continuing to float. Repeat with the index finger of
the opposite hand. This more advanced drill helps you develop not only vertical and
horizontal balance but also lateral or side-to-side balance. As you get the hang of it,
try passing a tennis ball from one hand to the other while maintaining your balance.

FloaTing on your FronT
The next skill in this step involves floating on your front. This is essentially the same
skill as floating on your back—and the same physics apply—but with the added
element that your face is in the water. As a result, you can practice two skills at once:
floating and exhaling with your face in the water.
Front Floating With Arms Extended
From a standing position in the water, lie on the water in a position not unlike the
starfish discussed earlier. The objective here is to keep your head, shoulders, hips,
hands, and feet all at the surface of the water (figure 1.4).
You can try this first exercise while holding your breath. One indicator of success
is being able to look straight down at the bottom of the pool while relaxing on the
water in a horizontal position with your back straight. After you become comforta-
ble in this position, try it again—only this time breathe out slowly. Breath holding
causes tension, which can lead a swimmer to sink or struggle with balance; exhaling
slowly, on the other hand, aids relaxation and is also a necessary skill for performing
the competitive strokes. To control your breathing, rather than exhaling forcefully,
breathe out through your nose while humming.

This problem result comes from curling the back too much. Keep
your spine straight and your limbs relaxed and out away from the
body for balance. Once you are able to perform this skill successfully
for at least a few seconds, it is time to move on to more advanced
floating skills.
Front Floating in a T Position
The next part of this progression takes away some of the surfaces that swimmers use
for balance. As with floating on your back, the next skill to master is floating on your
front while bringing your legs together. Specifically, repeat the same skill, but this
time keep your arms out while bringing your legs together to make a T rather than
a starfish (figure 1.5). This skill requires a little more control and ability to relax on
the water.

The last part of this progression involves bringing your hands in front of your body
(figure 1.6). As before, imagine your face, chest, hips, and heels all at the surface—
only now they are also in the same line down the axis of your body. Once again, you
can try this skill while holding your breath until you have a stable floating position,
then slowly exhale. You may feel a little like you are sinking as you exhale due to the
change in the volume of air in your lungs. This is a more advanced floating skill, and
succeeding at it is a major accomplishment; at the same time, most swimmers find it
easier than doing the same thing on the back.

drills For PracTicing FronT FloaTing
As you have learned by now, floating on the front is fundamentally different from
floating on the back. Because of being facedown rather than faceup, you do not have
the freedom to breathe whenever you want to. The key to becoming comfortable in
the facedown position is to practice certain drills, which can move you toward being
as comfortable in this position as you are on your back.
Front-Floating Drill 1 Push-off
Stand at the side of the pool, sink under the water, and draw your feet up to the wall.
Next, push off horizontally and work to rise to the surface and float horizontally, as
before, by lying on the water. For many swimmers, this drill requires more than one
try. Here is the sequence once again: sink under the water, draw your feet up to the
wall, and gently push off with your feet. You have succeeded when you can do the
drill repeatedly with your legs together and your arms crossed. The purpose of this
drill is to help you get skilled at and comfortable with going from an underwater posi-
tion to a horizontal front float.
To increase diFFiculTy
• Push off harder.
• Hold your arms above your head.
To decrease diFFiculTy
• Have your coach or instructor assist you by holding your hands out in
front of you above your head.
• Keep your arms at your sides.
• Hold a kickboard across your chest.

than pushing off of the bottom of the pool; alternatively, you can tread water if you
are performing the drill from a vertical position in a deep pool. Perform this drill by
curling up into a tuck or ball position, then spreading out and trying to achieve the

This drill builds on the skill of lying on the water in a starfish position. Here, you alter-
nate moving your hands and feet with your hands above your head and your legs
spread with your hands out and your body in a T position. Try this both on your back
and on your front. The movement should be done very slowly and should mimic the
classic jumping-jack exercise. This drill helps you master the balancing forces and
find your center of buoyancy.
To increase diFFiculTy

The sWimming PosiTion
The last skills in this step involve using your newfound balance in the water to
achieve a swimming position and to master the art of reducing drag force. A good
swimming position requires a great deal of balance and a solid foundation that ena-
bles you to apply force to the water. As discussed earlier, it is critical to locate your
center of balance and be comfortable in the water.
Return for a moment to the teeter-totter analogy and the fact that your center of
buoyancy lies in the middle of your chest. If you stand poolside with your arms at
14

--- Page 34 Text ---
Floating
your sides, about two-thirds of your personal teeter-totter—that is, everything from
your chest to your feet—lies below your center of buoyancy. In order to achieve a
good swimming position, you need to bring the teeter-totter back into balance. To
that end, as soon as you raise your arms above your head, about half of your length
is above your center of buoyancy and the other half is below it. There is a time when
the body is extended in this fashion in each of the four competitive strokes.
Finding Your Balance on Your Back
If starting with the back float, the objective is to raise your arms above your head and
stretch them as far as you can. Be as long as you can from fingertips to toe tips and
still maintain a good floating position. Note that in this position, you have very few
ways to manipulate the water for lateral balance. Learning balance in this position
can prove challenging for people with limited flexibility or limited range of motion
in the shoulders. You have succeeded when you can maintain a relaxed floating posi-
tion with your hands extended beyond your head. Use the following steps to find
your balance while floating on your back.
PreParation
1. Begin by checking the water around you to ensure that you have enough
room to perform the skill.
2. To help with balance, move your arms and legs out away from your body.
3. Hold your fingers tightly together on both hands.
execution
1. Lie on your back with your arms extended above your head.
2. Stretch your arms to the longest position from fingertips to toes.
3. Make adjustments to the position of your upper back and hips to ensure that
the hands, shoulders, hips, and toes are all at the top of the water.
Streamlined Floating on Your Back
The next skill in floating on your back is to establish a streamlined position (figure
1.7)—one in which you are not only as long as you can be (from fingertips to toe tips)
but also as skinny as possible. This streamlining reduces drag force (discussed in step
2) and sets you up to move through the water more effectively in later stages of the
learning process. A good streamline involves certain key elements—extending the
body into a line as long as possible from fingertips to toe tips, keeping the core tight,
and making yourself as skinny as possible—starting at the fingertips and working
down from there.

the head and try to squeeze the forearms completely together.

Floating
As just mentioned in streamlined floating, head position depends on flexibility.
Your torso should be straight, and a good visual for this element is to imagine keep-
ing your spine as long as possible; this image helps you keep your head and torso in
line. Your legs should be closed completely and together all the way through, with
even your big toes connected. Your feet and toes should be pointed much like those
of a ballet dancer; the exact degree of angle depends on the flexibility of your ankles.
Streamlined Floating on Your Front
The streamline on the front (figure 1.8) is produced in the same manner as on the
back; it is more challenging, however, because your face is in the water. In both posi-
tions, success is measured by how well you maintain both the horizontal position in
the water and the long, stretched-out position with no movement.

Drills for an EffEctivE strEamlinE
Streamlining is often referred to as the fifth stroke. Its purpose is to set up a good
swimming position and minimize the drag force that slows you down and makes it
harder to perform each movement. You will learn more about streamlining in later
steps; for now, here are some drills to help you begin to master it.
Streamline Drill 1 shadow streamlines
This drill is done out of the pool and is good for both front and back streamlines.
Perform this drill on a sunny day on a pool deck, either next to a wall or in a location
where you can see your shadow on the deck. Assume the streamlined position as
described earlier and look at your shadow for visual feedback. Try different ways of
making your shadow as narrow as possible.

This drill emphasizes the importance of the streamline. Sink under the water and
assume the streamlined position with your feet on the wall. Push off forcefully and
then, after moving just a few feet, spread your arms and legs apart to make a brick.
You will feel yourself come almost immediately to a stop! Try it a few times and note
where in the pool you stop.

movements, see how far you go before stopping. This drill gives you an idea of the
importance of reducing drag force. Remember, in the streamlined position, your
hands are stacked and your arms are squeezing your ears (or head under and
squeezing your elbows together); your legs are long and your toes pointed.

Swimming: Steps to Success
success summary
In this step, you have learned about the foundations of good swimming with floating
and buoyancy. More specifically, you have learned and practiced drills that create
a solid foundation for swimming and for applying force to the water in order to
move through it efficiently. You have also learned about the importance of using the
streamlined position to reduce drag.
In addition, the drills and skills included in this step have led you to be more
comfortable in the water, especially in positions that are not natural in most of your
nonaquatic life. Being relaxed and comfortable is a key factor in the remaining steps
to swimming success. You are well on your way to success in swimming if you have
mastered the following skills:
1. Transitioning from a vertical position to floating on your back
2. Transitioning from a vertical position to floating on your front
3. Balancing on your center of buoyancy in a streamlined position on your back
4. Balancing on your center of buoyancy in a streamlined position on your front

In step 2, you will learn motions that put pressure on the water and movements
that impede motion in the water. Some of the drills do not resemble swimming, but
they show you how manipulating your body position and putting pressure on the
water in different ways can help you achieve your goal of success in swimming!
20

--- Page 40 Text ---
Step
2
Manipulating
the Water
The goal of this second step is to increase your awareness of drag force, propul-
sive force, and how specific movements create propulsion and minimize drag.
In other words, this step helps you understand how to use your body’s surfaces
to apply pressure on the water in order to move through it. By the end of this step,
you should be able to
• achieve an aquatic position that minimizes drag;
• get a feel for the water and where it slips off of your hands when anchoring
your hands during the crucial catch phase of a stroke;
• use a sculling motion for propulsion; and
• use flutter, dolphin, and breaststroke kicks for propulsion, both on your
back and on your front.
Drag Force anD ProPulsive Force
Drag force slows you down, whereas propulsive force makes you move. Drag force is
easy to understand if you think in terms of skydiving. While falling, skydivers accel-
erate due to gravity. They accelerate more if they make themselves skinny and verti-
cal (i.e., streamlined), thereby minimizing their cross-sectional area (the area facing
in their direction of travel) and in turn minimizing the resistance or drag force that
acts on them. On the other hand, if they spread their arms and legs out and become
more horizontal, they maximize the area that is perpendicular to their direction of
fall and thus slow down due to air resistance. At some point, our daredevils deploy
their parachutes, greatly increasing their cross-sectional area, in order to slow down
even more and avoid plummeting to their doom.
What does this have to do with swimming? Aerodynamics and hydrodynamics
have a lot in common! The big difference lies in the fact that water is about 750 times
denser than air and therefore involves much higher drag force. This strong resistance
is the reason that high divers can slow down so quickly upon entering the water even
at very high speeds. Of course, it also slows down swimmers.
At the same time, however, water gives swimmers a denser surface upon which to
apply pressure than air does. Swimmers can take advantage of this density by using
21

--- Page 41 Text ---
Swimming: Steps to Success
propulsive force to their advantage. Specifically, they apply pressure to the water
in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction in which they want to go. Think
of it this way: When you exit the pool, you place your hands on the pool deck in a
horizontal position—that is, perpendicular to the direction (up) in which you want
to go. As you apply pressure downward, your body rises above the position where it
started. Now, mentally rotate these dynamics from the vertical to the horizontal and
envision pressing against water instead of against the pool deck, and you have the
basic concept of using propulsive force for swimming.
For another analogy, consider rockets, which are powered by massive propulsive
force and resisted by relatively little drag force because they are long and skinny.
Similarly, as discussed in step 1 of this book, a swimmer is well advised to assume a
long, thin shape with good balance. Here in step 2, it is time to apply propulsive force.
Now that you have reduced drag force by becoming streamlined, you can move on
to using propulsive force by putting pressure on the water in an appropriate way.
MiniMizing Drag
Learning to minimize your “drag profile” takes repetition and some minor adjust-
ments. As in step 1, in which you achieved balance in a streamlined position, you
now start by ensuring that you are as long and narrow (i.e., as rocketlike) as possible.
In order to feel the effects of drag and minimize their influence, repeat the push-off
drill but add some new elements, starting with the manner in which you push off.
The following few instructions provide a sequence that not only helps you under-
stand how drag affects swimming but also reinforces your ability to balance in the
water (figure 2.1). For the first part of this sequence, position yourself in shallow
water at the pool wall. This is the only time in the sequence that you will get to push
against something solid, so make it count!
Tips for MiniMizing Drag
1. Posture is important. Make yourself as long as you can, from fingertips to
toe tips. Doing so includes really stretching and pointing your toes!
2. Avoid the “Superman flying position” in which your hands are separated
and your arms are parallel to each other. If you are trying to be narrow, stack
your hands one on top of the other as in the Torpedo drill in step 1. A point
at the front and at the back is best. Hydrodynamics tells us that you want to
be long and skinny so pierce the water and let it flow off a single point at the
end as well.
3. Your head is your rudder. If you keep your head down and your neck long,
you will go farther. This position is also worth practicing for another reason:
it is not far from your ideal front-swimming position.

correcTion
Distance traveled differs from person to person. We come in different
sizes and shapes, and some swimmers will go farther than others.
Keep at it, and those little adjustments will make a difference!
ProPulsive Force:
DeveloPing The caTch anD The Pull
Swim coaches regularly use the terms catch and pull. Roughly, catch means where you
anchor your hand or any other frontal surface in the water; it applies to all strokes.
Pull refers to the motion that comes immediately after the catch to provide propulsive
force. In this step, you work on the general feeling of putting pressure on the water but
not on the specific movement patterns for each stroke. That work comes in later steps.
The caTch
Manipulating the water across all strokes is a key to good swimming. As part of this
process, all strokes include a catch phase (figure 2.2), in which the key surface (whether
in the form of one hand or both hands) enters the water and begins to get perpendic-
ular to the direction in which you are going. For a mental representation of the catch
phase, swimmers think about anchoring the hand in the water, which hinges on three
factors. The first factor involves water movement. Turbulent water (as in a washing
machine) makes it hard to establish an anchor since the water is already moving. To
minimize this problem, find water that is not disturbed in front of you and stretch to
reach it.
The second factor involves the pitch or angle of the hand(s). Recall that it is almost
always best to put pressure on the water in a direction perpendicular to your direction
of travel. As a general rule, your fingers should almost always be pointed slightly
down on each stroke in order to encourage at least your hand to be perpendicular to
your direction of travel.
The last factor is strength. If you do not yet have the strength to hold the water, your
hand will waffle through it. Alternatively, being unable to hold the water may relate to
bad balance, which can weaken the propulsive force enough that it does not overcome
the drag force. Both of these issues can be corrected over time through practice.

MissTeP
You push down with your palm toward the bottom of the pool.
correcTion
To provide propulsive force, get your hand (and as many other arm
surfaces as possible) perpendicular to the direction in which you
want to go.
Drill For The caTch
The best way to develop kinesthetic awareness or feel for the water is to practice
in-water drills that minimize other factors. The best drill for this is the dig.
Catch Drill Dig
This three-part drill is best done in water in which you can stand. Using a stopwatch,
measure how long it takes you to walk as fast as you can from one end of the pool to
the other; record your time. Then repeat the walking exercise, but this time also use
your hands to sweep water out of your way laterally, as if plowing the water one arm
movement at a time. Once again, record your time. Next, use an overhand over-the-
water motion to accomplish the same task and record your time. Which technique
works best for you? (Simply walking should produce your slowest time.) Could you
feel your hands anchoring in the water and pulling forward? You might repeat the
drill a few times to ensure that you have done it correctly.
To increase DiFFiculTy
• Pull forcefully with your hands.
• Pull quickly with your hands.
To Decrease DiFFiculTy
• Walk at an easy pace, letting your hands provide balance.
• Use both arms at the same time.

sculling
The next skill in developing a feel for the water involves sculling (figure 2.3) and
putting pressure on the water with both your hands and your forearms. Your hand
position should be loose rather than rigid. Though some people advocate holding the
hand like a paddle or spoon, a rigid hand position provides no meaningful hydro-
dynamic advantage for most swimmers. The hand should be slightly curved like
the blade of a propeller on a plane or boat. The curvature provides great ability to
produce higher and lower areas of pressure similar to that also of an airplane wing.
Stand in the water with your back to the pool wall. Extend your arms straight out
in front of you and sink to the point where your shoulders are just below the surface
and your arms are completely covered with water. With your hands in a natural,
relaxed position and slightly cupped, rotate your thumbs down so that your palms
are angled slightly rather than parallel to the pool bottom.
Next, sweep your hands outward, making sure to keep your elbows straight. You
should feel pressure from the water on your hands and forearms. Once your hands
are about 2 feet (0.6 m) apart, rotate your thumbs up and your little fingers down so
that, once again, your palms are slightly angled—only this time toward each other
rather than away—and move your arms back to the original position. Again, keep
your elbows straight.
Repeat this motion several times and adjust the pitch of your palms to get a good
feel for the water. As you progress, angle your fingers down slightly as well. The
sculling motion creates higher pressure on the palm side of your hand and lower
pressure on the back of your hand, thus providing propulsive force.

Preparation
1. Check the water around

2. Extend the arms in front and

4. Keeping the elbows and arms
long but not locked, repeat

forward movement.
MissTeP
You keep your hands very stiff.
correcTion
Relax your hands and feel the water.
MissTeP
You don’t go anywhere when sculling.
correcTion
Make sure that your hands are slightly cupped, which provides the
same high-pressure and low-pressure propulsion as propellers and
airplane wings. Water will flow faster over the top part of the hand as
it has a greater distance to travel, and the inside arc of the hand has
a smaller linear distance, so the water remains easier to hold. The
faster moving water on the top of the hand is low pressure, and the
palm would be higher pressure. To achieve equilibrium, the barrier
(i.e., the hand) will move toward the lower pressure.
28

Manipulating the Water
Drill For sculling
Use the following drill to help practice the sculling skill.
Sculling Drill sculling With a Pull Buoy
Next, put this skill to work in a swimming position. Place a pull buoy between your
legs slightly above your knees. Lie flat and facedown on the water in a neutral posi-
tion, as described in step 1, with your arms extended above your head. Keep your
hands relaxed, with your fingers pitched slightly downward, and slowly try the scull-
ing motion until you feel yourself being pulled forward.
This is a complex skill that takes time to master. It requires movements that are not
fast, rigid, or mechanical but slow, controlled, and fluid. Use slow, rhythmic move-
ments and make sure that your hands never stop; they should be sweeping either
out or in at any given time. Failure to master this skill does not prevent a person
from swimming, but mastering it enables greater proficiency in later stages of the
learning process. Repeat the drill several times, experimenting with hand angle and
positioning to see what works best for you in creating propulsion. To develop a good
catch, you must feel where the water pressure is on your hands and forearms!
To increase DiFFiculTy
• Do not use a pull buoy.
To Decrease DiFFiculTy
• Bend your elbows slightly.
• Use a swimmer’s snorkel.

down the pool length with little difficulty.
KicKing
When done correctly, kicking is a powerful part of swimming. The first kick to master
is the flutter kick (figure 2.4), which is part of both freestyle and backstroke swimming.
It is performed with alternating leg movements designed to put pressure on the water
via both up and down movements. The more surfaces you engage in applying pressure,
the better. The basic idea here is to initiate the kick in the hip; it is also helpful to use
the strong muscles of the core for propulsion, and that technique is addressed in future
steps. For now, focus on the basics of kicking as a propulsive force.
The following drill progression helps you master the flutter kick. The first part of
the progression helps you develop an effective mental image of what your legs are

Swimming: Steps to Success
supposed to do. Of course, creatures evolved for swimming use well-adapted body
parts to make movements that are long and fluid—for example, the movements of a
fish, dolphin, or whale tail. Humans are at a disadvantage in this regard because we
have solid bones in our legs rather than reticulated vertebrae, making us less flexible
for fluid movement. In compensating for this deficit, it helps to envision the move-
ment that you want. You might imagine, for instance, that the knee and ankle of each
leg are connected by a rubber band. This image helps you keep your legs long and
loose as you drive motion from your lower core.
Figure 2.4 FluTTer KicKing
Preparation
1. Get in the water and grab the gutter.
2. From a standing position facing the
wall, kick your legs up to the surface
and make your body horizontal (parallel
to the pool bottom).
3. At this stage, it is okay to use your fore-
arms and the wall to help you achieve
a
a horizontal position and to have your
head out of the water.
4. Keep your legs as long and loose as
possible (do not actively point your
toes).
Execution
1. Make sure that you can sustain a steady
rhythmic kick (speed is not important
yet) that feels like you are putting pres-
sure on the water all the way down the
b
length of your leg (advanced swimmers
have described this feeling as the water
seeming to roll all the way down the leg
and off the toes).
2. Once you are comfortable in the hori-
zontal position, put your face in the
water and extend your arms so that just
your hands are on the wall.
3. As you continue to kick, you should
feel your hands being pressed toward
the wall. Maintain the same extended
streamlined position that you developed
c
in step 1. If your hands are grabbing the
wall and hanging on instead of being
pushed toward the wall, check yourself
for correct positioning from hands to
toes.
30

--- Page 50 Text ---
Manipulating the Water
In earlier parts of step 2, you developed a mental image and achieved a horizon-
tal position in the water while using your legs to maintain balance. The next part of
this step ensures that the kick you are developing is propulsive. With proper kicking
imagery, it is now time to use your legs to manipulate and put pressure on the water.
As your feet get to the surface, keep in mind that your goal is to put pressure on
the water, which means that your legs must be in the water. Many novice swimmers
equate kicking hard with big splashes; in reality, however, those splashes indicate
that the energy exerted is being absorbed by the water rather than benefitting the
swimmer. Try to have just your heel—rather than your whole foot—break the surface
of the water. A quick head-to-toe check with the following questions in mind will
help to make sure you are performing the skill correctly.
1. Are your arms extended all the way out?
2. Is your core long, or are you doing a “crunching” motion?
3. Is your pelvis tucked under rather than staying flat, thus causing your feet
to sink?
4. Do you feel the effort in your glutes and upper thighs, which indicates that
you are using your whole leg and core? Or do you feel it in your quads, near
your knees, which indicates that you are using only your lower legs?
5. Are your ankles stiff or loose? Loose is good.
MissTeP
You splash a lot.
correcTion
To achieve propulsive force, get your feet (and as much other leg
surface as possible) in contact with the water. Keep your legs long
and loose.
MissTeP
You don’t go anywhere when you kick.
correcTion
Rather than point your toes or make your leg stiff, imagine curling
your toes. This approach keeps your feet flexed but prevents your
legs from being stiff.

Drills For FluTTer KicKing
Once you have gone through all of these helpful cues and can feel the pressure that
you apply to the water, it is time to face the real test of propulsive force—kicking and
actually providing some movement forward.
Kicking Drill 1 Fingertip Pressure
Move about a yard (m) away from the wall, then establish a neutral buoyant posi-
tion on your front by lying on the water in the streamlined position described in step
1. Using only your kicking skill, kick toward the wall with your hands stretched out
so that your fingertips touch the wall first. Once your fingers have touched the wall,
continue kicking so that you feel pressure on your fingertips. This pressure indicates
that you have developed a propulsive kick and can purposefully manipulate the
water using your legs.
To increase DiFFiculTy
• Touch the wall with only a single finger.
• Exhale the whole time and repeat.
To Decrease DiFFiculTy
• Grab the gutter.

down your leg and off your toes. 3 points: You can push your fingers into
the wall but only for 5 or fewer seconds.
5–7 points: You can push your fingers
into the wall for more than 10 seconds.
Kicking Drill 2 Kickboard
The next part of the progression ensures that your kick is indeed propulsive. Using
a kickboard for balance only, place your hands on the lower corners of the board.
Facing away from the wall in the water, pull your feet up, place them on the wall, and
push off on your front. Make sure that your face is in the water and look directly at
the bottom of the pool.
Now, begin the same rhythmic kicking that you developed earlier in this progres-
sion. It should propel you down the length of the pool at a very slow speed. If you
come to a stop or even go backward, check for correct positioning from your hands
to your toes. Many swimmers come to the pool with a limited range of motion in the
ankles. Make sure that your ankles are slightly plantar-flexed, so that your toes point
away from your body, but not so much as to make your legs rigid.
32

--- Page 52 Text ---
Manipulating the Water
When you need to breathe, simply apply pressure to the kickboard and lift your
head for air. Make this motion quick in order to maintain your balance in the water
and get your face back in the water to stabilize your balance. As you progress in this
part, try rotating the head to the side to breathe.
To increase DiFFiculTy
• Place your hands together on the kickboard.
• Use a less stable pull bouy in the place of a kickboard.
• Don’t use a kickboard at all.
To Decrease DiFFiculTy
• Rest your forearms on the kickboard rather than merely grabbing the
end of it.

KicKing WiThouT a KicKBoarD
Once you have mastered the skill with the kickboard (using the Kickboard drill to
practice), it is time once again to put your propulsive kicking force to the test. Repeat
the process just described, but this time do it without the assistance of the kickboard
(figure 2.5). The goal is to kick in a streamlined position. If you were able to do so
with a kickboard, then this transition should be a little easier. The new challenge here
is that when you breathe, you should use the same sculling motion described ear-
lier in this step. Simply sweep your hands out and in rhythmically to apply enough
pressure on the water to allow you to lift your head for a quick breath. You can then
continue with a freestyle stroke. Once you have mastered this technique—and it may
take a few tries—it is time to move to flutter kicking on your back.

FluTTer KicKing on your BacK
Flutter kicking on your back (figure 2.6) differs slightly from kicking on your front. Since you
are on your back, the kicking motion is up for the most part (you will learn more about that
later). Once again, it is helpful to develop an effective mental image—in this case, that of a
soccer ball floating on the water that you kick up into the air with the top of your foot. This
mental image helps you apply pressure in the right places and recruit the proper muscles. As
with kicking on your front, imagine the joints of each leg being connected by a rubber band;
staying long and loose is still a key.
Remember both your mental image and the feeling of pressure on the water from both the
tops and the bottoms of your feet. Ensure that your toes just break the surface. As before, big
splashes do not provide propulsive force and should be avoided. Kicking with your feet and
legs coming out of the water makes big splashes. Since you are on your back, your toes will
be the first to break the surface. As land-based creatures, we tend to have a natural affinity for
leading this kick with the heel, as in a running or cycling motion. In correcting this tendency,
it can be helpful to work with a kickboard (as described in the following Missteps section).
MissTeP
You make big splashes while kicking with your heels first.

Drills For KicKing WiThouT a KicKBoarD
As you develop kicking proficiency, the following drills will help you to not rely on
any equipment for balance or assistance.
Boardless Kicking Drill 1 Kicking on your Back or your Front
Once you have achieved propusion in this position on the back, repeat this same
part, the flutter kick on the back, but with your hands now above your head in a
streamlined position. Doing so requires you to change your position on the water
slightly—your spinal curvature will change—in order to compensate for not having
your hands at your sides to help with balance. As before, you should feel the effort
in your lower core, specifically there will be muscle contraction and fatigue in your
upper thighs and glutes. If you have trouble achieving propulsion, do a simple
hands-to-toes check for positioning and technique to ensure that you are doing it
right. Once you have mastered this on your back, try the same on your front. When
you go to breathe, rotate the head to the side as with the kickboard drill.
To increase DiFFiculTy
• Drop one arm.
To Decrease DiFFiculTy

Boardless Kicking Drill 2 underwater Kicking
Once you have mastered flutter kicking on both your back and your front on the
surface of the water, it is time to fine-tune your kick for maximum benefit. In previous
parts of this progression, you have learned how to apply pressure to the water with
your legs, feet, and toes. The instructions have emphasized kicking in a specific
direction, but the most effective and efficient swimmers can manipulate the water by
applying pressure with both the tops and the bottoms of their legs and feet.
36

--- Page 56 Text ---
Manipulating the Water
The next part of developing this ability involves kicking on a streamline under the
water. Remember that at no point should you engage in extended breath holding!
Remember also to exhale slowly.
As described in step 1, put both feet on the wall and assume a position in which
your head, knees, and toes are up. Release the hand from the wall, touch your
hands together under the water, and push off in a streamlined position while keeping
your head down. Kick underwater for as long as you can before needing a breath;
keep your legs long and loose and kick both up and down. Repeat this skill several
times; it can be difficult to find your balance while putting pressure on the water, but
you will master the skill with enough repetition.

and the bottoms of your feet.
DolPhin KicK
The next propulsive motion to learn is that of the dolphin, or butterfly, kick. Though
somewhat similar to the flutter kick, this technique for manipulating the water is a
little more difficult to master. Instead of alternating the legs, this kick keeps the legs
together as if they were bonded, thus mimicking closely the motion of a dolphin’s
tale. The advantage of this kick is that it applies more surface area to the water to
produce more propulsive force.
Dolphin Kicking at the Wall
Unlike the flutter kick, this kick (figure 2.7) derives its power from the middle part
of the core—from the lower part of the rib cage down through the pelvis. Let the
strong muscles of your core initiate most of the work. Your legs should stay together
the entire time, and, as with the flutter kick, they should be long and loose. A good
mental image for this kick is the motion of a dolphin or whale; try to mimic that
motion with your body, from your chest on down. Some swimmers also find it help-
ful to imagine that their legs are glued together and cannot be separated. To work on
this skill, use the same progression used for the flutter kick on your front.

In the first few parts of this progression, you have developed a mental image and
achieved a horizontal position in the water using your legs to maintain your balance.
The next part is to make sure that the kick you are developing is propulsive. You
should be in the same extended streamlined position that you developed in step 1. If
your hands are grabbing the wall and hanging on instead of being pushed toward it,
do a simple hands-to-toes check for proper positioning.

Swimming: Steps to Success
Misstep
You nod up and down to make yourself go.
CorreCtion
The kick comes from the lower core and rib cage; try not to move as
if you were bobbing for apples.
Misstep
Your hands are grabbing on to the wall.
CorreCtion
Extend the arms and make sure your kick is propulsive rather than
having the arms do the work of holding you to the wall.
Misstep
You curl up and push at the water with your feet.
CorreCtion
Keep the legs long and loose. Rather than pointing the toes, think
about curling them as if picking a penny up off the pool deck.
Dolphin Kicking on Your Back
Dolphin kicking on your back (figure 2.9) differs only slightly from kicking on your
front. As before, developing an appropriate mental image for the action can help you
apply pressure in the right places and recruit the proper muscles. The mental image
here, as with kicking on your front, is to think of your leg joints as being connected
by a rubber band; staying long and loose is still a key.
Misstep
The water washes back up to your face.
CorreCtion
The two most likely culprits are your knees breaking the surface of
the water and the tops of your feet “pushing” at the water. To correct
this misstep and produce a propulsive kick, hold a kickboard with
your hands down at your hips, extending the kickboard over your
knees. Now try the kicking motion again; if you feel your knees touch-
ing the board and making it bounce up and down, you are not finish-
ing you kick underwater and are probably leading with your heels or
bicycling your kick.

Drills for Dolphin KicKing
As you perform these drills, keep your legs as long and loose as possible (do not
actively point your toes). As your feet get to the surface, keep in mind that your goal
is to put pressure on the water, which means that your legs must be in the water.
The keys here are to sustain a steady rhythmic kick (do not worry about being fast
just yet) that feels like you are putting pressure on the water all the way down your
leg. Once you have mastered this skill, it is time to move on to the next part of the
progression.
41

Swimming: Steps to Success
Dolphin Kick Drill 1 Kickboard
The next part of the progression is to ensure that your kick is indeed propulsive. In
the water, use a kickboard for balance only, placing your hands on the lower corners
of the board. Facing away from the wall, pull your feet up, place them on the wall,
and push off on your front. Make sure that your face is in the water and look directly
at the bottom of the pool.
Now begin the same rhythmic kicking motion that you developed earlier in this
progression. It should propel you down the length of the pool at a very slow speed.
If you come to a stop or even go backward, check for correct positioning from your
hands to your toes. Many swimmers come to the pool with a limited range of motion
in the ankles. Make sure that your ankles are slightly plantar-flexed, so that your toes
point away from your body but not so much as to make your legs rigid.
When you need to breathe, simply apply pressure to the kickboard and lift your
head for air. Make this motion quick in order to maintain your balance in the water
and get your face back in the water to stabilize your balance.
To increase DiFFiculTy
• Place one hand on the kickboard and kick on your side (right side for 25
kicks and left side for 25 kicks).
• Eliminate the kickboard and kick in a streamlined position.
• Kick underwater in a streamlined position.
To Decrease DiFFiculTy
• Use fins to prevent that stalling feeling and avoid rushing the drill.
• Lay your upper arms across the kickboard by gripping the top of the
board to keep your face out of the water. Be aware that doing so may
put extra stress on your lower back.

Dolphin Kick Drill 2 Without a Kickboard
Once you have mastered the skill with the kickboard, it is time once again to put
your propulsive kicking force to the test. Repeat the process just described, but this
time do it without the assistance of the kickboard. The goal is to kick in a streamlined
position. If you were able to do so with a kickboard, then this transition should be a
little easier. The new challenge here is that when you breathe, you should use the
same sculling motion described earlier in this step. Simply sweep your hands out
and in rhythmically to apply enough pressure on the water to allow you time to lift
your head for a quick breath. Once you have mastered this technique—and it may
take a few tries—it is time to move to dolphin kicking on your back.
To increase DiFFiculTy

kicks and left side for 25 kicks).

Dolphin Kick Drill 3 on your Back
This drill is essentially the same as kicking on your front but without the kickboard.
It is best to do it in a streamlined position if you can. The purpose of this drill is to
help you develop the ability to put pressure on the water in an up-and-down fashion.
To increase DiFFiculTy
• Kick underwater in a streamlined position. Propulsive force can be gen-
erated with an asymmetrical kick; however, maximum propulsion comes
from kicking in both directions. This capability comes into play in both
the butterfly and the backstroke.

BreasTsTroKe KicK
The last kicking skill is the breaststroke kick (figure 2.10). Draw your heels up to your
hips while keeping your knees close together, then point your toes out and apply
pressure to the water with your insteps and the inside calf of each leg. The kick is per-
formed simultaneously with both legs. The following progression helps you ensure
that you are doing it correctly to provide maximum propulsion.

Figure 2.10 BreasTsTroKe KicK WiTh one leg
Preparation
1. Begin by standing near the
pool wall in water that is at
least chest deep. Be sure
that your chest is touching
the wall.
2. Starting with your right leg,
draw your heel up with your
knee still touching the wall in
the dorsiflexed or L position.
Once your thigh is parallel to
a the bottom of the pool, stop
raising the leg.
Execution
1. While in this position, slide
your heel out and away from
the centerline of your body
while keeping your knee in
the same place. This action
may seem awkward at first.
The key is to make sure that
your heel is farther from the
center of your body than your
knee is. You may need to use
the wall for balance.
2. Once your foot is in position,

Breaststroke Kick With Both Legs
If you can feel pressure in the critical areas when breaststroke-kicking with each leg,
then you are ready to try both legs together (figure 2.11). Some swimmers have prob-
lems with flexibility in the hips, knees, and ankles and are not as effective as others,
so do not let this frustrate you. For most people, this action requires several repeti-
tions to master.

Manipulating the Water
Breaststroke Kick With Propulsion
Now that you feel the pressure on the water, it is time to ensure that it is propulsive
pressure by moving through the water (figure 2.12). The next part of the progression
involves lying on your back in the neutral position described in step 1 with your
hands at your sides for balance. Once you have achieved equilibrium, draw your
heels up while trying to keep your upper legs underwater. This is slightly different
from being on the wall but involves the same type of movement.
Once your heels are close to your hips, rotate your heels out so that they are wider
than your knees, then sweep them together. As before, this motion is more about
pressure on the water than about the speed of the movement. Squeeze your ankles
together. Did you move? The pressure on the water should have caused you to move
headfirst. Once you have completed one kick, return to the neutral position and let
your momentum fade. Repeat the same motion until you are comfortable with it.
Figure 2.12 BreasTsTroKe KicK WiTh ProPulsion
Preparation
1. Perform the wall exercise for the
breaststroke kick with both legs

room to perform the skill, then
find your back-floating position
as described in step 1.
Execution
1. With your arms fully extended,

The next part of the progression is to transfer this skill to the front. Using a kickboard,
repeat the same motions that you performed on your back. The key is to make
your movements slow and correct. Once you feel comfortable on your front with the
kickboard, put the board away and try the skill in the streamlined position. When
you need to breathe, use the same sculling motion described earlier; remember to
breathe out slowly.
To increase DiFFiculTy
• Stay in a streamlined position.

Freestyle
Over the years, versions of freestyle swimming have gone by many names, includ-
ing trudgen stroke, Australian crawl, and front crawl. Competitive freestyle was
born in the late 1800s, when John Arthur Trudgen witnessed native South Amer-
icans swimming with an overhand recovery and a wide, scissorlike kick. He carried
the stroke back to England, where it took on his name despite being characterized as
un-European barbaric thrashing.
Around the turn of the century in Australia, a similar stroke was used with a
flutter kick by a Solomon Islander named Alick Wickham. That version was devel-
oped further by coach Richmond “Dick” Cavill into what we now recognize as some-
thing closer to freestyle, which was referred to as the Australian crawl. In the modern
era, coaches added a six-beat (i.e., six kicks per one arm stroke) kick, and the stroke
became the front crawl, which later came to be referred to simply as freestyle. Tech-
nically speaking, freestyle races can be swum using any stroke, but the crawl stroke
is the fastest of the competitive strokes and therefore has become synonymous with
freestyle.
The Three rs
Good freestyle depends on the three Rs: reach, rotation, and relaxation. Reach is dis-
cussed with the catch and pull. Rotation involves turning the body over by rotating
around the anchor point—the hand. It is crucial to ensure that your hip and shoulder
stay in the same plane. Relaxation involves learning to relax the body parts that are
not helping you swim more efficiently.
Good freestyle is efficient and effective. Swimmers who master freestyle find it is
as easy as walking. To that end, this step helps you develop the following skills:
• Horizontal body line
• Rotation on a long axis
• High elbow catch
• Pressure on the water throughout the stroke
• Kicking rhythm
• Effective breathing
• Effective timing
Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective
freestyle stroke.
51

--- Page 71 Text ---
Swimming: Steps to Success
One key element of effective freestyle is maintaining a good horizontal position
on the water. As mastered in step 1 (specifically, floating on your front), the basic
position involves lying on the water with your head, hips, feet, and hands all at the
surface of the water. As you remain stretched out on the water, ensure that your face
is in the water and that you are looking straight down at the bottom of the pool.
Basic FreesTyle sTrOke
A good freestyle armstroke consists of four basic elements that provide the bulk of
the propulsive force for swimming: catch, pull, finish, and recovery. The first is the
catch. Beginning with the left hand, you will want to pitch the fingers down so that
the hand is perpendicular to the direction you want to go (figure 3.1a). As the hand
pitches down, you will rotate the elbow and shoulder so that the forearm is also per-
pendicular to the direction you want to go. The second element is the pull. During
this part of the stroke, you will pull the arm through so that the hand and forearm
stay perpendicular to the direction you are going and the elbow remains bent (figure
3.1b). The finish of the stroke is next (figure 3.1c). As you progress through the middle
and your arm is about midway down your body, you will transition from a pulling
motion to that of a pushing motion almost as if you were going to try to slap your
thigh with your hand. Lastly is the recovery (figure 3.1d). At this point you will raise
the arm out of the water almost as if pulling your hand out of your pocket and bring it
back to the front position where you started by sliding your hand fingers first into the
water 8 to 10 inches above your head and extending the arm fully after that. Repeat
this same motion with your right arm and hand and then stop. Remember that as
you work on mastering a skill, it is crucial to move in a slow and controlled manner
at first. As you may notice, kicking is not mentioned here; this does not mean that
you should not kick but simply that you should focus on the skill being described.

FreesTyle sTrOke cycle
Once you have gone through one stroke cycle—one right arm and one left arm—it
is time to put together multiple stroke cycles (figure 3.2). Remember that (unlike in
some other sports) faster is not always better in swimming. Keep your movements
slow and deliberate. The real objective in this part of your development is to anchor
your hand and forearm in the water and pull yourself over them. Stop when you
need air.

c
MissTep
You make a lot of splashing and thrashing movements.
cOrrecTiOn
Splashing and thrashing indicate that the water is absorbing your
energy and thus becoming turbulent. Turbulence makes it difficult
to put pressure on the water. To correct this misstep, think about
slipping your hand into a glove during the recovery (reentry into the
water) and slapping your thigh at the end of the stroke. It is best to
use long, controlled movements.
MissTep
You cannot get your arm fully out of the water on the recovery.
cOrrecTiOn
As you finish the stroke, rotate your hip on the same side as the
stroking arm and the shoulder of your stroking arm toward the sky.
This action allows your upper arm to be more vertical without reach-
ing behind your back, which is not an easy position to attain and
expends considerable energy.

Swimming: Steps to Success
Drills FOr arMsTrOkes
The fastest and most efficient freestyle swimmers—whether in a race or in the work-
out pool—tend to share certain characteristics. The hands always pass in front of the
swimmer; the hands and forearms are perpendicular to the direction of travel for
the maximum amount of time; and the hands accelerate throughout the course of
the stroke under the water. To develop these characteristics, use the following drills.
Note that some of the drills involve overcorrection of common flaws, but all of them
help you develop elements of good freestyle.
Armstroke Drill 1 catch-Up
This drill helps you with balance, rhythm, and armstrokes; it also helps you develop
great kinesthetic awareness and is especially helpful to tactile learners. To perform
this drill, stand on the pool deck and form the index finger and thumb of your left
hand into an L shape with the other fingers also extended. Next, create the mirror
image of that shape (i.e., a backward L shape) with your right hand. Now, without
looking, raise your hands above your head and try to touch just the tips of your
thumbs together.
In the pool, lie in a horizontal position in the water. This is the same position to
which your hands will recover as one hand “catches up” to the other. Make sure that
only the tips of your thumbs touch each other, thus leaving your arms about head-
width apart. As you start the catch, make sure that you are doing the drill slowly
enough to concentrate on getting your fingers down and your elbow up and pushing
all the way through. You can expect some body rotation, which works to your advan-
tage. As a larger portion of your body is out of the water, the coefficient of drag for air
is much lower than that of water, which is more than 500 times as dense. This larger
coefficient means that the more of you that is in the water, the more drag force needs
to be overcome. Perform this drill with a comfortable rhythmic flutter kick.
TO increase DiFFicUlTy
• Close your eyes as before and complete 10 armstrokes in a 25-yard (or
25-meter) pool, making sure that only your thumb tips touch.
• Perform six kicks per armstroke.
TO Decrease DiFFicUlTy
• Use fins to prevent that stalling feeling and isolate the catch and pull.
• Use a pull buoy to maintain balance.
• Use a swimmer’s snorkel.

Armstroke Drill 2 Underwater recovery
This is a great drill for focusing on just the catch and the pull. Lie flat in the water,
then catch and pull with one arm and then with the other. As you finish the stroke at
your thigh, instead of recovering your hand and arm over the water, slide your hand
forward as far as you can to catch up with your other hand, then repeat with your
opposite arm. This approach reduces the need to worry about the recovery.

Swimming: Steps to Success
Armstroke Drill 3 hands in Fists
This is a classic drill used to promote an early vertical forearm for an effective catch
and pull. Instead of using an open hand for propulsion and holding the water, make
a fist with each hand. There will be some splashing on the entry, but this drill com-
pels you to get your elbow up and pull with the surface area of your forearm.
TO increase DiFFicUlTy
• Hold a tennis ball or racquetball in each hand to further decrease the
surface area of your hands.
• Wrap your fingers over the end of a paddle (one in each hand) without
using the straps. The minute your elbow drops, the paddle pulls away
from your arm, thus making it harder to hold the paddle.
TO Decrease DiFFicUlTy
• Use fins to prevent that stalling feeling and isolate the catch and pull.

To perform an effective recovery, you must be able to use your core muscles to turn
your hip and shoulder over as one piece (figure 3.3). This skill also helps you develop
an effective catch and pull, which in freestyle swimming means that you can reach
farther. In addition, effective rotation helps set up a good position in which to get air.

Drills FOr rOTaTiOn
Rotation through the core has been the subject of much recent debate in competitive
swimming. Some competitors swim flatter, with little rotation, whereas others swim
through the hips with considerable rotation. Both approaches can be correct, depend-
ing on the swimmer, but the most sustainable recreational swimming allows for most
people to use the core to aid in rotation rather than relying on spinal flexibility. Some
swimmers have more flexibility and strength in the spine and torso, allowing them
to twist easier.
Rotation Drill 1 Tap your head
This drill gives you feedback about where your hands are in relation to the centerline
of your body and your axis of rotation, as well as the vertical position of your head. It
also compels you to rotate your body to perform the drill correctly. With all that said,
the drill itself is very simple. Gently touch your fingertips to the crown of your head
on the recovery, then place your hand in the water to recover for the next catch and
pull. As in the catch-up drill, wait until one hand has completely recovered before
beginning the next catch.

Rotation Drill 2 pull Buoy Between the ankles
This is a great drill for isolating your core (rather than your kick) as the primary cause
of rotation. Place a pull buoy between your ankles and swim as usual in a slow,
controlled fashion. Swimmers who swim “flat” rather than rotating will find their feet
fishtailing all over the pool. To avoid or correct this problem, concentrate on using
your core muscles to rotate your body and try to get your upper arm (from shoulder
to elbow) as close to vertical as possible.

seeing how far you can go in 20 strokes. Repeat this part multiple times, trying to

BreaThing
As land-based creatures, we cannot process oxygen out of water as fish do; therefore,
we must find a way to breathe air while swimming. In freestyle, this need is met
by rotating the head so that the mouth and nose are out of the water at a good time
during the stroke cycle (figure 3.4), thus allowing the swimmer to breathe without
interrupting his or her rhythm. The best way to do so is to rotate the face out of the
water as an arm is finishing a stroke at the thigh and beginning the recovery. The
rotation is initiated at the shoulder and hip, and the head follows.
This technique is less about rotating the neck and more about proper positioning.
There is a bow wave with the forward propulsion that allows for a trough to be pro-
duced; the depth and utility of that differ from swimmer to swimmer. A bow wave in
the world of fluid mechanics is a wave that is produced by the vector displacement
of water by another object. The size of the crest and trough produced depends on the
mass, velocity, and displacement buoyancy of the object. As the body moves through
the water, the crown of the head will cause the water in front of it to increase in
pressure as the head moves forward. The water will seek equilibrium from this high
pressure state by moving to a lower pressure. Due to the incompressibility of water,
the water molecules “choose” a direction to go with some moving down and others
moving up or to the side with and infinite number of vector possibilities. The rising
part is offset by a falling part producing both a crest and a trough which is below
the waterline and will be helpful when trying to rotate the mouth and nose toward
the air to breathe. The objective here is to get your air as quickly as possible so that
you can get your face back in the water before your hand finishes the recovery, thus
readying you for the next catch.

helpful to identify which side is preferred. Then move on to continuous breathing

Breathing is more about timing than about anything else. Swimming is one of only a few
sports in which your breathing is a life-and-death decision. When running or partici-
pating in other sports, your respiration is not really something you have to consciously
think about when participating. Swimming on the other had is different. Inhaling with
your face in the water will produce some unwanted consequences, including death.
This factor is particularly important for new swimmers. As you progress through the
skills, you may find yourself holding your breath, which is a mistake. Make sure to
exhale slowly and inhale rhythmically rather than gulping at the air.
Breathing Drill 1 One-arm
The one-arm freestyle drill comes in several versions. One of the most effective
approaches is to stroke with only one arm down the length of the pool with the other
arm at your side. On every stroke, breathe to the nonstroking side and be sure to
rotate to the stroking side. The timing of this drill is crucial. It must be done slowly,
and the shoulder of the stroking arm should be touching your ear when you breathe.
In addition, your stroking arm should be fully extended until your face is back in the
water to initiate the catch. Repeat the process by switching arms.
Breathing on both sides is a great skill to master, but many swimmers prefer one
side or the other. Forty years ago, coaches advocated that one needed to learn to
breathe on both sides in order to be a good swimmer. Enter Grant Hackett, multiple
world-record holder and Olympic champion, who breathed exclusively on the right
side. Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, does the same thing. In
addition, forcing the issue of breathing on both sides detracts from the needed focus
on your propulsive movements. The breathing question can be addressed (if at all)
once you progress far enough to work with a swim coach.

Breathing Drill 2 3-5-3-7
This is a popular drill used to train breath control and relaxation. It is not designed to
have swimmers hold their breath. The numbers (3, 5, 3, 7) indicate how many strokes
you should take between breaths per 25 yards. In other words, for the first 25 yards,
breathe every three strokes; for the second 25, breathe every five strokes, and so
on. This drill is challenging even when done slowly and with effective movements,
and the odd numbers cause an alternating of the breathing pattern. This alternat-
ing pattern is a great skill to have, especially for racers, triathletes, and open-water
swimmers. It helps with having a faster breathing rate at higher workload levels, and
it can aid in navigation for open-water swimmers.

kicking
As discussed in step 2, the flutter kick is a very important skill, and the challenge
now is to apply that skill in a swimming motion—specifically, the freestyle stroke,
in which the body is no longer flat on the water. Although you start by kicking with
a kickboard, you incorporate rotation when breathing. When done correctly, kicking
not only provides propulsive force but also assists with balance. The flutter kick, in
particular, uses an alternating leg movement, and the whole leg is moved both up
and down to put pressure on the water both on the down stroke of the kick and on
the upstroke.
Many novice swimmers have difficulty with this skill because their legs are too
rigid and produce no propulsive power. When done properly, the kick’s power comes
from the hip, and the strong muscles of the lower core are actively engaged. The rest
of the leg is kept long and loose, and you are encouraged to think of the knee joint
and ankle joint of each leg as being connected by a rubber band. In this way, the kick
is more likely to be long and fluid rather than stiff and mechanical.
It is okay to point your toes slightly, but pointing too aggressively (rather than
using your ankle’s natural flexion) can lead to a rigid and unproductive kick. An
unproductive kick can also be caused by having your foot out of the water. Remem-
ber, the goal is to exert pressure on the water; generally, therefore, only your heel
should break the surface.
MissTep
Your kick is rigid and not propulsive.
cOrrecTiOn
Narrow your kick and speed it up just a bit. Remember that a splash
indicates simply that the water is absorbing your energy. Think of
trying to kick with your feet inside of a bucket or a basketball hoop.
Rather than pointing your toes, think about curling them and keeping
you knees and ankles “floppy” or loose.

Swimming: Steps to Success
MissTep

cOrrecTiOn
Check your feet and ankles. Are they pointed and rigid? Are they
dorsiflexed (in an L shape)? Keep the lower part of your legs loose
and your feet slightly pointed. Keeping your legs long, with little knee
flexion, prevents “bicycling” or pushing at the water. Remember that
the kick should come from the hip.
Drills FOr kicking
Kicking is critical to taking pressure off of your shoulders and engaging your core
in the swimming motions. The following drills help you to practice your propulsive
kick.
Kicking Drill 1 kickboard
This is a good drill for developing flutter-kick basics. To do it, grab the kickboard at
the bottom and extend your arms. Push off of the wall and begin flutter-kicking on
your front with your face in the water. Exhale slowly and drop one arm to your side
while rotating. This drill is also a good way to practice your breathing; make sure to
turn your hip over and catch a quick breath to the side. Recover your hand over the
water as usual. At this point, you may feel your hips sink. This is a problem because
it disturbs the line of travel and impedes efficiency. Experiment with the amplitude,
size, and frequency of your kicks to keep the hips up.
TO increase DiFFicUlTy
• Place one hand on the kickboard and kick on your side (right side for 25
yards and left side for 25 yards).
• Eliminate the kickboard and kick in a streamlined position.
• Kick underwater in a streamlined position.
TO Decrease DiFFicUlTy
• Use fins to prevent that stalling feeling and avoid rushing the drill.
• Rest your upper arms across the kickboard by gripping the top to keep
your face out of the water. Be aware that doing so may put extra stress
on your lower back.
• Use a swimmer’s snorkel.

This drill works on both kicking and body positioning. The object is to sink under-
water, achieve a streamlined position, and push off of the wall forcefully. Then start
kicking as fast as you can in order to go as far as you can underwater, keeping in
mind that of course you will need to come up for air. Remember that your body posi-
tion dictates your depth; if your head is down you will stay down, but the moment you
lift your head you will rise to the surface. Repeat this drill several times to increase
your distance traveled from the wall. Exhale in a slow, controlled fashion throughout
the movement.

Putting all of these individual skills together is the last part of the process (figure
3.6). As you can tell from the previous sections, this step has a lot of components; as
a result, you need not get frustrated if you don’t get it right on the first try. Ideally,
the fastest freestyle swimming happens with six kicks per armstroke, in which case
you are moving the lower part of your body much faster than the upper part. Try this
progression to maximize your chance for success.

to toe tips. Doing so keeps your body on the same line and prevents
that out-of-control feeling.

MissTep
Your kicking stops altogether when you breathe.
cOrrecTiOn
Slow your kicking to a two-beat kick but try to get three or four small
kicks in when you breathe; this approach helps you stay aware of
where your feet are and reminds you to keep kicking.
Here are a couple of keys to keep in mind: Your kick should not be too big. A kick that
is too big is outside of the drag shadow, which is a column of water that is moving
with you and slightly behind your leading edge. Since it is turbulent already, adding
propulsion to it will increase velocity. If your kick goes outside of this column of
moving water into nonturbulent water, any surfaces past that turbulent or nontur-
bulant interface produce more drag. Also, make sure not to stop your stroke by over-
focusing on counting your kicks; if you do have a pause in your stroke at this stage,
make sure that it occurs when both arms are out front. You are in the most stream-
lined position possible at that point. The drag is minimal compared to the profile for
every other part of the movement.
Drills FOr TiMing anD rhyThM
When you walk with good synchronization of movement, it is effortless, and you
really don’t need to think about it very much. In contrast, swimming is a less natural
movement for humans, so we have to learn how to put it all together. The following
timing-and-rhythm drills help you get a feel for when to move which body parts and
where.
Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 1 Three-Quarters catch-Up
This is a popular drill for practicing rhythm and timing. Start with the catch-up drill
described earlier in this step. Slowly start your lead hand as your other hand catches
up, until your hands are passing in front of your head rather than truly catching up.
The amount of alteration in rhythm depends on the swimmer, so repeat the drill mul-
tiple times to find out what works best for you.
TO increase DiFFicUlTy
• Perform six kicks per stroke.
• Go from catch-up to hands opposite each other (i.e., increase the turn-
over of the arm stroke) and adjust based on feel and distance.

Backstroke
The modern backstroke was introduced into international competition at the 1900 Olym-
pic Games in Paris (freestyle events were first contested at the 1896 Games). This first
appearance of what resembles the modern backstroke led to several technique changes,
as well as revised notions of how to swim the stroke most effectively. The original back-
stroke was performed with the arms straight underwater and somewhat loose on the over-
the-water recovery, almost as if it were the front crawl or freestyle turned upside down.
Later, Australian swimmers used a bent-arm pull and developed a stroke closer to what is
recognized as backstroke today.
The great advantage of backstroke over other strokes is that the swimmer’s face is out of
the water. In addition, swimmers who master the backstroke develop great balance on the
water, which also benefits their freestyle stroke. In this step, you will develop the following
skills:
• Horizontal body line
• Rotation on a long axis
• Splashless entry and effective catch
• Pressure on the water throughout the stroke
• Kicking rhythm
• Effective breathing
• Effective timing
Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective
backstroke.
A good horizontal position is a key element of an effective backstroke and also lays the
foundation for applying force to the water to achieve propulsion. As mastered in step 1
(floating on your back), the basic position involves lying on the water with your head, hips,
feet, and hands at the surface. As you remain stretched out on the water, ensure that you are
comfortable and balanced.
Basic BacksTroke
A good armstroke for the backstroke (figure 4.1) consists of four basic elements that provide
the bulk of the propulsive force in swimming: catch, pull, finish (with your palm toward
your body, not toward the bottom of the pool), and recovery. At some point when the strok-
ing arm is near vertical, rotate your hand so that your pinkie finger leads the stroke recovery.
Remember that as you work on mastering a skill, it is crucial to move in a slow, controlled
manner at first. As you may notice, kicking is not mentioned here; this does not mean that
you should not kick but simply that you should focus on the skill being described.

from your body and prevent it
from leading the pull.

MulTiple-sTroke BacksTroke
Once you have gone through one stroke cycle—one right arm and one left arm—it
is time to put together multiple stroke cycles. Unlike the “catching up” pattern of
freestyle, in backstroke your hands should always be at opposite ends of the stroke
pattern (figure 4.2).
For safety, practice this skill in a pool that is long enough for seven to ten strokes
and equipped with backstroke flags. The flags are placed 5 yards from the end of the
pool, and most swimmers can take two or three strokes after passing beneath them
before reaching the wall.

Make sure that the lane is clear and equipped with backstroke flags. Assume a bal-

the water and begin stroking with whichever arm is most comfortable for you; take
seven to ten strokes. Repeat this process several times, trying to get farther down the
pool with the same number of strokes.
MissTep
You make a lot of splashing and thrashing movements.
correcTion
Many swimmers tend to rush the arm to the top of the stroke, which
causes excessive splash. Remember that the goal here is to slow
down the armstroke in order to have a splashless entry.
MissTep
You continually pull a curtain of water into your face.
correcTion
As you finish the stroke, rotate your hip on the same side as your stroking
arm and the shoulder of your stroking arm toward the sky. This action
allows you to exit the water cleanly with your thumb first; if it is done
slowly enough, only a little water will drip off of your arm and hand.

Drills For arMsTrokes
Armstroke drills help you ensure that you perform a proper entry, catch, and pull by
isolating the movements so that you can focus on just one portion of the stroke. The
three drills presented here also help you with rotation and rhythm.
Armstroke Drill 1 six-kick switch
This drill helps you with armstrokes, balance, and timing. To perform the drill, begin
kicking on your back with both hands above your head. Turn over slightly to your
side and pull one arm down to the side. Hold your position on the side—with one
arm extended and its pinkie finger down and your other arm flat against your side—
for six kicks. Then pull again as your hands switch places. Repeat the drill for the
length of the pool.

Armstroke Drill 2 Hesitation
In this drill, you stop the recovery midway through, when your arm is out of the water
and vertical. When you stop the recovery motion, rotate your hand and then continue
the recovery, being sure that your hand enters the water pinkie first with little or no
splash. Hesitate for just a second or two—just enough to stop the motion of your arm
toward your head.

Armstroke Drill 3 Double-arm Backstroke
This is a classic drill that helps you keep your hand on the same plane as your
shoulders during the armstroke. To do it, start kicking with your hands at your sides.
Simultaneously raise both arms out of the water, with your thumbs exiting first, then
rotate your hands to enter the water pinkies first. Your hands should enter a little
more than shoulder-width apart. Bend your elbows slightly while catching the water
with your hands and pulling down toward your thighs. Make sure to finish with your
palms flat against your thighs rather than down toward the pool bottom.

toward the pool bottom.
roTaTion
Because the backstroke is driven by your legs and hips, you must use your core muscles
to turn your hip and shoulder over as one piece in order to perform an effective catch
and pull. Ideally, you get a deep, effective catch and pull by using your body for rotation
(figure 4.3) rather than “faking it” by finishing the stroke with your palm under your hip
to force the hip over. The latter approach also forces you to lift your arm all the way back to
the surface and creates extra drag. Rotation also reduces drag in another way—by reduc-
ing your cross-sectional area on the water.
In addition, rotation in the backstroke helps you keep your upper arms in line with your
collarbones; imagine a single line extending from elbow to elbow and passing straight
through your shoulders. What proper alignment through proper body rotation means for
the backstroke is that you never reach behind yourself, which is a good thing since little or
no power can be generated there. Reaching behind is similar to trying to push yourself up
out of the water with your back to the wall and your hands on the deck. You may be able to
do it if you are really strong, but the effort would lead to shoulder injury over the long run.
When doing any of these drills or skills, make sure that the backstroke flags are in place
or that you have a partner to stop you before you get to a wall.

Drills For roTaTion
The following drills help you maintain proper body and head positioning while
working on your rotation. Keep in mind that each drill may involve an overcorrec-
tion of a typical flaw; when you transition back to swimming the stroke, you can
smooth everything out to make each motion fluid.
Rotation Drill 1 shoulder roll
This position drill helps you become aware of how your hip and shoulder are con-
nected for the stroke and how to use your core muscles to drive rotation. To do the
drill, push off of the wall and begin kicking on your back with your hands at your
sides. Once you are comfortable, roll one shoulder up to your chin, making sure that
the same-side hip turns with the shoulder. Return to the neutral position on the water
and repeat with the opposite shoulder. Go through several cycles of this pattern to
ensure that you are comfortable with rotating on the long axis of your body without
sinking.
To increase DiFFiculTy
• Perform six kicks per stroke as part of the stroke mentione d in the intro-

Rotation Drill 3 slap your Thigh
This drill is more advanced than the others and strongly emphasizes rotation on the
recovery. To do it, push off of the wall on your back in a streamlined position with
your hands extended beyond your head as described in step 1. Begin a pull with
one arm, leaving the other arm in place beyond your head. As you recover the strok-
ing arm, stop when it is vertical, then bring it back down with the palm on your thigh
before initiating the recovery again—only this time recovering all the way through to
the entry. If you rotated over—as in the spine being an axis and the arc of rotation
includes the hip and shoulder together in the same plane at a fixed distance—your
hand and thigh should be at or above the water’s surface. As you begin the full
recovery, begin the same motion sequence with your other arm.

BreaTHing
Although your face is out of the water in the backstroke, you should practice a few
techniques for effective breathing as you put your backstroke together. Many swim-
mers find it effective to breathe in through the mouth and exhale through the nose.
This way, if water is drawn toward your face and falls into your mouth, you can
expel or swallow it, which most people find preferable to inhaling it through the
nose. In addition, the technique helps many swimmers with control, rhythm, and
timing. Since swimming is a rhythmic motion, synchronizing all of the motions of
the body including breathing makes for good swimming. Most people can establish
a good breathing rhythm after just a little practice.
Complete the following to practice backstroke breathing.
PreParation
1. Push off of the wall and begin your armstrokes.

Backstroke Breathing Drill Backstroke Breathing pattern
Most backstroke swimmers inhale on one armstroke and exhale on the next. They
also inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose. If you have ever gotten
water up your nose while swimming the backstroke, you know that it is not a pleasant
experience. Make sure that you have the breathing pattern down by following these
instructions.
Ensure that the lane is clear. Ensure that backstroke flags are in place. Push off
in the streamlined position. As you break the surface, exhale through your nose.
Choose which arm is your inhale arm and which is your exhale arm. Start slowly
and breathe in through your mouth on one armstroke and out through your nose on
the opposite armstroke. Experiment to find out which pattern works best for you.

kicking
When done correctly, kicking not only provides propulsive force but also helps you
with balance. The kick used for the backstroke is the flutter kick (figure 4.4). It fea-
tures alternating leg movement, and the whole leg is moved up and down to put
pressure on the water both on the downstroke and on the upstroke.
This kick is generally the same one used in freestyle swimming but with a few
minor points of difference. As in freestyle, think of each leg’s knee joint and ankle
joint as being connected by a rubber band. In this way, the kick is more likely to be
long and fluid rather than stiff and mechanical. In another pitfall, many swimmers
tend to “paw” at the water by emphasizing the downkick and neglecting the upkick
or by raising the leg too high out of the water.

correcTion
Check your feet and ankles. Are they pointed and rigid? Are they
dorsiflexed (in an L shape)? Keep the lower part of your leg loose
and think of curling your toes rather than pointing them.
Drills For kicking
To practice developing a propulsive kick, try the following drills. Remember that the
leg movements should be long and fluid.
Kicking Drill 1 kickboard
This is a good drill for developing flutter-kick basics on your back. To do it, grab the
kickboard at the bottom and extend your arms down this time. Push off of the wall
and begin flutter-kicking on your back with the kickboard down across your upper
legs. Experiment with the amplitude or size of the kick, as well as the frequency.
Only your toes should break the surface—not your knees. If you do it incorrectly or
“bicycle,” your knees will bounce off of the kickboard. In this case, remember that
you just need to have your toes touch the surface.
To increase DiFFiculTy
• Eliminate the kickboard and kick in a streamlined position.
• Kick underwater in a streamlined position.
To Decrease DiFFiculTy
• Use fins to prevent stalling and keep your ankles flexible.

Kicking Drill 2 Vertical kicking
In this drill, which requires deeper water, simply go to a treading-water position and

develop a propulsive kick that is symmetrical. You can do this drill as vertical kicking
with one hand up out of the water, then switch to having the other hand up after six
kicks.
To increase DiFFiculTy

Kicking Drill 3 shooters
This drill helps you develop both your kicking and your body positioning. To perform
the drill, sink underwater, achieve a streamlined position on your back, and push off
of the wall forcefully. Then start kicking as fast as you can in order to go as far as
you can underwater, keeping in mind that of course you will need to come up for air.
Remember that your body position dictates your depth; if your head is down you
will stay down, but the moment you lift your head or look toward your feet you will
rise to the surface. Many swimmers use a nose clip to prevent water from going up
the nose; it can also be prevented by exhaling slowly through your nose. Repeat this
drill several times to increase your distance from the wall.

Putting all of these individual skills together is the last part of the process. As you
can tell from the previous sections, this step involves a number of components; as a
result, you need not get frustrated if you don’t get it right on the first try. Generally,
the fastest backstroke swimming happens with six kicks per armstroke, in which case
you are moving the lower part of your body much faster than the upper part. Try this
progression to maximize your chance for success (figure 4.5).

Backstroke
MissTep
Your feet go really wide.
correcTion
This is a common problem when swimmers use their feet for balance
or underreach by being out too wide on the entry. Correct this mis-
step by entering at shoulder-width or maybe a little wider.
MissTep
Your kicking stops altogether, and your feet sink.
correcTion
Slow your kicking to a two-beat kick but try to get a few more kicks
in as you get more comfortable. The backstroke is a leg-driven and
hip-driven stroke, which means that rotation comes from both the
core muscles and the kick. Using you core to rotate first is key; then
add the kicking to synchronize your movements.
Here are a couple of keys to keep in mind: Your kick should not be too big. Fluid
mechanics tells us the displaced water around the body will create what is called a
drag shadow. You can think of this as a moving column of water. As the vortices are
shed off the sides and back of the body, this turbulent water will almost give you a bit
of lift when kicking force is applied. The edge of the drag shadow is at the interface
between the turbulent and nonturbulent water. Any trailing body parts extending
beyond that area act to increase the cross-sectional profile of displaced water and
increase drag as a resistive force exponentially. Also, make sure not to stop your
stroke by overfocusing on counting your kicks; if you do have a pause in your stroke
at this stage, make sure that it occurs when your arms are opposite each other.
Drills For TiMing anD rHyTHM
As with all strokes, good timing and rhythm are key elements of the backstroke.
Unlike freestyle, in which your hands pass above your head and almost “catch up” to

This timing-and-rhythm drill also works on positioning. It is the same as the freestyle

of the wall, take three strokes, and at the end of the last stroke keep your lead arm
forward as your trailing arm finishes the stroke at your thigh. Hold that position for
five kicks before taking three more strokes and repeating the same movement. The
odd number of strokes means that you will kick on different sides.

The backstroke is very similar to the freestyle in the sense that it relies a great deal on
the core. It differs mainly in being driven more by the lower core of the body rather
than being something that one can “muscle through” with just the upper body. It is
wise to have your instructor or coach record video of your swimming and evaluate
your stroke in order to ensure that you are doing what you think you are doing—and
to help you make any needed adjustments.

Breaststroke
The breaststroke has gone through many phases and holds a place in many cul-
tures around the world. Some theorize that it was originated by mimicking the
motions of a frog, though the modern version differs somewhat in terms of the
kick. In any case, it can be traced back at least to the Stone Age, when cave paintings
were made in what is now western Egypt to depict people using the stroke. The
breaststroke was also the only stroke used for the first recorded crossing of the Eng-
lish Channel by a swimmer.
There are several advantages: It is possible to breathe after every stroke, see where
you are going, and use the stroke for survival and safety once you know how to
do this stroke effectively. Though it is technically the slowest of the four competi-
tive strokes, its subtleties and nuances make it arguably the most complex as well.
Though everyone can learn to do the breaststroke—and should, since a slower vari-
ant of it is essential in swimming long distances when necessary—learning to swim
it fast takes a great deal of patience and time.
Breaststroke and butterfly are considered “short-axis” strokes but are really tim-
ing-and-rhythm strokes. Granted, you do rotate on a shorter axis (i.e., through the
chest, laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important
elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes:
• Good body position
• Effective catch
• Pressure on the water throughout the stroke
• Kicking rhythm
• Effective breathing
• Effective timing
Once you have mastered all of these components, you are well on your way to an
effective breaststroke.
The breaststroke is the only one of the four competitive strokes that derives its
propulsive force equally from the pull and the kick; therefore, you should give equal
attention to both elements. This double focus is one factor that makes the breast-
stroke so elusive for some swimmers. At any level, if you look across the race pool,
you will find a greater variety of styles being used for the breaststroke than for any
other competitive stroke. Some swimmers use a wider pull or kick, whereas others
use a quicker stroke rate and still others a longer rate. Bottom line: there is no agreed-
upon best way to do this stroke.
99

--- Page 119 Text ---
Swimming: Steps to Success
As with the other strokes, however, there are certain basic movements that pro-
vide propulsive force and minimize drag. More specifically, though it is true that
you can have a weaker kick in the freestyle or backstroke and still muscle your way
through; the same cannot be said of the breaststroke. Therefore, the first element to
focus on in the breaststroke is a good kick.
BreasTsTroke kick
The following skills and drills will help you master what is the most complex of
strokes: the breaststroke. The first of these skills is mastering the breaststroke kick
(figure 5.1).

1. Make sure the area is clear
and you have ample space
to perform the skill.

1. From the horizontal start
position, draw the heels up
toward the butt.
2. Point the feet and toes in
opposite directions away
from the midline of the body.
3. Push the heels out while
keeping the knees tucked in.

Breaststroke
MissTep
You draw the knees outside before the heels.
correcTion
Leading with the knees causes you to wedge the water with the
whole leg and places an increased stress on the hips. Instead, think
of the knees as being separated by the width of just your hands.
Alternately, placing a small buoy higher above the knees when kick-
ing during the breaststroke will accomplish the same thing.
Many swimmers experience the following problems in kicking with the breaststroke.
To avoid these common mistakes, review the drills from step 2.
• Kicking “out” as if doing a side kick rather than anchoring the instep and
pushing
• Bringing the heels up either too far or not far enough
• Kicking with the toes pointed
• Drawing out with the knees rather than keeping them in
• Keeping the legs together
• Not controlling the core and thus making the finish more of a dolphin kick
Keep these pitfalls in mind in order to avoid later problems that can result from the
lack of an effective propulsive kick.
Drills for kickinG
As mentioned in step 2 (manipulating the water), a good propulsive breaststroke
kick is all about putting pressure on the water with the legs from the knee down. For
a refresher, practice the following drills.
Kicking Drill 1 Wall kick
Begin by standing near the pool wall in water that is at least chest deep with your
back touching the wall. Starting with your right leg, draw the heel up with the knee
still touching the wall in the dorsiflexed or L position. Once your thigh is parallel to
the bottom of the pool, stop raising the leg.
While in this position, slide your heel out and away from the centerline of your
body while keeping your knee in the same place. This action may seem awkward at
first. The key is to make sure that your heel is farther from the center of your body
than your knee is. You may need to use the wall for balance.
Once your foot is in position, push the instep in a sweeping motion down toward
the bottom of the pool. You have succeeded when you can feel pressure from the
water on your instep and on the inside of your calf. Once you have succeeded with
your right foot, try this same motion with your left foot. Once you are comfortable with
this motion, try both together.

Kicking Drill 2 Moving Through the Water
Now that you feel the pressure on the water, it is time to ensure that it is propulsive
pressure by moving through the water. The next part of the progression calls for you
to lie on your back in the neutral position described in step 1 with your hands at your
sides for balance. Draw your heels up. Once your heels are close to your hips, rotate
your heels out wider than your knees and then sweep your heels together. Your
lower legs and feet should be dorsiflexed or in an L position. Squeeze your ankles
together and point your toes while finishing the kick.
Remember that these motions are more about pressure than about speed or
strength. Once you complete one kick, return to the neutral position and let your
momentum fade. Repeat the same motion until you are comfortable with it.
Important note! You will not be able to see where you are going during this drill.
Make sure that the backstroke flags in place—five yards from the wall—or have
your coach or instructor stop you when necessary!

Kicking Drill 3 kicking on your front
The next drill for building an effective breaststroke kick involves transferring the
back kick from the neutral position to the front. Remember, once your heels are close
to your hips, rotate your heels out so that they are wider than your knees, then sweep
them together. Your lower legs and feet should be dorsiflexed or in an L position.
Squeeze your ankles together and point your toes while finishing the kick. Do this
drill first with your hands at your sides for balance, then switch to a streamlined posi-
tion. Repeat the same motion until you are comfortable with it.
To increase DifficulTy
• Stay in a streamlined position.
• Place a pull buoy between your legs, slightly above mid-thigh, to ensure
that your knees stay together.

The pull
The second propulsive element of the breaststroke is the pull (figure 5.2). Unlike free-
style and backstroke, each of these movements is independent of the other; therefore,
timing is crucial. First, focus on developing a really good breaststroke catch-and-pull
phase. The difference is that the hands are not stacked one on top of the other as in
the preceding skill. The catch and the pull are two parts of the same motion. The
release from the pull position is achieved by bringing the elbows together under the
body while simultaneously moving the hands forward.
Here is an effective trick for thinking about these movements together. Imagine
that you are scraping cake batter out of a bowl with your pinkie fingers, then pushing
it to someone else. Your hands accelerate throughout the catch-and-pull phase until
reaching the neutral position again. Your hands should never go past your shoulders.
If they do, you will have to bring them forward, making a propulsive movement in
a direction opposite of the way you are swimming. You will then have to start again
after this motion makes you stop, thus requiring more energy to accelerate.

MissTep
You pull too wide with your elbows straight and your palms out.

Remember to pitch your fingers down and catch the water. Sweep
out as if using a sculling motion, but here the goal is to wrap your
fingers down and use your palm to put pressure on the water.
MissTep
Your hands come past your shoulders.
correcTion
Think of releasing the water earlier or even touching your elbows
together under your chest. Doing so helps ensure that your hands do
not come past your shoulders on the pull.
Drills for BreasTsTroke pull
The pull in the breaststroke is just as important as the kick—and more important
for some swimmers who are not as good at the kick portion. To develop an effective
pull, it is helpful to isolate this part of the overall stroke. More specifically, the pitch
of your hand and your elbow positioning are just as important here as they are in the
other strokes. The elbows-up position allows you to pull with more than just your
hand. Use the following drills to develop a pull with good propulsive force.
Pull Drill 1 Breaststroke pull With freestyle kick
This drill isolates the pull by using an easier kick and alleviating timing concerns.
To perform the drill, lie on your front and kick freestyle with your hands out front. For
every six kicks, perform one breaststroke pull.
To increase DifficulTy
• Kick faster—eight times or more per stroke.
To Decrease DifficulTy
• Use fins to prevent stalling.
• Use a pull buoy and do not kick at all.

BreaThinG
One of the many advantages of the breaststroke is that you can breathe on every
stroke. The exact timing of this breath is an important part of the rhythm of the breast-
stroke (figure 5.3). As a result, before you start to put it all together for a complete
breaststroke, it is a good idea to practice your breathing in isolation. While perform-
ing the following drills, lift your head to breathe; the key is to do so at the right time
and in the right manner. With the other pressures of laminar flow of water against
the chest providing lift on the water, this movement should be sufficient to get your
mouth and nose out of the water. Some swimmers will be higher and others lower; it
is very specific to each swimmer.

Breathing in the breaststroke is really a study in keeping that balanced developed in
the first few steps. You know from earlier steps that head position is important. The
following drills will help you establish a good head position and help with breathing.
Breathing Drill Tennis Ball 2
This drill helps you maintain proper head position while going to get air or breathing
in breaststroke. To perform the drill, place a tennis ball beneath your chin and hold
it to your chest. This action keeps your neck in line and prevents you from coming
up too high when you breathe. Swim the regular breaststroke and try breathing both
earlier in the stroke and later in the stroke to find out which works best for you. Avoid
pushing down on the water with your palms.

TiMinG anD rhyThM
Timing is crucial in both the breaststroke and the butterfly but is most important in
the breaststroke. To work on your timing, you can use a few simple drills that empha-
size it. The secret to the breaststroke hinges on the fact that half of its propulsive force
comes from the kick and the other half from the pull. The key is not to do both at the
same time. The proper rhythm is one kick, one pull and breath, and a return to the
stretched-out position.

Because propulsion in the breaststroke derives equally from the kick and the pull,
it is crucial to maximize the efficiency of each element. Get it wrong and you end
up being very slow. The key is to make sure that you do not kick when pulling and
vice versa. The following drills include some overcorrections of typical problems
but should help you separate the two movements so that you can develop a good
rhythm.
Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 1 Two-hippopotamus Breaststroke
This is a slow drill that helps you with your timing. It is performed by pushing off of
the wall in the streamlined position. Do one breaststroke kick, then wait while count-
ing “one hippopotamus . . . two hippopotamus.” Next, pull and breathe as described
earlier and shoot forward before kicking again. This approach teaches the indepen-
dent movements of the arms and legs.

Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 2 Two kicks per stroke
This classic breaststroke drill increases your awareness of timing and body posi-
tion; it also helps you with balance. It is performed by simply kicking twice in the
stretched-out position with your hands far forward (but not on top of each other)
and kicking twice per catch–pull sequence. Keep your head down with a long neck
during each pair of kicks.

BreasTsTroKe PullouT
The modern breaststroke is done with what is referred to as a pullout (figure 5.4),
both at the start and during each turn at the wall. To perform the pullout, the swim-
mer pushes off the wall underwater (or starts from a dive) in a streamlined position.
As the hands separate, they can pull all the way down to the hips just once. The
swimmer is allowed to perform one dolphin kick at any time in this part. As the
swimmer slows, the hands are brought up the body and close to the body to get into
a breast stroke swimming position with the hands out in front. It is at this point that
the stroke as described earlier actually begins.

The breaststroke is unique in that about half of its propulsion derives from the kick
and the rest derives from the pull. As a result, the stroke is highly rhythmic, and in
order to do it well you need the lower half of your body to work independently of
the upper half. This dynamic involves give and take, and there are many effective
styles of breaststroke. One thing, however, is true for them all: If your timing is off,
you spend a lot of energy going very slowly—or going nowhere fast.

If you scored at least 32 points, then you have completed this step. If you scored 33

Butterfly
The butterfly is the fourth of the competitive strokes recognized in international
competition. It was developed in the 1930s as a way to minimize the drag caused
by underwater recovery of the arms in the breaststroke. Early variants of the
butterfly (referred to as the butterfly breaststroke) used an over-the-water recovery
with a breaststroke kick. This technique was much faster than the breaststroke but
required a great deal of strength. It was not until the 1950s that the butterfly was con-
sidered a separate stroke from breaststroke, and the use of a dolphin kick was added
to the official competition rules governing the new stroke.
As mentioned in step 5, the butterfly, like the breaststroke, is considered a “short-
axis” stroke but is really a timing-and-rhythm stroke. It does involve rotating on a
shorter axis (i.e., through the chest, laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the
spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common
to all of the strokes:
• Good body position
• Effective catch
• Pressure on the water throughout the stroke
• Acceleration throughout the stroke
• Kicking rhythm
• Effective breathing
• Effective timing
Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective
butterfly.
The basic motion of the butterfly involves an undulating rhythm in which the legs
and arms are synchronized by precise timing. The most important element of a good
butterfly stroke is the use of the body’s core, which is the greatest source of power.
Here are the basic movements as you flow through the stroke. From the neutral
position described in step 1—facedown in the water with your arms stretched out
above your head—press your chest down toward the pool bottom. To help you do
so, you can use a downward motion of your feet with your legs together in a dol-
phin-kick downstroke.
Next, push your hips down while arching your back to bring your head and
chest back toward the surface. Again, you are encouraged to use your legs in a dol-
phin-kick upstroke; you should feel some pressure on the backs of your legs and the
bottoms of your feet. You use the dolphin kick here both to provide propulsive force
and to manipulate the position of your center of buoyancy to produce an undulating
motion.
115

--- Page 135 Text ---
Swimming: Steps to Success
As you complete the undulating and kicking motion, pitch your fingers down
toward the bottom of the pool and bend at the elbows in a motion similar to that of
pushing yourself up out of the pool. Once your hands and forearms are close to verti-
cal, push back while accelerating your hands and arms. The propulsive force of your
hands and forearms—along with a slight forward push of your chin—causes you to
rise out of the water high enough to get a breath.
The last element involves acceleration of your hands past your hips and out of the
water. With your head and shoulders out of the water, a forceful movement of your
hands at the finish allows you to recover your arms in a straight fashion. The arms
remain straight rather than bent over and parallel to the surface of the water. The
entry of your hands and arms should be above your head in front of your shoulders,
if not a little wider, thus returning you to your original neutral position to begin the
next stroke cycle.
You will practice each of these elements in the following sections, which include
drills to help you master each element and culminate in a discussion of putting it all
together.
Dolphin KicK
Unlike the flutter kick, the dolphin kick derives its power from the middle part of
your core—from the lower part of your rib cage down through your pelvis. In addi-
tion, your legs stay together the whole time. The basic motion involves driving your
hips back and forth with the strong muscles of your core and using your legs merely
to finish off the kick. Your legs should be long and loose; let your strong core muscles
initiate most of the work.
A good mental image for this kick is the motion of a dolphin or whale. Try to
mimic that motion with your body, from your chest on down. Some swimmers also
find it helpful to imagine that their legs are glued together and cannot be separated.
In this step, you will work on the following skills:
1. Developing a propulsive and symmetrical kick
2. Laying your hands on the water and achieving a good catch position
3. Getting from the catch to the pull and making sure that the force is applied
in the correct direction
4. Accelerating your hands through the pull
5. Synchronizing the kick and the pull
6. Effective breathing
7. Recovery of the arms
Dolphin Kick With Face Out of Water
The key here is to sustain a steady rhythmic kick (don’t think about speed just yet)
that feels like you are putting pressure on the water all the way down your leg.
Remember to start the kick with your core and move fluidly down through your legs.
Once you have mastered this motion (figure 6.1), it is time to move on to the next part
of the progression.

propulsive. Assume the same extended streamlined position that you developed in

Dolphin Kick With Kickboard
Once again, this part (figure 6.3) of the progression ensures that your kick is indeed
propulsive. If you come to a stop or even go backward, repeat the hands-to-toes
check for correct positioning. Many swimmers come to the pool with a limited range
of motion in their ankles. Make sure that your ankles are slightly plantar-flexed so
that your toes point away from your body, but not so much as to make your legs
rigid.
When you need to breathe, simply apply pressure to the kickboard and lift your
head for air. Make this motion quick in order to maintain your balance in the water
and get your face back in the water to stabilize your balance.

Dolphin Kick Without Kickboard
Once you have mastered the skill with the kickboard, it is time once again to put
your propulsive kicking force to the test. Repeat the process just described, but this
time do it without the assistance of the kickboard (figure 6.4). The goal is to kick in a
streamlined position. If you were able to do so with a kickboard, then this transition
should be a little easier. The new challenge here is that when you breathe, you should
use the same sculling motion described earlier in step 2: Simply sweep your hands
out and in rhythmically to apply enough pressure on the water to allow you to lift
your head for a quick breath. Once you have mastered this technique—and it may
take a few tries—it is time to move to dolphin kicking on your back.

Dolphin Kick on Your Back
Dolphin kicking on the back (figure 6.5) differs only slightly from kicking on the
front. The upstroke of the kick is propulsive, whereas the downstroke is used to
propel the arms in the recovery and entry. Once again, it is helpful to develop an
effective mental image. As with kicking on your front, imagine the joints of each leg
being connected by a rubber band; staying long and loose is still a key. This mental
image helps you apply pressure in the right places and recruit the proper muscles.

Drills For Dolphin KicKing
Once you have mastered the basic movement, continue to develop your technique.
Many swimmers start off stiff and mechanical in their kicking rhythm; with practice,
however, they develop a smoother and much more propulsive kick. Here are a few
drills to help you master this skill.
Dolphin Kicking Drill 1 Vertical Kicking
After you have achieved propulsion in dolphin kicking, work on kicking both up and
down. This drill helps you develop a symmetrical kick. Find water deep enough to be
over your head, then begin by treading water with your head out and using a flutter
kick. Once you are comfortable, switch to a dolphin kick.
The goal here is to remain stationary in the water without making much use of
your hands. If you kick more forcefully in one direction, you will drift around in the
pool. Staying in place, on the other hand, means that you are putting pressure on
the water with both the fronts and the backs of your legs. You should feel the pres-
sure most on the tops and bottoms of your feet, since they are the body parts that
finish off the kick.
To increase DiFFiculTY
• Do not use your hands at all for balance.
• Put your hands on top of your head.
• Raise your hands straight above you in a streamlined position.
To Decrease DiFFiculTY
• Use fins.
• Use a kickboard.

your body, it is time to start working on
applying this force in a horizontal rather
than a vertical direction.
Dolphin Kicking Drill 2 Kick on Your Back
This drill helps you continue to develop a symmetrical kick. Now that you feel the
pressure on the water, it is time to ensure that it is propulsive pressure by moving
through the water. The next part of the progression for an effective dolphin kick is to
lie on your back in the neutral position described in step 1 with your hands at your
sides for balance.
Begin dolphin-kicking with special emphasis on the pressure on the bottoms of
your feet. As with the backstroke flutter kick, keep your knees underwater; do not
just “push” at the water with the tops of your feet. Some swimmers find it beneficial
to think of curling the toes in order to feel the feet in a stretched-out position while
keeping the ankles loose.
Important note! You will not be able to see where you are going during this drill.
Make sure that the backstroke flags are in place—5 yards from the wall—or have
your coach or instructor stop you when necessary!
To increase DiFFiculTY
• Place a kickboard across the upper part of your legs to prevent your
upper legs from coming out of the water.
• Raise your arms above your head and perform the drill in a streamlined
position.
To Decrease DiFFiculTY
• Use two kickboards—one in each hand—for balance.
• Use a slight sculling motion to provide a little propulsion at the same
time.
• Use fins.

kick from the neutral position to the front. Squeeze your ankles together and point
your toes while finishing the kick. Do this drill first with your hands at your sides for
balance, then switch to a streamlined position. Repeat the same motion until you are
comfortable with it.

BuTTerFlY arMsTroKe
Since its inception, the butterfly armstroke (figure 6.6) has been taught in many
ways. In the early years, many instructors advocated an outsweep of the hands and a
movement in a keyhole fashion. Later variants included an insweep, as well making
almost a figure-eight pattern. The modern butterfly uses more of a straight pull with
the maximum amount of arm area perpendicular to the direction in which you are
going.

Drills For BuTTerFlY arM MoVeMenT
When you watch accomplished butterfly swimmers, you see the recovery, but the
real magic happens underwater. That is where the positioning of the hands, elbows,
forearms, and shoulders really comes into play. When doing the following drills,
remember that you are not pushing down but pulling forward.
Butterfly Arm Movement Drill 1 Wall press
This drill teaches you the correct catch and pull through the armstroke. To per-
form the drill, get in the pool in water that is over your head. Place your hands at
least shoulder-width apart on the pool deck and submerge until your arms are fully
extended. Once you have achieved this position, apply pressure to your hands and
pull yourself toward the surface. Once at the surface, continue the motion until you
are halfway out of the water with your arms extended to your hips. Repeat this drill
until you can do it with your eyes closed.
To increase DiFFiculTY
• Start at the bottom of the pool, extend your arms up, and place them on
the deck after they break the surface.
To Decrease DiFFiculTY

and press all the way up.
5 points: You can perform the drill five
times in deep water without fins.
7 points: You can perform the drill from
the bottom in deep water five times or
more.
Butterfly Arm Movement Drill 2 sneaky hands
This drill allows you to focus only on the catch and pull. Begin by lying on the water
facedown in the neutral position with your legs together and your arms extended
over your head. Separate each motion into a distinct movement as you pitch your
fingers down, rotate your elbows up, and push through to finish with your hands past
your hips. Accelerate your hands through the entire movement.
126

--- Page 146 Text ---
Butterfly
Once you have completed the movement, your hands are at your thighs and you
are moving forward. Now, sneak your hands back up along your body, keeping your
elbows in until you are at the first position, then repeat. This is very similar to the
breaststroke pullout.
To increase DiFFiculTY
• Once you are comfortable with this drill, add one dolphin kick prior to
moving your hands back and another after finishing the pull at your
thighs.

BuTTerFlY arM recoVerY
Many swimmers struggle with arm recovery (figure 6.7) if they perform the pull
incorrectly. It is easy for the arms to recover over the water if the hands accelerate
through the stroke and finish at or slightly wider than the hips. The reason is that the
momentum of the stroke carries the hands through the exit, which means that less
effort is required to bring the arms and hands back to the forward position.
The key is to finish the stroke fast and feather the hands so that they exit the water
smoothly, pinkies out first. If the stroke is finished with an acceleration, the forward
movement of the arms requires less effort. It should be done in the same position:
little fingers up, thumbs down, and forearms and upper arms parallel to the water.
The specifics of how the hands enter the water are matters of style. Some swimmers
do it thumb first, whereas others rotate the wrists before entry. Regardless of style,
one must ensure that the fingers are down as described in the catch-and-pull phase.
Therefore, if you use the thumbs-first option, make sure to rotate your fingers and
hands to be perpendicular to the direction in which you are traveling.

The most important part of the recovery is to accelerate your hands at the finish
of the stroke. If this movement is done with great force, your hands and arms will
recover almost by themselves. If you find yourself struggling to get your hands out
of the water, check your positioning and practice the following drills.
Butterfly Arm Recovery Drill 1 Dolphin Dive
This classic drill helps you get used to the undulating motion and provides buoyant
force support while you coordinate the over-the-water recovery. To perform it, stand
in waist-deep water with your hands at your sides, then bend at the waist so that
your chest is in the water but your shoulders are out. Your chin should touch the
water as you look at a spot 8 to 10 inches (20-25 cm) in front of your face.
Next, rotate your hands—so that your pinkies are up and your thumbs down—
and sweep them forward over the water; near the beginning of the movement, put
your face in the water. Now place your hands in the water in front of your shoulders
or slightly wider. Push yourself forward off of the bottom and stretch out on the water
while pushing your chest and your hips down toward the bottom. This is the same
kicking motion described earlier. Pull yourself forward and, when your hands reach
your hips, stop and stand up. Repeating this drill causes an undulating motion that
serves as the basis for your stroke and allows you time to isolate the recovery por-
tion of the stroke.

Swimming: Steps to Success
Butterfly Arm Recovery Drill 2 arm sweep
This drill incorporates the motions of kicking and pulling without the over-the-water
recovery. As in the Sneaky Hands drill, you perform all elements of the stroke, except
that when you finish the stroke you sweep your hands and arms forward and out to
the sides, near the surface of the water but still in it.
Start with your hands and arms extended out front and lie on the water in the
neutral position. Do a dolphin kick, both up and down, as well as a catch and pull.
As you finish the pull, sweep your hands and arms out in a semicircular motion with
your arms straight. It is okay for your arms to skim the surface of the water. When
your hands reach the front, stop and stand up to reset the stroke. When performing
this drill, keep your arms straight and lead with your thumbs while in the water. This
technique helps with body positioning so you do not get the body too vertical.
To increase DiFFiculTY
• Once you are comfortable with this drill, add one dolphin kick prior to
moving your hands back and another one after finishing the pull at your

BreaThing
The timing of the breath is critical to a good butterfly stroke. As with the breast-
stroke, breathing at the wrong time during the butterfly stroke cycle not only slows
the stroke but also increases the rate of fatigue. However, whereas mistimed breath-
ing in the breaststroke mainly makes you slow, mistimed breathing in the butterfly
exhausts you and forces you to stop.
130

--- Page 150 Text ---
Butterfly
To learn when to breathe and how to do so with proper technique, you use a few
simple mental cues and drills (figure 6.8). The first cue addresses how high to rise out
of the water when getting air. Rising too high reduces momentum and undulation.
As a corrective, think of pushing your chin forward rather than lifting your head.
The next concern is the timing of your breathing. Many swimmers breathe late.
To avoid this pitfall, initiate the forward chin movement as you start your pull and
make it a quick breath. How often you breathe depends on your individual needs
and development as a swimmer. Conventional wisdom used to recommend breath-
ing on every other stroke and leaving your face in the water rather than getting air
on each stroke. However, after several Olympians chose to breathe either on every
stroke or in a one-two pattern, it became apparent that butterfly swimmers should
breathe as often as they need to—but not more.

Many swimmers lift the head and then drop it back down, almost as
if nodding or bobbing for apples. The problem here is that when the
head goes up, the hips sink.
correcTion
Remember not to lift your head but instead to push your chin for-
ward. The flow of water against your chest will give you some lift.
MissTep
You breath too late, and your hips sink.
correcTion
Initiate your breathing as soon as you start the pull. Your face should
go back into the water as your arms recover. If you see your hands,
it is too late.
Butterfly Breathing Drill Dolphin-Dive sneak-a-Breath
This drill involves lying on the water and performing a catch and pull along with the
kicking motion from the first drills. As you start the pull, push your chin forward to get
air. With your hands still at your thighs, place your face back in the water and sneak
your hands forward beneath you.

Timing is crucial in both the breaststroke and the butterfly, but especially in the but-
terfly; if your timing is off, you go slow and wear out fast. Here is a brief review of
how the butterfly rhythm works (discussed earlier at the beginning of this step).

fingers down and your elbows up while pushing your chin forward. Pull through
and accelerate your hands while coming up for air. Flip your hands and arms out,
down past your hips, and around in a sweeping motion while also placing your face
back in the water and kicking down again.
Drills For TiMing anD rhYThM
Here are a few simple drills that you can do to emphasize timing.
Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 1 1-2-3-4-5 Butterfly
This drill separates the propulsive movements. Perform each distinct movement
described in the summary of butterfly rhythm, waiting one or two seconds between
movements. As you get more comfortable with the movements and with the timing,
reduce the wait interval until you are swimming the full-stroke butterfly. Breathe on
every stroke if necessary and less often if possible.
To do the drill, lie facedown on the water in the neutral position with your hands in
front. Then implement the five elements referred to in the numbers of the drill name
(1-2-3-4-5 Butterfly): (1) push your chest down, (2) push your hips down and your
chest up, (3) pitch your fingers down, (4) pull through, and (5) recover. The idea
here is to slow the movements into separate and distinct actions. You can speed up
as you become more comfortable with the rhythm.

Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 2 Four Kicks per stroke
This drill is designed to help you optimize your hand entry and maintain a good line
of the body in the water. To do it, perform one pull for every four dolphin kicks. This
technique isolates your hand positioning upon entry and immediately afterward. Lay
your hands on the water directly in front of you so that your arms are above the
head in an outstretched position like that of Superman when flying. Perform four
dolphin kicks to continue moving forward while adjusting your hands and arms if
necessary.
If you find yourself having to lift your head and pitch your hands up to get back
to the stretched-out position, you are driving the stroke too much with your upper
body. Instead, think of laying your hands on the water and landing on your armpits.
Remember to breathe only in the beginning part of the stroke.

Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 3 3-3-3
This drill comes in several versions. One of the most effective approaches goes as
follows: Do three strokes with only your right arm while your left arm is out front; do
three strokes with only your left arm while your right arm is out front; and then swim
three full strokeswith both arms together. The timing of the drill is key.
Unlike the freestyle one-arm, this drill requires you to remain flat; that is, your hips
must stay flat rather than rotating from side to side. Use your extended (nonstroking)
arm for balance. Also be sure to breathe to your front, not to your side as you would
in freestyle.

Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 4 3-up-3-Down
This drill addresses both breaststroke and butterfly. To do it, simply perform three
breaststroke strokes followed by three butterfly strokes. The key is to maintain the
rhythm and undulation that characterize both strokes. One variant of this drill involves
doing the breaststroke pull and dolphin kick during the breaststroke part; another
involves breathing only in the breaststroke portion. This drill allows you to concen-
trate on the rhythmic aspect of the strokes.

Like the breaststroke, the butterfly is very rhythmic. The fluidity and efficiency of the
stroke are hard to judge without looking at it from a coach’s perspective or seeing it
on video. The skills and drills outlined in this chapter teach you the basic elements
of butterfly, which is widely regarded as the most difficult stroke to master. For this
reason, be patient and do not skip any of the component skills; you need to have each
skill in place in order to put it all together in the end.

Turns
You need to be able to perform an effective turn in both competitive and recre-
ational pool swimming. In competition, an effective turn saves race time when
changing direction. For recreational and fitness swimmers, an effective turn
maximizes your workout time and enhances your proficiency in the water. Every
turn, regardless of the type, consists of four key elements:
1. Approach
2. Exchange
3. Streamline
4. Breakout
The approach involves where, when, and how you prepare for the turn. The
exchange is the point at which you transfer momentum from one direction to the
opposite direction. The streamline is performed when you push off of the wall, and
the breakout is where you transition from streamlining to swimming a stroke. In this
step, you learn how to perform the most basic turn for recreational swimming, as
well as the most advanced turns and transitions used in competitive swimming.
Open Turn
The most basic and functional turn is the open turn. It was used in early freestyle
competitions, as well as backstroke competitions, and is a favorite among recrea-
tional swimmers. In this turn, the approach (figure 7.1) is made on the front, and in
competition pools it can be gauged by markings on the pool bottom. Specifically,
the centerline of each lane has a T shape close to the wall that provides competitive
swimmers with a target. When swimming in a pool without this kind of marking,
you can take a quick look to judge distance by lifting your head out of the water.
Many pools also have a spillover gutter system or a low coping that allows you to
grasp the wall with your hands.

Turns
The next phase of the turn involves the push-off and streamline (figure 7.2). This is
a critical part of good swimming; in fact, other than a start or dive, this is the fastest
that you can move the in water without some sort of aid. As in step 1, the push-off
here should be forceful; in addition, since you are on your side, you need to rotate to
the correct position during the streamline. Make sure that you are underwater and
parallel to the pool bottom and the surface of the water.
Another key here lies in the fact that your head position controls your depth on
the streamline. If you keep your chin and head down, you maintain constant depth.
If you lift your head or push your chin forward, you rise toward the surface. Experi-
ment with how long your streamline should be for best results.

Swimming: Steps to Success
The last part of the turn is the breakout (figure 7.3), which is your transition from
the streamlined position to a swimming position. In freestyle swimming, simply
push your chin forward. Please note that you should not necessarily lift your head;
instead, bring your chin forward, which causes you to rise to the surface gradually. In
contrast, lifting your head causes you to become more vertical, thus losing momen-
tum and slowing down.

Open Turn fOr BacksTrOke
You can also use an open turn with the backstroke, even in competition (figure 7.4).
For safety reasons, you should practice this technique only in a pool equipped with
backstroke flags. As mentioned in the backstroke step, these are placed 5 yards from
the end of the pool. Swimmers also count strokes from the flags to get to the wall, and
for many swimmers it takes about three strokes.

As you approach on your back, roll toward your side, as in freestyle. Make sure
not to go past vertical with your shoulders; that is, remain slightly on your back. The
exchange is the same as in freestyle, and the streamline is similar except that you
push off slightly on your back. The streamline is faceup, and the breakout is the same
as before except this time of course transitioning into the backstroke.

DriLLs fOr Open Turns
The open turn is a great turn to learn first because it is often used by fitness swim-
mers. In addition, until the 1960s, it was used by distance swimmers in competition
to get more oxygen during turns. The following drills help you master the elements
of the turn.
Open Turn Drill 1 approach
To perform this drill, get in water that is about 3 to 4 feet (1 m) deep. Position your-
self two or three yards away from the wall and start by pushing off of the bottom in a
streamlined position. Take one freestyle stroke, rotate to your nonstroking side, and
reach for the wall. Let your momentum carry you and attend closely to the pool mark-
ings. Grab the gutter or coping and pull yourself forward slightly. Try both sides—
you will find one more comfortable and easier than the other. Adjust your distance
from the wall as needed.
TO increase DifficuLTY
• Start farther from the wall and take multiple strokes prior to the touch
and grab.
TO Decrease DifficuLTY
• Start closer to the wall and just push off and glide on one side without
taking a stroke.

Open Turn Drill 2 Exchange
Once you have mastered drill 1, it is time to work on the exchange. Stand in water
that is about 3 to 4 feet (1 m) deep and position yourself about one arm’s length from
the side of the pool. If the pool’s design permits, grab the gutter with either hand and
turn sideways so that your side, rather than your front, faces the wall. If you can’t
grab the gutter, grab the coping or deck. Point your other arm down the length of the
pool underwater. Drive your knees toward your chest and rotate your feet to the wall
about 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) underwater. You are now on your side and tucked,
with your feet on the wall and one arm pointing down the length of the pool. Sink and
touch your hands together so that you are on your side underwater. Do not push; the
idea here is to get comfortable in the proper position for pushing effectively.
To IncrEasE DIffIculTy
• Make sure that your hand leaves the wall before your feet touch, then
hold the wall position for three to five seconds.
• Raise your hands straight above you in a streamlined position.

Swimming: Steps to Success
Open Turn Drill 3 Side-to-Front Streamline
Once you have mastered drill 2, it is time to work on the streamline and push. This
drill is performed in three stages. In the first stage, push off of the wall in a stream-
lined position with your head down to control depth. The key is to push off forcefully
and go as far as you can. Find markers in the pool or use another means to deter-
mine where you come up each time. This is only a push and a streamline—no kick-
ing or other movements. In the second stage, glide as far as you can. In the third,
rotate from the side to the front while gliding and using only body control. Since you
are on your side for the open turn, practice rotating from the side to the front several
times. Do the same for the backstroke (rotating to the back).
To IncreaSe DIFFIculTy
• Combine this drill with the approach and exchange drills.

flags—that is, 5 yards—with no
body movement before surfacing. 7 points: You can go 12 yards.
Open Turn Drill 4 1-2-3 Streamlines
This drill is also performed in three phases. The first phase is the push, and the
second is the kicking. These phases are closely linked; there should be little or no
gliding prior to getting into your kicking rhythm. The third phase involves pushing
your chin forward to initiate the breakout. Each of these three elements constitutes
a separate skill that must be put in place with good timing. Use trial and error to
determine how many kicks to perform and when to break the surface. Practice this
drill on both your front and your back, using both the flutter kick and the dolphin kick.
To IncreaSe DIFFIculTy
• Combine this drill with the approach and exchange drills.

Open Turn Drill 5 Three-stroke spin
The purpose of this drill is to maintain the momentum that you generate by pushing
off of the wall. After you have done the drills listed already and mastered them, it is
time to finish the turn, which means transitioning from streamlining to swimming. This
drill is performed by pushing off and getting into a kicking rhythm, then pushing your
chin forward to rise to the surface and taking three fast strokes—almost like spinning
your arms. Many swimmers lose momentum during the breakout, and it is important
to maintain as much velocity as you can. Practice this drill with varying streamline
lengths. Stop after just three strokes. Try it for both freestyle and backstroke using
both flutter and dolphin kicks.

TwO-hanD TOuch Turn
The two-hand touch turn is the one used in competition and recreational swimming
for both the breaststroke and the butterfly. To perform this turn, the approach (figure
7.5) is made on the front, and in competition pools it can be gauged by markings on
the pool bottom. Specifically, the centerline of each lane has a T shape close to the
wall that provides competitive swimmers with a target. Since both the breaststroke
147

--- Page 167 Text ---
Swimming: Steps to Success
and the butterfly are forward-looking strokes, you can also easily sneak a peek at
your distance from the wall. Many pools also have a spillover gutter system or a low
coping that allows you to grasp the wall with your hands. This technique reduces
your length and thus the resistance during your turn and causes your feet to come
up close to the wall for the exchange.

It is better to be long on the turn than short. In breaststroke competi-
tion, the drag is increased and slows you down, and the pull must
also be followed by a kick, according to current rules. This could
lead to a disqualification, so it is preferable to glide to the wall.

During the exchange (figure 7.6), your body rotates and you draw one arm back
toward the other end of the pool and then extend your hand. This motion causes
your body to transition from being breast-down to being on your side. As in the open
turn, as you rotate your feet to the wall, your other hand goes over your head and
meets the first hand underwater to complete this part of the turn.

The next phase of the turn involves the push-off and streamline (figure 7.7). As in
step 1, the push-off here should be forceful; in addition, since you are on your side,
you need to rotate to the correct position during the streamline. Also as before, your
head position controls your depth on the streamline.

The last part of the turn is the breakout (figure 7.8), in which you transition from
the streamlined position to a swimming position. For the butterfly and breaststroke,
the first movement is the kick, so you will need to be near the surface. To get there,
simply push your chin forward. Please note that you should not necessarily lift your
head; instead, bring your chin forward, which causes you to rise to the surface grad-
ually. As in all of these breakouts, make sure to be neither too shallow nor too deep.

Concentrate on each movement separately in order to master them and build a highly
effective turn. The key is to get on and off of the wall quickly with no energy wasted.
With this goal in mind, the best turners avoid having their feet and their hands on
the wall at the same time. Work toward that goal as you practice the following drills.

Swimming: Steps to Success
Two-Hand Touch-Turn Drill 1 approach
Both the breaststroke and the butterfly are based on good timing and rhythm, and
this holds true for the turn. One of the ways to practice being ready for the turn is to
make sure you that are aware of your location as you approach. To do this drill, start
5 to 10 yards from the wall. Push off of the bottom and begin kicking toward the wall
to get a feel for the rhythm of your approach. Touch the wall with both hands about
shoulder-width apart.
Now, try the drill again, but this time add one or two armstrokes. Adjust your
distance until you have a good feel for your momentum and your location relative to
the wall. Elite swimmers do this drill countless times to avoid being short or long on
the turn.

Two-Hand Touch-Turn Drill 2 Tall-small-Tall exchange
This drill helps you understand how your momentum is exchanged in the two-hand
touch turn. It is performed by swimming either the breaststroke or the butterfly from
10 yards out. Gear your approach to be long and tall coming into the wall while
paying close attention to the markings on the bottom of the pool. Once your hands
touch, bend your elbows to allow your momentum to carry you into the wall while
driving your knees to your chest; make yourself as small as possible. After your feet
get to the wall, push off and make yourself tall again with a tight streamline.

hand-Touch side-to-front streamline
This drill is performed in four stages. Before you begin, position yourself with your
head, knees, and toes up. Get one arm down in the water and pointing toward the
end the pool and the other arm on the gutter. Next, release your gutter hand, stab it
over your head to meet your other hand, and sink.
The second stage involves pushing off of the wall in a streamlined position with
your head down to control depth. The key here is to push off forcefully and go as
far as you can. Find markers in the pool or use another means to determine where
you come up each time. This is only a push and a streamline—no kicking or other
movements.
In the third stage, glide as far as you can. In the fourth, rotate from the side to the
front while gliding and using only body control, then initiate the kick. Since you are
on your side for the turn, practice rotating from the side to the front several times.

Two-Hand Touch-Turn Drill 4 Two-stroke sprint Breakout
After you have mastered the preceding drills, it is time to finish the turn by making a
transition from streamlining to swimming. The purpose of this drill is to maintain the
momentum you generated by pushing off of the wall. Many swimmers lose momen-
tum during the breakout, and it is important to maintain as much velocity as you can.
This drill is performed by pushing off and either getting into a kicking rhythm for
the butterfly or initiating a kick for the breaststroke. Next, push your chin forward
to rise to the surface, then take two quick strokes. Practice this drill with varying
streamline lengths to see what is most comfortable and efficient and stop after two
strokes. Do the drill with both the butterfly and the breaststroke.

fLip Turn
The flip turn (figure 7.9) is used most commonly in freestyle and backstroke competi-
tion but is also widely used by recreational and fitness swimmers. Though competitors
initially used the open turn, the flip turn has proven to be faster and more efficient.
As with the other two turns, the flip turn involves four key elements. The approach
in the flip turn differs from the approach in the other two turns. The exchange involves
changing the position of your head and feet; in fact, you are faceup to the surface of
the water, a position in which many people experience water flowing into the nose.
This annoyance can be prevented by using a nose clip or by exhaling slowly through
the nose throughout the turn.
The streamline and breakout in the flip turn are the same as in the open turn. The
backstroke is a little more complicated, but the movement is the same. After you swim
under the backstroke flags and take three strokes, roll over onto your front and per-
form the same freestyle turn. The streamline is on the back with no roll to the front.

DriLLs fOr fLip Turn
Many swimmers misconceive the flip turn as simply a somersault that is easy to
perform. There is, of course, more to it. A successful flip turn depends on keeping
your hands stationary and using your core for the turn. The following drills help you
keep your core engaged and avoid relying on your hands and arms to manipulate
the water.
Flip-Turn Drill 1 kickboard
The purpose of this drill is to keep your hands in the same place while doing the flip
turn. To perform the drill, hold the bottom of a kickboard in each hand. Starting in the
middle of the pool, lie on the water facedown with your hands and the kickboards at
your sides and your palms and thumbs up. Tuck your chin to your chest and give a
little dolphin kick while you bend at the waist. Throw your feet over so that you end
up faceup at the top of the water with your arms above your head.

Flip-Turn Drill 2 Lane Line
This drill accustoms you to bending at the waist and using your hips as the pivot
point for the exchange. To do the drill, lie facedown across a lane line with your arms
extended over your head; position yourself so that the lane line crosses your chest
at armpit level. Next, pull both hands down to your thighs and tuck your chin to your
chest while reaching for your toes over the lane line. This action pulls you forward
over the lane line; when your hips reach the line, initiate the flip. Throw your feet over
while bending your legs slightly. Finish in the same position, lying on your back, as
in the previous drill.

Flip-Turn Drill 3 flags in
This drill helps you determine your ideal turn distance from the wall. Turn too soon
and you miss the wall with your feet altogether. Turn too late and you’re left scrunched
up and unable to get a good push—or, worse, you hit your heels on the deck or
gutter. To perform the drill, start in shallow water right at the backstroke flags. Push
forward and take one stroke before initiating the turn. Pay careful attention to the
markings on the pool bottom. Repeat this drill by adding a stroke each time until you
find the right spot, then repeat the drill with your ideal number of strokes. Once you
flip, find the wall with your feet, holding your knees slightly bent, and push off in a

Starts
Starts are used primarily in competitive swimming, but recreational swimmers
and fitness swimmers can also benefit from knowing how to perform a good
start. In competitive swimming, starting involves performing a sequence of
movements to generate as much velocity as possible down the length of the pool.
After all, this is the last chance to push against something solid (until the turn) and to
benefit from gravity, so it pays to make the most of it.
For all of the strokes covered in this book, the start consists of four basic elements:
1) set, 2) push, 3) entry, and 4) streamline.
The set is the posture that you take on the side of the pool or on the starting
block. The push is the explosive movement that generates velocity down the pool.
The entry is the transition into the water, and the streamline is how you carry that
momentum into the water in order to use it as swimming speed.
In-Water StartS
Of course, many swimmers do not compete, but start skills are still important for
them. Beginners and others who cannot dive should look at the sections addressing
the streamline and the breakout in the stroke-specific discussions. In-water starts
involve simply pushing off from the wall, and they are perfectly legal in most com-
petitions. The rules do specify that you must have at least one hand on the wall and
must push off of the wall rather than contacting the bottom of the pool.
DIve StartS
Before you begin this step, make certain that the pool you are using is a safe place
to perform a dive start. Many pools either restrict diving or are not deep enough for
diving at all. Check with the lifeguard or your instructor to ensure that this particular
activity is appropriate at your pool. Depth requirements vary from governing body
to governing body, but all require at least 4.5 feet (~1.4 m); if you are a novice, then
even deeper is better. And again, before attempting any dive start, check with the
facility or safety staff—the risk of head or neck injury during a dive start is much
greater in shallow water.
Although many people know how to dive, the competitive dive start is a little
different from just diving in to get wet on a hot day. Even if you are an experienced
swimmer, it is good to have a refresher in the elements of diving.
161

--- Page 181 Text ---
Swimming: Steps to Success
A dive start is an attempt to maximize velocity and minimize drag at the start of a
contest. Since all of our strokes are headfirst, diving in headfirst (or rather hands first)
prevents any waste of energy from changing position. Ideally, a dive start involves
very little vertical content, thus directing the explosive movement down the length
of the pool. The transition into the water consists of angling down toward the water,
leading with the hands, and following with the rest of the body at an ideal angle for
achieving the best depth—not too much and not too little. The following progression
gets you used to the proper entry position.
KneelIng DIve
The first part of the progression is the kneeling dive (figure 8.1). During this part,
many swimmers place a towel on the deck to protect their knees. Repeat the process
several times before moving on; each time, try to enter through the “hole” that your
hands make in the water.

make in the water.

CorreCtIon

DIve-Start equIpMent
Before transitioning from the deck to the starting block, there are few things to
consider. First, not every facility has starting blocks, and those that do often place
restrictions on who is allowed to use them and under what circumstances. If you are
permitted to use the block—and if you have successful experience in diving from
the side of the pool—then you may want to begin working from the block. Starting
blocks traditionally stand 20 to 30 inches (0.5-0.75 m) above the water. This may not
seem like a great height, but it adds a lot of energy to the start and makes pool depth
all the more important. Though traditionally performed from a starting block, this
forward dive start can also be done from the side of the pool.
Starting blocks may be either removable or permanently installed. They come in a
variety of designs, depending on the manufacturer, but generally include a platform
angled slightly forward or down toward the water. Some also include a wedge at the
back, and this feature is currently considered state of the art for competitive racing
blocks. Let’s turn now to the various dive starts.
ForWarD or grab Start
The forward or grab start (figure 8.3) can be done from the deck or from a block and
is used for freestyle, breaststroke, and butterfly. To perform it, stand at the front edge
of the block with your toes curled over the edge, then bend at your waist and bend
your knees slightly. Next, grab the front edge of the block with both hands; it is very
important to keep your neck loose and look down or only slightly forward.
This is the set position, in which you should be reasonably comfortable with your
center of gravity directly above your feet and ankles. As your feet leave the block,
your hips, knees, and ankles should all be on the same line, parallel to the surface
of the water, in order to generate maximum forward velocity. Your upper body is
angled toward your entry position and your fingers are pointed directly to that spot.
As your feet enter the water, you should be 2 to 2.5 feet (0.6-0.75 m) under the sur-
face. It will take several attempts to find your ideal depth, which depends on which
stroke you are swimming and what is most comfortable to you. After your feet enter
the water, you are in the streamline phase. Perform this part of the start as described
in the stroke-specific step chapters.
164

--- Page 184 Text ---
Starts
Remember that at the instant you enter the water, you are traveling at the fast-
est speed you will achieve in your swim. Therefore, it is crucial to achieve a tight
streamline in order to avoid slowing down and to minimize drag. The streamline for
freestyle and butterfly involves powerful kicking at very high frequency, whereas the
breaststroke streamline involves the breaststroke pullout.
The breakout, once again, is the transition from streamlining to swimming. In all
of these strokes, the first few strokes after the streamline are crucial for maintaining
the momentum you generated in the start and the streamline. To do so, focus on
making your first few strokes powerful and flawless.

DrIllS For ForWarD or grab Start
Performing a good forward start depends on your ability to generate a great deal of
horizontal force and maintain the velocity generated by pushing off of something solid
from a significant height. The following drills help you master the forward start by
emphasizing each component of a good start.
Forward or Grab Start Drill 1 Standing Jump
This feetfirst drill isolates the push to help you generate explosive power from either
the pool deck or a starting block. From the take-your-mark position, instead of pulling
forward with your hands, let go and swing your arms forward. At the same time, push
forward as forcefully as possible to get as much forward velocity as you can, then pull
your feet up to enter the water feetfirst. Practice this drill several times to see how far
down the pool you can get.
In competition, start sequencing may vary in several ways. Most meets use whistle
commands. First, a series of short whistles from the starter or another official calls com-
petitors to the block. A long whistle then signals them to step up on the block (or into the
water in the case of backstroke) and get ready to assume the start position. The starter
then tells competitors to take their marks, at which time they need to get into the start
position and hold it. The start of the race itself is signaled by a horn or whistle.

take-your-mark position, performing the push, and then going as far as you can with
no movement—just a streamline. This drill not only maximizes your push force but
also ensures that you make a good entry and carry as much momentum as possible
into the water. Experiment with different depths and entry positions until you find
what works best for you.

Swimming: Steps to Success
Once you have mastered this drill, it is time to work on the breakout, which is
critical in maintaining the momentum you generate off of the block and during the
entry. In a race, a bad breakout can bring you almost to a complete stop, whereas a
good one can put you ahead. The following drill helps you work on making a smooth
transition from streamline to swimming.
Breakout Drill 1 Kick to the break
This drill helps you build on your mastery of the preceding drills by concentrating
on the transition from the streamline to swimming. As you have learned, a great deal
of momentum is lost with any nonstreamlined position or movement. To perform this
drill, do the set, push, and entry and then add vigorous and high-frequency kicking.
As you make your way down the pool underwater, push your chin forward and feel
yourself rise. When you break the surface, stop. If you are doing the breaststroke,
perform one pullout and rise to the surface. Take note of your position in the pool
each time you finish the drill.

traCK Start
The track start (figure 8.4) was developed in the 1950s by a few athletes who tinkered
around with it during practices and local competitions. The difference in the track
start is the start position. In this position, one foot is forward and the other is back,
just like track athletes use for their starts. During the 1960s and 1970s, it was used
by some U.S. collegiate swimmers, and in the 1980s a few U.S. swimmers became
the first to use it in international competition. They were disqualified, but a chal-
lenge to the ruling led to the conclusion that regulations did not require both feet to
be at the front of the starting blocks. By the 1990s, the technique had become more
widespread, and it is now the standard starting technique for most swimmers. It can
be done from the deck or from a block, and it is used in freestyle, breaststroke, and
butterfly.

streamline and perform the appro-

Which foot is the best foot to put forward? To answer this question, use the fol-
lowing simple methods. First, have a partner or your coach stand behind you. Stand
with your own feet together, close your eyes, and have the other person gently push
you forward. Whichever leg moves first to stop you from falling is your dominant
leg. This fact alone, however, does not make it the best foot to put forward.
169

--- Page 189 Text ---
Swimming: Steps to Success
Next, have the other person observe whether your hips are back or forward in
your set position. People whose hips sit a little back tend to be faster on the start when
they put the dominant leg forward; those whose hips sit forward tend to do better
with the nondominant leg forward. In either case, your feet should point straight
down the pool rather than at any kind of angle. Ultimately, of course, the only way
to tell for sure which approach is right for you is to try them out and see which one
gets you farther down the pool.
After your feet enter the water, you are in the streamline phase. Perform this part
of the start as described for each stroke in previous steps. Remember that the instant
you enter the water, you are traveling at the fastest speed you will achieve in your
swim. Therefore, it is crucial to achieve a tight streamline in order to avoid slowing
down and to minimize drag. The streamline for freestyle and butterfly involves pow-
erful kicking at very high frequency, whereas the breaststroke streamline involves
the breaststroke pullout.
The breakout, once again, is the transition phase from streamlining to swimming.
As mentioned earlier, push your chin forward slightly to adjust your depth and bring
you to the surface for swimming.
In all of these swimming strokes, your first few strokes after the streamline are
crucial for maintaining the momentum you generated in the start and the streamline.
To do so, focus on making your first few strokes powerful and flawless. In addition,
this particular type of start involves a few more variables that must be managed.
Whether you have your hips forward or back, your timing, and the amount of verti-
cal force you put into the start all influence the entry. If your feet do not enter through
the same hole in the water as the rest of the body, you may twist, which will influence
the way you streamline. You may have to make adjustments with your body and in
your streamline to ensure that you can manage the breakout effectively.
MISStep

CorreCtIon
Keep your neck loose; looking at the end of the pool constricts blood

CorreCtIon
Having the hips slightly forward or back is common and often merely
a matter of preference. However, a knee bend of more than 90
degrees does not allow for a good push. Move your hips forward.

DrIllS For the traCK Start
The next few drills focus on connecting all of the skills of the set, push, entry, and
breakout streamline into one integrated skill.
Track Start Drill 1 15-Meter
Though not really a drill, this exercise enables you to determine which start is best
for you. Try the grab start and record your time at 15 yards. Do the same for the
track start with each leg serving as the forward leg. Do this sequence several times
to determine which type of start is best for you.
In competition pools, the 15-yard mark is signified by an off-color (e.g., red or
yellow) disk as part of the lane line. If the pool does not have such a mark, you can
use any measured distance beyond 10 yards.
Track Start Drill 2 Standing Jump
This drill isolates the push portion of the start. From the take-your-mark position,
push forward as forcefully as possible to get as much forward velocity as you can.
Then pull your feet up to enter the water feetfirst. Practice this drill several times to
see how far down the pool you can get.

entry DrIllS
Once you have mastered the standing jump drill, it is time to work on the entry. Your
entry is crucial for maintaining the power that you generate off of the block. If you
go too shallow, you belly flop; if your angle is too severe, you go to the bottom of the
pool. On the other hand, the proper angle of entry—along with a good streamline—
gets you down the pool with the most efficiency and speed.
Entry Drill Streamline only
This drill isolates the entry portion of the start. It is performed by standing on the
block, getting into the take-your-mark position, performing the push, and going as
far as you can with no movement—just a streamline. The drill not only maximizes
your push force but also ensures that you make a good entry and carry as much
momentum as possible into the water. Experiment with different depths and entry
positions to find what works best for you.

Once you have mastered this drill, it is time to work on the breakout.
Breakout Drill Kick to the break
This drill helps you build on your mastery of the preceding drills by concentrating
on the transition from the streamline to swimming. As you have learned, a great deal
of momentum is lost with any nonstreamlined position or movement. To perform this
drill, do the set, push, and entry and then add vigorous and high-frequency kicking.
As you make your way down the pool underwater, push your chin forward and feel
yourself rise. When you break the surface, stop. If you are doing the breaststroke,
perform one pullout and rise to the surface. Take note of your position in the pool
each time you finish the drill.

baCKStroKe Curl Start
Backstroke differs considerably from the chest-down swimming strokes, and the
start (figure 8.5) is no exception. The backstroke start can be performed from the deck
or a block; either way, it is done in the water with the feet on the wall and the back
facing down the pool. For the entry, push off and do a back “dive,” which brings you
underwater and sets up the streamline.
An effective backstroke start begins, of course, with the set. Competitive blocks
are outfitted with grab bars for backstroke, but even then some swimmers opt to use
the deck. The set is performed by placing the feet flat on the wall with the elbows
bent.
Next comes the push, for which the key is timing. The result should be almost a
back dive. The most efficient swimmers follow an arc and their feet go from under
the water to out of the water and then back through the same hole that the upper
body goes through. Strong swimmers get the entire body out of the water at some
point and basically go through the same hole as the hands.
Depth on the entry differs from that of the chest-down strokes. In the backstroke,
the streamline and the dolphin kick are important elements. In fact, one of the fastest
recorded backstroke swims was done mostly on an underwater streamline with a
dolphin kick. With this in mind, if you are a good dolphin kicker, it works to your
advantage to go deeper and longer on the entry. In competition, your streamline is
allowed to extend for a maximum of 15 yards. Experiment to find out which head
and body positions produce the best streamline for you while keeping you underwa-
ter for the correct amount of streamline.
Since you are faceup, it is likely that water will go up your nose unless you breathe
out slowly. Alternatively, some swimmers opt for a nose clip.

DrIllS For baCKStroKe Curl Start
The following drills isolate each part of the start in order to help you perform the
skill effectively. One caveat: Many people find it uncomfortable to be upside down
and unable to see where they are going. Please make sure that the lane is clear before
you try these drills. Rest assured that the more you do them, the more comfortable
you get.
Backstroke Curl Drill 1 back Flip
One of the most difficult parts of the start is to avoid a flat or pancake start. Foot posi-
tioning will allow you to produce maximum force horizontally down the pool. Some
years ago, many swimmers—the rules allowed this—curled their toes over the gutter
to get a little extra vertical force to almost do a back dive into the water. While you are
not allowed to curl your toes over the gutter or deck, it is a good idea to place your
feet as close as you can to the top of the water.
This drill is performed by throwing your hands and arms back, almost as if trying
to touch the bottom of the pool behind you. This action requires you to arch your
back more than you do on a regular start. You must also attend to your head position-
ing; specifically, make sure to look back toward the bottom of the pool behind you.
If you end up vertical with your head down, then you have done the drill correctly.

Open-Water
and Survival
Swimming
Open-water swimming and what might be called survival swimming are the
roots of today’s competitive swimming. All swimming traces its history back
to ancient times, when pool swimming did not exist but of course both large
and small bodies of water did. Whether for sport or survival, then, this is where the
bloodline of all swimming begins.
Although open-water swimming and pool swimming share similar stroke skills,
they are completely different sports in many ways. For one thing, pool swimming
takes place in a very controlled environment with a set distance and controlled water
and air temperatures. In contrast, open-water and survival swimming take place in
settings affected by variable environmental factors. This step focuses on skills and
drills that are important for both competitive and recreational open-water swim-
ming, as well as those that can help you in an emergency.
Before you start, review the following safety principles, which applies to all types
of open-water swimming, whether for competition, recreation, or survival.
1. Never swim alone.
2. Be aware of environmental factors.
3. Plan your swim and make your plan known to others.
4. Take all appropriate safety equipment and make sure that it is in good work-
ing order.
183

Swimming: Steps to Success
Open-Water SWimming: the envirOnment
The first consideration for any open-water swim is the environment, which includes
air and water temperatures, weather, surface conditions, currents, geography (of
both the shore and the water beneath the surface), water quality, and any wildlife in
the area. (See figure 9.1 for a basic open-water course.) Air temperature plays a role
not only in the potential for hypothermia when you get out of the water but also in
how quickly a body of water cools. In addition, large differences between air tem-
perature and water temperature stress the body because the body requires energy to
regulate temperature.
Of course, water temperature itself is also of great concern. Water starts feeling
cold to most people around 81 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) and too warm
at about 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius). In international competitions,
water temperatures are required to be between about 61 and 88 degrees Fahrenheit
(16 and 31 degrees Celsius). Competitions with cooler temperatures often allow com-
petitors to use wetsuits for warmth rather than requiring traditional bathing suits.

E6544/Bay/fig 9.04/534233/kh/R2-alw
Another environmental concern for open-water swimming is the weather. A good
swim depends in part on good planning in relation to sunrise and sunset times,
as well as the weather forecast for the area. Swimming in the dark is never recom-
mended because of increased animal activity, less visibility, and colder tempera-
tures. Open-water swimmers should also avoid inclement weather, including rain
and especially thunderstorms. Fog is also a concern because it impedes navigation
and can create an emergency for an otherwise accomplished swimmer.
184

--- Page 204 Text ---
Open-Water and Survival Swimming
Open-water swimmers must also consider surface conditions when planning a
swim. This is especially true of larger bodies of water, in which waves and swells can
be problematic; however, it is also true for smaller bodies of water, in which even a
light chop of small waves can create an issue. Swells and chop are often caused by
wind, but they can also be produced by other factors, such as upwellings and tidal
changes.
Another—and often neglected—aspect of surface conditions involves traffic. It is
not recommended that you swim in an area of high boat traffic; interactions between
watercraft and swimmers usually end poorly for the swimmer. There may also be
surface debris, such as sticks, logs, and trash.
An open-water swim plan must also take account of currents and of the geog-
raphy—both of the bottom of the body of water and of the immediate shoreline. A
swimmer can be carried offshore by a rip current or downstream by river flow, and
either situation is dangerous. Therefore, it is crucial to know about any currents or
tides, including their strength and direction of flow. As for geography, consider all
possible factors. For example, is there a shallow entry or a drop-off? How deep is the
water? Is the shore sandy or rocky? Is there any vegetation?
In addition, when swimming in a body of water other than a pool (and sometimes
even in a pool!), you will encounter some form of biological life. It could be as simple
as bacteria, moss, or algae or as complex and intimidating as fish, jellyfish, reptiles,
or mammals. This caveat is not meant to discourage you from enjoying a swim in the
open water but to stress the importance of knowing what you are getting into. Check
with local officials to make sure that your intended swimming location is free from
harmful bacteria and other potentially dangerous life forms. Consider also the fact
that some aquatic and marine creatures follow regular patterns of daily or migratory
activity. Your best sources for information about such matters are local safety experts
and officials.
getting in and Starting
Before you begin this step, make sure that your chosen body of water is a safe place
for swimming. To do so, check with the lifeguard, local officials, or your instructor.
In addition, it is critically important to practice all of these drills in a pool or other
controlled environment before practicing in open water.
Entry
Here you bring to bear your geographical knowledge of the immediate shoreline or
dock area, as well as what lies beneath the water. When entering from a dock or boat
(figure 9.2), always adhere to the maxim “feet first the first time” in order to pre-
vent injury. Once you know the starting conditions—and how you are going to enter
the water—you can develop skills to help you enjoy competitive and recreational
open-water swimming.

drillS FOr FeetFirSt entry
Feetfirst entry is always the safest way to go, even when you can see the bottom or
know the water depth. The advantages of this entry include keeping your head near
the surface, or even above the water, if necessary due to cold or dirty conditions, for
example, or to keep an eye on a target in the water.
Entry and Start Drill 1 Compact-Jump entry and Swim
This drill helps you learn to get into the water from a dock or boat and immediately
begin swimming. The object of the drill is to keep your body close to the surface
and get to a horizontal position quickly and effectively. The drill requires you to find
progressively shallower parts of the pool, down to 3.5 feet (~1 m). Find a suitable
pool or body of water, check for any obstructions, and make sure that the conditions
are safe.
To do the drill, perform the entry as described earlier. Standing on the side of the
pool (or dock or boat), face the direction in which you are going to swim. Jump out
away from the side and draw up your knees so that your legs are bent and your feet
are under your hips. Extend your arms to your sides while in the air. As you hit the
water, sweep your arms forward to absorb the energy from the drop and to keep
your head above or near the surface of the water. Push your chest forward and kick
your feet to the surface as quickly as possible.

Like the preceding drill, this one helps you learn to get into the water from a dock or

And again, the drill requires you to find progressively shallower parts of the pool,

legs separated rather than together.
After checking the water to ensure safe conditions, stand on the side of the pool
(or dock or boat) and face the direction in which you are going to swim. Jump out
away from the side and draw your knees up so that your legs are bent with one
forward and one back, as if using a running stride. Extend your arms to your sides
while in the air. As you enter, sweep your arms forward to prevent any further forward
motion and to keep your head above water. Push your chest forward and kick your

Swimming: Steps to Success
Entry and Start Drill 3 treading-Water Start
Many people have a natural ability to tread water, and there are many ways to tread
effectively. The most common way is to use a horizontal sculling motion with the
hands while breaststroke-kicking with one leg at a time. This kick is commonly
referred to as the eggbeater. People who struggle with the breaststroke kick can
use a version of the flutter kick just as effectively. Either of these kicks can be used
for this drill.
The drill helps you prepare for times when you are stationary in the water and
cannot push off of the bottom to get started. To do the drill, perform a sculling action
with your hands in front to keep yourself stationary, then kick your legs and hips up
to the surface. You must arch your back to keep your head out of the water, but once
you are ready to go, just put your face in and start swimming.
Find a pool of sufficient depth that has plenty of room to execute the skill. Jump in
feetfirst and begin treading. From the treading position, slowly bring your feet to the
surface behind you with a kicking motion. To maintain balance, bring your sculling
hands forward and continuing the sculling out front. Once you are horizontal, hold
the position for at least a three-second count. Put your face in the water and begin
swimming.

Entry and Start Drill 4 Shore entry and dolphin-dive Start
Use this drill when you enter from a beach or other shore with a shallow and long
run out to deeper water. To do the drill, get clear knowledge of the bottom terrain,
then wade into ankle-deep water. Continue wading out until the water is at least waist
deep, then lean in, almost as if doing the butterfly stroke; be sure that your hands
are in front of you before you push off of the bottom. Come up, stand, and repeat as
necessary until you are in water of good swimming depth.
To do this drill in a pool, find a zero-entry pool or practice by diving over a lane
line or noodle in shallow water. If you are in a zero-entry pool, be sure that it has
sufficient depth for performing the drill safely. Keep your hands in front of your head
when dolphining into the water so that any change in depth is felt by your hands—
not your head. You can also dive under a lane line or noodle as if it were a wave
coming in to the shore; swimming over such waves is a waste of energy, so it is
better to simply duck under them.

navigatiOn and Sighting
Since there is no pool marking for you to follow on the bottom of an open body
of water, it is very helpful to develop skills that allow you to orient yourself in the
water. Moreover, much of the world’s open water provides you with only a few feet
of visibility (if that), which limits the value of lifting your head for vision, especially
since doing so can compromise your body position. In addition, without the benefit
of a pool marking, most swimmers tend to pull to one side or the other, thus com-
pounding the problem of navigation and encouraging you to look up more often
than you need to.
191

--- Page 211 Text ---
Swimming: Steps to Success
Combine these factors with challenging wind, waves, or currents and you can
end up all over the place. To make matters worse, the buoys that mark open-water
courses are often are hard to see. In many cases, therefore, it is better to find a more
prominent landmark on an opposite shore or some other stationary object to assure
you that you are swimming straight (figure 9.4). Here are a few skills and drills to
help you ensure that you swim in the right direction.
Figure 9.4 In open-water swimming, it’s best to use a prominent landmark when sighting
and navigating.
PreParation
1. Find a pool with an open lane that measures at least 25 yards.
2. At one end of the pool, stand directly on top of the lane stripe.
execution
1. Begin swimming freestyle and go for 10 strokes (each arm movement counts
as one stroke) with your eyes closed.
2. Stop after 10 strokes and put your feet down. If you are still directly on top
of the line, then you probably swim fairly straight and do not need to sight
as much as some swimmers do.
3. If, on the other hand, you were bouncing off of the lane line to one side or the
other, depending on overcorrections, you may want to review the freestyle
step to adjust this pulling to one side and sight more frequently.
miSStep
You are exhausted after 25 yards of swimming.
COrreCtiOn
You are probably sighting too often. Doing so causes you to start and
stop, which takes more energy. Sight a little less often.
192

--- Page 212 Text ---
Open-Water and Survival Swimming
miSStep
You end up way off course.
COrreCtiOn
Switch up your strokes and make sure that you are on line the whole
way. This allows your muscles to recover slightly for at least one
stroke. Perhaps sight a little more frequently and compensate if you
find yourself tending to pull to one side.
SWitCh drillS
The following drills help you not only with sighting during a competition but also
with engaging various muscles in a survival situation. The key in both cases is to
perform the skills with minimal energy expenditure.
Switch Drill 1 Freestyle-to-Breaststroke Switch
As mentioned in step 5, the breaststroke is the slowest of the competitive strokes
but offers some advantages. Aside from getting to breathe on every stroke, you also
get to look forward, which of course is very helpful when you need to quickly check
where you’re going while continuing to make progress. In short, the breaststroke
allows you to simultaneously get a peek—for example, at a buoy or landmark—and
a little air. To perform this drill, swim seven strokes of freestyle followed by three
strokes of breaststroke and then go back to freestyle.

Switch Drill 2 Freestyle-to-Backstroke Switch
There are also advantages to switching from freestyle to backstroke. First, you get
to breathe for a bit with your face out of the water so that you can also clear your
goggles or rest tired muscles used in the freestyle. Second, you can sneak a look
back and see where you have been to track progress and check heading.
To perform this drill, swim seven strokes of freestyle, then roll over and swim
three strokes of backstroke before returning to freestyle. During one of the freestyle
strokes it is okay to lift your head to see your competition or (in competition or sur-
vival situations) to see where you have been in order to judge the current.

Switch Drill 3 Surfing the goggles
This is a great drill for mastering freestyle in flatter water. To perform it, simply press
down slightly during the catch so that only your goggles break the surface, thus
allowing you to get a quick peek. The breath is still taken in a separate movement
from the peek to the side. The drill allows you to figure out the best height for your
goggles and find your rhythm.
First, take three strokes and then lift your head completely out of the water, making
sure that even your chin comes out. Repeat this sequence for 25 yards. Now do the
drill again but this time lift your head until just your mouth and nose are out of the
water. Then try it with just your goggles coming out. You should notice that surfing
just the goggles is easier and prevents you from stopping in the water. In each itera-
tion, after you take your sighting, press your chest down to regain horizontal equi-
librium and avoid having to kick your way back to horizontal. This undulating motion
also maintains your momentum.
How often do you need to look? You should have a pretty good idea of your
answer to this question if you did the eyes-closed exercise for navigation and sight-
ing described earlier. Try it some more to make sure that you know what works best
for you.

paCk SWimming
One of the most useful tools in an open-water swim is the ability to draft. Pack swim-
ming (figure 9.5) involves a lot of contact and often leaves very little space in the
water for just you. As in cycling, the pack moves as a group, and everyone tries to
find the right spot in which to gain an advantage. Also as in cycling, drafting gives
swimmers a little extra lift and makes the work a bit easier. Another benefit is that
you get to let someone else navigate—assuming he or she swims straight!
Unlike in cycling, the ideal swimming draft is done to the side and back rather
than directly behind. To get the idea, think of how geese fly. Aim to have your head
somewhere between the lead swimmer’s hip and her or his ankle; the exact position-
ing depends on the swimmer’s size, shape, velocity, and swim conditions.
Figure 9.5 When swimming in a pack, you will come into contact with other swimmers, so it’s
important to learn how to draft.
195

--- Page 215 Text ---
Swimming: Steps to Success
To perform this technique, you and a friend or instructor both leave the wall, the
friend or instructor leaving first. Find the spot where your freestyle stroke is long and
smooth as described in the positioning previously. In the boundary layer between
fluids and other materials, the velocities shed by and object provide vectors of force
in a variety of directions. If you can minimize the energy while maintaining a velocity
by making your strokes long and smooth, then you have found a good drafting posi-
tion. Try both the right and left sides until you determine which one you like best.
PreParation
1. Find two swimmers to help you with this skill.
2. Make sure that you have a free lane in which to practice the skill.
3. Ensure that no swimmers are coming the other way.
execution
1. Have the first swimmer start by swimming down the center of the lane.
2. After waiting a second or two, the second and third swimmers can start at
the same time on either side.
3. The draft position is slightly to the side, much like geese use when flying in
an echelon formation.
4. The best draft position is with the head somewhere between the lead swim-
mer’s hip and ankle.
5. Adjust your draft position forward and backward in this zone until you can
feel the benefit of the draft.

Drafting is more subtle in swimming than in cycling or auto racing. The positioning
differs as well. In cycling and auto racing, the ideal draft position is often behind the
lead cyclist or driver, but this is not true of swimming. In swimming, the swimmers
can be off to the side. To practice your position and drafting skills, use the following
drills.
Pack-Swimming Drill 1 three-person drafting
In a 25-yard pool, work with two other swimmers. Start one right after another and
have the second and third swimmers get into drafting position. Switch lead swim-
mers every 25 yards. You can use either a V formation with a drafter on either side of
the lead swimmer or a diagonal formation in which swimmer 2 drafts off of the lead
swimmer and swimmer 3 drafts off of swimmer 2.

Pack-Swimming Drill 2 rollover
This drill is helpful if you like drafting on one side better than on the other because it
helps you learn to switch from one side of the lead swimmer to the other side. To per-
form the drill, start by rolling inward and taking one backstroke stroke in a twisting
motion. As your backstroke arm reaches for the catch, your body width matches that
of the lead swimmer, and after completing the roll, your next stroke is on the opposite
side. In other words, depending on which side you start on, you either do a back-
stroke with your left hand and roll to the front with a right-hand stroke, or vice versa.
This maneuver puts you on the other side of the lead swimmer’s feet without
losing momentum. It is a little tricky, and you should practice it in a pool before trying
it in an open-water environment.

Changing direCtiOn
Most open-water swims require you to turn or at least change direction. Doing so
without losing momentum is an art form. When swimming freestyle, the human
body is just not meant to bend laterally very much; humans are much better at bend-
ing forward at the waist. Having said that, one of the more effective turns involves
taking one backstroke stroke and bending at the waist so that your upper body points
in the direction in which you want to go after the turn. Your legs will follow. This
technique allows you to change direction without breaking rhythm, and swimmers
who can touch their toes can use it to make as much as a 180-degree direction change.
Another effective turn is the one-arm turn, which is a little more conservative and
flat. To perform it, extend your inside arm in front of you and position the palm of
that hand vertically so that it acts like a rudder. Use your other arm to stroke until
you finish the turn. Your inside arm is closer to the buoy, and your stroking arm is
farther from it.

This is an excellent drill for working on your cornering. In either a shallow or deep

tively, if you can remove the lane lines, simply use a simple balloon anchored to the
bottom by a weight. Make sure to leave sufficient room for the turn. Roll onto your

FiniSh and exit
Whether you are finishing and exiting a race or swimming in a survival situation, it
is critical to conserve energy. Swimmers who are accustomed to using an energy-con-
serving two-beat kick often find that the body directs all of its energy resources to
the muscles doing the most work in the upper body. For this reason, competitive
open-water swimmers and triathletes alike often experience cramping in the lower
body and a lack of balance upon getting back on dry land. With this risk in mind,
it is important to get circulation and resources flowing to the lower body as well—
regardless of how you get out of the water, you will need to use your legs to walk or
run.
Another hazard arises for many competitive swimmers and triathletes after they
round the final buoy. At this point, they make a mad dash for the shore without
thinking much about sighting, which may cause them to waste energy by swimming
too far due to poor navigation. It is also important at this stage to maintain rhythm
to prevent swimming too far or going into oxygen debt before the end of the race,
forcing you to back off the pace.
exiting the Water
Exits will vary depending on the course some are ramp exits while others are just
shore approaches. The exit is similar to the entry in a few ways. The first is that you
have to make sure you have a target to reach. Knowing where the finish is and about
what the distance from the last turn is will be helpful here.
Next is the fact that kicking is important. In the beginning of an open water race,
many swimmers use a high kick tempo to create separation from the pack. After-
wards, they may settle into a slower two- or four-beat kick to save energy. The prob-
lem with this is that much of the body’s resources get concentrated in the upper body
as the legs do not require as much. It is important to remember to pick up the kick to
increase the blood flow to the lower extremities.

As with the dolphin dive entry, you can use this technique when you exit the beach
or other shore with a shallow and long run up from deeper water.
Once you start swimming toward water that is shallow enough to touch bottom,
continue swimming into shore until the water is at most thigh deep. Lean in, almost
as if doing the butterfly stroke. Make sure that your hands are in front of you before
you push off of the bottom. Come up, stand, and repeat as necessary until you are
in shallow enough water that you can stand up and walk easily.

both into and out of the water.
Survival SWimming
Sidestroke, though not a competitive stroke, is a great stroke to master for open-water
and survival swimming. It allows you to have your face out of the water to breathe and
uses a powerful scissorlike kick. Like breaststroke, it derives propulsion almost equally
from armstroking and kicking. As the name implies, sidestroke is done on the side; one
shoulder and arm are toward the bottom of the pool, and the other shoulder is out of
the water with the majority of the arm submerged. As with the other strokes discussed
in this book, the best way to master the sidestroke is to master its individual elements
separately and then put them all together.
Sidestroke Kicking
The sidestroke employs a scissor kick (figure 9.7), which differs from the flutter kick in
that the legs are wide apart and the swimmer is on his or her side. To perform the scis-
sor kick, bring the leg that is closer to the surface forward by drawing the knee toward
your chest. The leg that is closer to the bottom of the pool extends back so that you
are almost in a stridelike position on your side. Next, bring your legs together while
extending the leg that was drawn to the chest. As you wedge yourself forward, you
should feel the pressure on the back of your top leg and on the front of your bottom leg.

Open-Water and Survival Swimming
Sidestroke Arm Sweep
Armstroking in the sidestroke (figure 9.8) involves a chain of movements. The
extended arm sweeps down, with the elbow bent, to about the mid body; whereas
the arm closest to the surface sneaks up along the body. The hands meet, and the arm
closest to the surface then pushes back down toward the thigh while the other arm
sneaks forward. Many swimmers benefit from using the mental image of reaching to
pick an apple, then transferring it to the other hand to put it in a bag at the hip.

Complete Sidestroke
The process of putting it all together for the sidestroke is very similar to the process
for the breaststroke in that your arm and leg movements must be somewhat inde-
pendent. The most effective use of the powerful kick is to perform it while you are
extended, with your lead arm out, so be patient. While your legs recover to kick
again, your momentum should be maintained by the propulsive force of the pull and
armstroke. Do the following to practice the complete sidestroke.

elementary BaCkStrOke
Though not a competitive stroke, the elementary backstroke (figure 9.9) is an effec-
tive open-water tool and a great stroke for survival swimming because it enables you
to propel yourself while expending minimal energy. In addition, your face is always
out of the water, which enables you to breathe easily. The stroke is performed by
incorporating an arm push and a breaststroke kick while lying on your back. Unlike
the breaststroke, this stroke involves nearly simultaneous arm and leg movements.
Make sure that your arms stay in the water the whole time. When practicing this
stroke in a pool, make sure that the backstroke flags are in place or have a friend
observe to prevent you from running into the wall.

SWim, FlOat, and SWim again
This strategy gives you a simple way to prevent exhaustion if you are intentionally
swimming a long distance or become tired in an emergency situation. It consists
simply of swimming one of the strokes you have learned in the previous steps, then
rolling onto your back and floating in the neutral position to rest. You then roll back
over and continue swimming. When fatigue returns, repeat the process.
To practice this sequence, swim until you feel tired, then roll over to float (figure
9.10). Once you have recovered, continue swimming. Performing this skill multiple
times over several hundred yards will increase your confidence in open water.

SuCCeSS Summary
Swimming in open water resembles pool swimming in important ways but also
involves additional skills that make it very different in some respects. Environmental
concerns and the lack of control over many elements of the swimming venue make
open-water swimming particularly challenging; they also elevate the need for cau-
tion and close attention to safety.

Continuing
With Swimming
You have now taken the first steps in your swimming journey. If you have found
greater confidence in the water as you have progressed through the steps in this
book, it is time to explore options for continuing your swimming, whether for
recreation or for competition.
The first part of the process involves finding a place to swim regularly. Many
parks and recreation departments maintain swimming pools that are open to the
public on at least a seasonal basis. Other places to search include the YMCA, YWCA,
Jewish Community Centers, fitness clubs, swim clubs, schools, and health and well-
ness centers. Key considerations include schedule, quality of facilities, staff, and, of
course, cost.
The next part of the process involves practicing the skills that you have already
mastered and building on them. The sport of swimming depends on skill-based
movement, and it is often helpful to go all the way back to the beginning to review
what you have done and see where you can make improvements. Now that you have
been through the process once—and gained a new level of confidence in the water—
it would be a good idea to go back through the steps and make sure that you get them
right at the highest level of which you are capable.
Goal SettinG
Goal setting is an important part of any healthy lifestyle, whether it is done for fit-
ness, recreation, or competition. Regardless of what area of life you are addressing,
goal setting gives you direction and focus. It helps shape your decision making, not
just about how you spend your exercise time but also about other aspects of your life,
such as what you eat and drink and how much rest you get.
If you are interested in swimming purely as a way to stay fit or get fit, then you
may think that goal setting is unimportant in this area of your life. That is, however,
far from true. Fitness goals do tend to take on different characteristics than compet-
itive goals, but they are goals nonetheless. Here are just a few examples of fitness
goals: lowering your heart rate, losing weight, feeling better, making your clothes fit
better, and cross-training.
215

--- Page 235 Text ---
Swimming: Steps to Success
Swimming is also used by athletes from other sports who want to supplement
their usual routine or rehab an injury. In fact, there is a whole branch of sports med-
icine and rehab that use aquatics as a way of getting people back into athletics—or
just back into their normal pattern of life. In addition, more and more physicians are
prescribing exercise as a pathway to better health on all levels.
For recreational swimmers, goals are a little easier to quantify, since they often
involve either distance or time or both. Many recreational swimmers are also seeking
to do a first triathlon or perhaps just become able to swim a certain distance or swim
for a certain amount of time. These swimmers need to set a goal to get them out of
bed for a morning workout or help them be sure to swing by the pool on the way
home from work. In other examples, a person might set a goal of obtaining scuba
certification or getting fit enough to keep up with active peers. Swimmers in this cat-
egory also set goals for becoming more comfortable in the water and more efficient
in their movements.
If you have found that you excel in a given stroke, then you may wish to think
about competing. Competitive goals tend to be tightly focused, and they vary widely
from swimmer to swimmer. For example, some swimmers aim to do better in the
swim portion of a local triathlon, whereas others want to compete in open-water or
pool-based events. The best and most focused goals are based on measurable criteria,
such as performing a specific stroke for a specific time and distance. This type of goal
is much different from, say, setting a general goal of winning.
How to Do It Well
Regardless of whether you are a fitness, recreational, or competitive swimmer, your
goals should be challenging and motivating. Many people have found that they set
more effective goals if they use a system based on the acronym SMART.
The S in SMART stands for specific, which means that the goal should include
meaningful detail about activity, time, location, and requirements. A vague goal
might read like this: “I am going to start swimming more.” In contrast, a more spe-
cific goal might read like this: “I am going to swim three or more times per week.”
This kind of specificity is useful in fitness, recreational, and competitive swimming.
The M in SMART stands for measurable. Setting measurable goals helps you hold
yourself accountable and motivates you when you reach milestones by giving you a
sense of accomplishment. The key here is to determine what you are trying to meas-
ure. For example, a fitness swimmer might track number of swims, a recreational
swimmer might track distance covered, and a competitive swimmer might track
times.
The A stands for achievable. It may be inspirational to think that you can do any-
thing you set your mind to, but it is often more effective to set short-term goals that
are attainable on your way to achieving a long-term ambition. Achievable goals serve
as milestones on your path to a bigger goal. The best part is that the more often you
achieve meaningful goals, the better you get at developing the skills, personal attrib-
utes, mind-set, and habits that lead you to bigger goals.
The R stands for realistic. When setting goals, you should always be honest with
yourself. For example, if you have just started swimming and have mastered all of
the strokes presented in this book, then you might set a realistic goal of swimming
a mile (1.6 km) without stopping within the next year. An example of an unrealistic
goal would be trying to make the U.S. national swim team in the next six months.
Granted, this is a dramatic example, but it can in fact be a tricky thing to set a realistic
216

Continuing With Swimming
goal. Make it too easy and there is no challenge; a result, meeting your goals may
ring hollow. Make it too challenging and you may get frustrated with the process and
move on to something else.
Finally, the T stands for time—that is, identifying a specific time period in which
you want to accomplish your goal. This is the part of your goal that gets you out of
bed on a cold morning or motivates you to squeeze in a swim over lunch. You are typ-
ically happy later on for doing so, but many of us can rationalize many reasons to skip
what we know is good for us in exchange for an extra 10 minutes of sleep or a slice
of pizza or scoop of ice cream. Mind you, these things are not necessarily bad in their
proper place, but a time-limited goal keeps your focus on what you want to achieve
and when you want to get it done. Simply saying “I want to lose weight” has no real
meaning in terms of time, but saying “I want to lose five pounds by January 1” puts
the goal on the clock and is much more likely to change your behavior.
Following Up on Goals
Once you achieve a goal, what comes next? In competitive swimming, the answer
is easy because the next goal can always be set by the clock. In contrast, fitness and
recreational swimmers might focus on doing more frequent swims or even having a
go at competitive swimming. Regardless of how you frame the issue, have your next
goal ready when you achieve your current one. In addition, make time to celebrate
your achievements. Reward and recognition are very motivating, especially when the
rewards are intrinsic.
FindinG a ProGram
Various programs are available, and the right choice depends on your goals. For exam-
ple, if you are a fitness or recreational swimmer, you may not need a lot of structure; in
fact, you may find great satisfaction in accomplishing everything on your own. Due to
the technical nature of the sport, however, most people need a support group or pro-
gram to help them along. Many large metropolitan areas are home to a diverse group
of swimming programs; smaller areas may have fewer options. In either case, certain
questions can help you decide whether to join a program or continue on your own.
Two big considerations are program schedule and program structure. If the pro-
gram’s schedule does not fit yours, this need not necessarily be end of the conversa-
tion with that facility. Ask if the staff would consider offering a program at a time that
works better for you. Many swimmers just accept a schedule as it is posted and move
on if it doesn’t work for them, but sometimes a facility manager is simply unaware
of the demand for a different time slot. If a number of swimmers show up at the pool
at the same time you prefer, go ahead and ask the management about starting a new
offering or expanding an existing one.
The structure of the program is also a consideration. Some programs just have
a workout leader who swims the workout and provides minimal feedback. Others
are more instructive, providing a teacher in the water or on the deck who can give
individual feedback and really help participants improve. Still other programs have
a full-time professional coach on the deck who helps swimmers both with workout
considerations and with stroke improvement. The most instructive setup, of course, is
the lesson environment. A careful review of your experience with this book can help
you identify what type of program is best suited to your needs and goals.

ChooSinG a CoaCh or inStruCtor
This process involves a number of factors, all of which focus on you; indeed, swim-
ming programs exist not because of coaches or instructors but because of swimmers.
As in any profession, there are good coaches and instructors, and there are poor ones.
In addition, what works for one swimmer may not work for another. As much as
possible, your choice should be dictated by your goals and your level of proficiency.
For any swimmer, the introduction to a program, coach, or instructor should
always start with a conversation. If yours is a new face on the pool deck, then you can
expect someone from the program to greet you. Hopefully, that person does a short
interview and asks about your swimming background. The best bet is to be honest so
that the coach or instructor gets a good idea of what you want and need.
It is also a good idea to ask him or her plenty of questions. Here are a few exam-
ples: What is your coaching philosophy? How do you integrate new people into the
group? And what is the fee for the program? As for program content, some coaches
and instructors take a workout-oriented approach, whereas others focus more on
instruction. Neither approach is necessarily better than the other; again, it depends
on your goals.
The nature of a good coach or instructor may vary from one person’s opinion to
another, but certain characteristics are shared by all great coaches in any sport. First,
they care—not only about the sport and its highest-level athletes but also about help-
ing every athlete they encounter, regardless of level or goals, to love the sport and
continually seek improvement. They put effort into each athlete and each session
while also working to make themselves better. This is what coaching grit is all about.
If one method doesn’t work, they try another—and another and another—until they
are successful with each athlete. Nor are they afraid to ask for help from a colleague;
in fact, the best coaches do this all the time. They are committed to helping athletes
achieve their goals, which is why they are themselves successful. Where do you find
these programs and people? Read on.
SWimminG reSourCeS
The next part of your journey into the wider world of swimming is to look for resources
to help you become a better swimmer. Of course, several resources are available from
Human Kinetics that are part of the aquatics department. There are also multimedia
resources, such as videos and other instructional media. A word of caution: Most
anyone can “publish” most anything on the web, which means that you need to exer-
cise a critical eye in selecting swimming materials. The most reputable sources for
additional instruction are the national governing bodies that work with aquatics,
from the very young to the most senior members of the aquatics community. Through
these organizations, you can find numerous resources, including in-person coaching.
USA Swimming (www.usaswimming.org) is the governing body that regulates
U.S. swimming for age groups from eight and under all the way through elite inter-
national competition, including the Olympics. USA Swimming is governed primarily
by volunteers, and contact can be made through Local Swimming Committees (LSCs)
since the organization is structured geographically. Simply access the USA Swimming
website, which will put you in touch with local resources to help you along on your
swimming journey if you are looking for a very high level of competition or access to
coaches at this level.
218

Continuing With Swimming
U.S. Masters Swimming (www.usms.org) is dedicated to providing adults 18
years old and over with access to health, wellness, fitness, and competition through
aquatics. Adults seeking resources (e.g., workout plans and additional instruction)
can look here to find programs for aquatics at every level in their local area. Like
USA Swimming, this organization depends on volunteers and operates in the same
manner—in this case, through Local Masters Swimming Committees (LMSCs).
Another national governing body that deals with adult aquatics and fitness
on a variety of levels in USA Triathlon (www.usatriathlon.org). This organization
addresses all ages and, since one of the disciplines of triathlon is swimming, it can
provide you with a number of opportunities to continue your swimming if you
choose multisport racing for fitness or competition.
In addition to national governing bodies, there are a number of professional swim
teaching and coaching organizations that you can contact for additional resources.
All you need to do is search for them using keywords such as “swim instruction” or
“swim lessons.” Many can be found at the same facilities that you are looking at to
secure lane space, so you have a convenient way to continue your journey.
Swimming is a great sport for health, wellness, and competition; it is also a life
skill in that it can mean surviving an emergency situation. May this book not only
help you be a better swimmer but also set you on the path to swimming as a lifelong
sport!
