WELCOME
Introduction
Congratulations on your decision to become an Ellis & Associates (E&A) lifeguard. Following successful
completion of your course, you will join a select group of aquatic professionals who apply proven state-of-the-
art aquatic injury prevention practices to reduce the number of emergency incidents, and when necessary, to
respond rapidly and effectively to any emergency. As a result of E&A’s emphasis on prevention, professionalism,
accountability, and proactive risk management, our safety record is unsurpassed in the aquatic industry.
E&A - A History of Leadership and Innovation
In 1983 our program was created to address waterpark safety issues. Due to the great demand for this quality
program, it quickly expanded to pools, open-water environments, and resorts. Over a period spanning four
decades, E&A has been credited for revolutionizing the safety standards of the aquatic recreational and
amusement industry. Here are but a few E&A industry “firsts”:
• Elevating professional lifeguard standards through operational safety audits for lifeguard accountability
• Developing, implementing, and advocating for industry benchmarks and proactive risk management
standards such as our 10/20 Protection™ and 10/3 Protection™ standards, Vigilance Awareness Training®
(VAT®), and Zone Validation® system
• Developing equipment-based rescues that are safer and more effective than body contact rescues
• Incorporating bloodborne pathogens training into lifeguard training classes
• Introducing supplemental oxygen support (SOS), resuscitation masks, bag valve masks, manual suction devices,
and automated external defibrillators (AEDs) to enhance resuscitation efforts provided by aquatic staff to enhance
lifeguard resuscitation efforts
• Establishing a national database for aquatic injuries and injury prevention
• Offering the first blended e-learning lifeguarding program in the world
Our Educational Philosophy
The emphasis of our lifeguarding curriculum is on preventing aquatic emergencies by consistently monitoring
guests, enforcing rules, and identifying and correcting potential dangers. Should an emergency occur our
lifeguards are prepared to work individually and as members of a team to respond rapidly and professionally.
We do not focus on executing textbook-perfect rescues, as such situations seldom occur in real-life. It is more
important for lifeguards to think critically, rationally, and overcome adverse rescue situations.
To achieve these learning outcomes E&A lifeguard candidates are immersed in the job of the lifeguard while
completing the course. They participate in hands-on lifeguarding activities including proactively scanning zones
as apprentice lifeguards. Through the design and delivery of our curriculum lifeguards exit our program with the
necessary knowledge, skills, and attitude to conduct themselves professionally and confidently.

Introduction to Lifeguarding 2
Why Lifeguards?
Around the world, people of all ages happily swim in aquatic facilities, resort and hotel pools, and on beaches
without worry knowing that lifeguards are on duty providing pro-active surveillance. Facility guests put
their trust and safety in the hands of these well-trained individuals capable of performing water rescues and
emergency care including CPR. If a guest becomes fatigued, injured or at risk for other reasons, the lifeguard
enters the water and helps return the guest to safety. This is the responsibility you agree to take on as an Ellis
and Associates (E&A) trained lifeguard.
History Of Lifeguarding
Some of the earliest, documented cases of lifeguarding can be traced to the 1700s. These early lifeguarding
efforts were primarily designed to aid those serving in battle or traveling the waterways. Comprised of military
and coast guard personnel, these early lifeguards were dedicated to eliminating or minimizing loss of life and
providing rescue and recovery services.
The first of these organizations was China’s Chinkiang Association for the Saving of Life, which offered money
and prizes for significant rescues.
Towards the mid-1800s, swimming became a popular pastime and recreational activity. In the United States,
oceanfront hotels and resorts began to dot the landscape in places like Atlantic City, New Jersey, The emerging
railroads would transport thousands of people to Atlantic City during the summer months to enjoy the beaches.
This brought an increased risk for drowning and other incidents. Demand for swimmer protection grew.
In 1855, a town in New Jersey took the first steps towards providing swimmer protection with the first
volunteer lifeguard team for beach patrol called the “Constables of the surf.” The Constables were police
officers tasked with responding to any beach emergency involving swimmers in the water. In the early 1900s
California instituted its first beach lifeguards (Fig 1.1).
Through the years, efforts to protect facility guests continued as more and more organizations looked to
ensure safety, developing training protocols, innovative rescue operations, and improved teaching materials
to better prepare lifeguards for the important task of preventing drownings. Today’s professional lifeguard is
better trained, and more equipped than ever before to protect lives in and around the water (Fig 1.2).

Drowning: A Global Crisis
Drowning is the third leading cause of unintentional injury and death worldwide. It is the fifth cause of
death globally for children ages one-14 years old, impacting an estimated 360,000 children annually. Death
by drowning occurs in all regions of the world and in all types of economies. Deaths are especially prevalent
in lower and middle-income countries, regions of Africa, and in the Western Pacific and Southeast Asia,
accounting for half of the world’s drownings.
Higher risks for drowning include a number of additional factors:
• Alcohol use near the water
• Medical conditions such as seizure disorders
• Tourists unfamiliar with local features and risks
• Unsupervised and unattended children
The main risk factors for drowning involve:
• Lack of swimming ability
• Lack of barriers to prevent unsupervised access
• Children unsupervised
• Failure to wear life jackets
• Alcohol use
• Seizure disorders
U.S. Statistics on Drowning
Drowning is a significant problem in the United States, ranking fifth among the causes of unintentional injury
deaths. Everyday about ten people die from unintentional drowning. About one in five people who die from
drowning are children 14 years of age or younger. For every child who dies from drowning, another five
receive emergency department care for serious, nonfatal submersion injuries.

--- Page 16 Text ---
Introduction to Lifeguarding 4
Did You Know?
• Worldwide drowning is the third leading cause of unintentional injury death.
• In the U.S. more than 3600 people die from unintentional drowning annually; about two in 10 are
children 14 years old and younger.
Ellis & Associates (E&A) Lifeguards
Having a lifeguard is the only consistently proven
means of preventing drownings and other tragic
incidents, in and around water. The best lifeguards
are those who are highly trained, professional, and
most of all, accountable (Figure 1.3).
In 1983, Ellis & Associates was founded to create the
best lifeguards in the aquatic industry to meet the needs
of an emerging industry - water parks. E&A lifeguards
have a mission to prevent submersion incidents and
potential loss of life and are held accountable to a high
standard of care. As an E&A trained lifeguard, your goal
Figure 1.3 Professional lifeguards are highly trained
is zero drownings annually.
and accountable for their actions.
E&A’s International Lifeguard Training Program (ILTP®) stresses values that include safety, consistency, and integrity.
• Safety - Guests and employees of aquatics facilities trust you with their personal safety. You are
responsible for providing a safe environment for them and yourself. To accomplish this, you must pro-
actively identify and manage risk.
• Consistency - To uphold the E&A Standard, you will consistently represent the E&A Philosophy and
effectively meet the skill and knowledge competencies of this program.
• Integrity - Being an E&A lifeguard requires a passion for aquatic safety. You will sincerely care about the
lives and well-being of those you protect. You will feel a sense of commitment and hold yourself personally
accountable to the swimmers you protect, the E&A training program, and your fellow lifeguards.
As a result of our collective emphasis on lifeguard professionalism, prevention, accountability, and
proactive risk management, E&A’s safety record is unmatched in the aquatic industry.
The vigilance of E&A lifeguards along with their commitment to E&A training standards has been proven
effective in preventing drownings and providing quality care in the event of an emergency.

--- Page 19 Text ---
Introduction to Lifeguarding 7
On-Going Training
Your training often continues after your lifeguard course is completed. Your aquatic facility is likely to
provide you with the additional training you need to effectively perform at your specific job location. Those
requirements will be made clear by your employer. Additional training may be provided:
• Pre-service training – what takes place before you start working
• In-service training/meetings – Training completed after the lifeguard course but before you officially
begin working as a lifeguard
• Operational drills/audits – periodic testing to ensure you remain “test ready”
Pre-Service Training
Pre-service training may review how the concepts learned in a lifeguarding class apply at a specific site.
Additional information may be provided such as:
• How the Emergency Action Plan (EAP) is applied at specific locations
• Reviewing skills for operating in specific facility locations
• Reviewing the standard operating procedures for the facility/attraction
In-Service Training
In-service training is intended to serve as an
ongoing practice session for you to maintain and
enhance your skills learned during the original
lifeguard class. In-service training can also be an
opportunity for feedback on skill performance.
In-service is also an excellent time to have
lifeguard team meetings to review skill concepts.
Your supervisor and company are responsible for
scheduling and delivering your in-service training
sessions. It is important that you attend these
sessions as they contribute to your professionalism
and help keep your skills sharp (Figure 1.4).
Figure 1.4 In-service training helps to keep your skills
sharp.
Operational Drills/Audits
Operational drills and audits are conducted by some facilities throughout the operating day. These operational
drills and audits may include lifeguard evaluations that can include the use of people, manikins or silhouette dolls
to monitor your vigilance. Some drills may also involve scenarios where rescue skills are performed. As an E&A
lifeguard, you should embrace all opportunities to both improve and demonstrate your lifeguarding abilities.

Introduction to Lifeguarding 8
Primary Responsibilities Of Lifeguards
E&A lifeguards are professional first responders. Your primary job function is to prevent aquatic emergencies.
But not all incidents are foreseeable and preventable. In such cases you must also know how to recognize,
respond, and render appropriate care.
Preventive Lifeguarding
Preventive lifeguarding is a critical and demanding
part of your lifeguarding job. A lifeguard must
remain alert and work to prevent emergencies.
As a lifeguard, people rely on you to prevent
catastrophic incidents. This job requires your
undivided attention. If you allow yourself to
become distracted while lifeguarding, it could
result in a loss of life. It is a difficult job, but it is
very rewarding (Figure 1.5).
Figure 1.5 Lifeguarding is a demanding job that
Preventive lifeguarding involves items such as: requires you to remain alert at all times.
• Being alert
• Enforcing facility rules
• Answering swimmer’s questions while continuing to effectively scan your zone
• Warning guests of potential hazards
• Following your training
• Notifying your supervisor when you cannot see all your assigned area
• Communicating with other lifeguards about hazards in the water
Expect the Unexpected
Guests can be unpredictable. They may enter water depths or elements that may cause them to get into
trouble. The water conditions may become too challenging for a swimmer to manage on their own and require
a rescue. They may suffer a medical emergency in or out of the water.
It is your job as a lifeguard to recognize when a swimmer is in trouble and to quickly react to render care.
Recognizing an emergency means you must maintain a high level of vigilance, effectively scanning your
assigned zone. Managing an aquatic emergency means reacting as trained, in a safe and effective manner
(Figure 1.6).

Introduction to Lifeguarding 9
Secondary
Responsibilities
Of Lifeguards
As a lifeguard you will have numerous secondary
responsibilities such as:
• Inspecting the facility
• Documentation
• Cleaning the facility
• Testing water chemistry Figure 1.6 When a guest is in trouble you must recognize
• Crowd control the emergency and respond promptly.
• Providing guest services
Inspecting the Facility
You may be required to inspect your facility before opening it for daily guests. This inspection will attest
to the facility being in appropriate operating condition. This includes having a means of calling 9-1-1, and
appropriately operating safety and response equipment.
Documentation
Your facility may require you to maintain accurate documentation. Each facility is likely to have records and
reports specific to its unique operation such as:
• Daily sign-in sheets • Incident and witness reports
• Facility inspection checklists • Daily work schedules
• Attendance records • Water chemistry logs
• Lifeguard rotation logs • Weather condition reports
• Facility maintenance records • In-service training records
• Equipment inspection forms • Attraction downtime records
• Rescue reports
Rescue reports and Incident/Witness statement reports are among the most important paperwork you will
complete. The documentation must be completed as soon as the incident or rescue has been resolved. Make
sure to fill in each section completely. These forms may become legal records in the future, and adequate
documentation will minimize problems at that time.

--- Page 22 Text ---
Introduction to Lifeguarding 10
Cleaning the Facility
You may be required to clean your facility area and visitor seating areas daily, and collect debris or rubbish in the
area, potentially preventing it from blowing in the pool and contaminating the water. You may also be expected to
vacuum the pools, skim the top of the pool to remove debris, and clean pool walls, patio areas, and other areas
of the facility. These tasks are part of preventive lifeguarding which removes hazards and potential risks that could
cause problems later. A lifeguard who removes puddles from the pool patio area can help eliminate a potential
algae hazard that causes a slippery surface. As a professional lifeguard, it is your task to keep your facility and
area clean eliminating potential risks and hazards
(Figure 1.7).
Testing Water Chemistry
Some facilities may require that you test and
monitor the water chemistry of the swimming pool
before opening the pool and throughout the day to
ensure that it matches the requirements based on
the guidelines listed in your local codes and/or the
MAHC recommendations. If your facility requires
you to test the water chemicals as a part of your job
responsibility, your facility should provide you with
additional training for this task. If you are responsible
Figure 1.7 Secondary tasks include keeping your
for adding chemicals and managing the pumps, you
facility clean.
may be required to take a separate course to become
trained as a Certified Pool Operator (CPO), Aquatic
Facility Operator (AFO) or complete a unique
facility requirement training course (Figure 1.8).
Figure 1.8 You may have to test water chemistry as
part of your job responsibilities.

--- Page 23 Text ---
Introduction to Lifeguarding 11
Crowd Control
During an emergency, crowds may gather around the scene and you will be tasked with controlling the
situation. Know your facility’s emergency action plan (EAP) to be prepared for any incident requiring crowd
control. Crowd control might be necessary during guests altercations, special events, severe weather
conditions, rescues with resuscitation efforts, chemical leaks, and terrorism threats. Become familiar with all
the access and exit points in case an area needs to be evacuated in the facility or a path needs to open so that
emergency medical services (EMS) personnel can access a scene to render care and/or support.
When you need to control a crowd:
• Remain calm
• Speak loudly and with authority
• Give clear, precise and simple instructions
Providing Guest Services
Lifeguards are the employees of the facility most noticeable to guests. You are likely to encounter guests asking
questions about the attractions, directions to various points in the facility, advise on caring for sunburn, and
many others. You will be interacting with guests to make certain they understand and comply with the rules of
the facility. Be professional in all your interactions with guests, determine their needs, and resolve any guest
issues in a cordial manner. If you are uncertain about how to help a guest, contact a supervisor.
Being Held Accountable
As a lifeguard you are expected to anticipate, recognize, and manage aquatic emergencies. Your training does
not end after the course. Your skills need to be maintained at a test-ready level throughout your credential
validity period. As an E&A lifeguard you are accountable to:
• Facility guests - Provide a safe environment for guests, while minimizing hazardous situations whenever
possible and responding appropriately to emergency situations.
• Your employer - Perform the duties outlined and taught to you when you were hired. Show dedication
in your work, commitment to your job, and perform at or above expectations. While at work, you can
expect to be evaluated on your performance on a regular basis.
• Yourself - Believe in your abilities to perform the tasks of the job. Practice your skills so that you are
capable and confident in your abilities. Seek clarification from a supervisor or lifeguard instructor if you
do not understand something. Know that you are responsible for human lives each day you show up
for work. Evaluate your own performance on a continuous basis. A professional lifeguard accepts the
responsibility of protecting the lives of others.

Accountability Through Audits
Lifeguards can be held accountable through
performance evaluations that include audits. Audits
verify that lifeguards are still maintaining their test-
ready commitment to their lifeguard training. Some
lifeguards are audited solely by their employer
while others may be audited by E&A auditors.
E&A conducts audits that evaluate lifeguard
accountability and skills performance (Figure 1.9).
Audits typically measure a lifeguard’s ability to:
• Act professionally
• Remain vigilant Figure 1.9 Professional lifeguards embrace
• Provide proactive surveillance of the assigned operational drills and audits.
Zone of Protection, and the ability to recognize
and react to a distressed guest
• Appropriate scan an assigned Zone of Protection, demonstrating recognition of a guest in distress
• Respond and manage simulated aquatic emergencies
• Protect oneself from the environment
• Demonstrate rescue readiness
• Function within your aquatic facility’s emergency action plan
Professional lifeguards embrace audit accountability as an opportunity to demonstrate all aspects of their
job. The auditing process helps you and your fellow lifeguards to prevent, recognize, and respond to aquatic
emergencies. Lifeguard accountability saves lives!
Legal Concepts That Apply
To Lifeguards
There are legal concepts that apply to you as a professional lifeguard. It is important that you understand how
these concepts apply to your job:
Abandonment – When you begin to render care, it must be continued until emergency medical services (EMS)
personnel or someone with equal or greater training arrives and takes over. You can be held legally responsible for
abandoning a person who requires ongoing care if they leave the scene or stop providing care.

--- Page 25 Text ---
Introduction to Lifeguarding 13
Confidentiality - While rendering care to a guest, you may learn something about the injured or ill person, such as
personal information about medical conditions, physical problems and medications taken. This person has a right
to privacy and is protected by laws that require you to keep information confidential. The media, investigators,
law enforcement, attorneys and even insurance companies, may ask questions following an incident. This
information should not be shared with anyone except EMS personnel directly associated with the person’s care.
Sharing someone’s personal medical information with individuals not directly associated with the care of the
injured person may constitute a breach of the victim’s privacy and could cause legal problems.
Consent – Permission to render appropriate first aid emergency care. Verbally seek consent to provide care to
a responsive (conscious) guests in distress who needs first aid. The guest’s consent is referred to as informed
consent. This does not apply to guests who are unresponsive (unconscious) or confused. In such cases it is implied
(implied consent) that the guest would give approval to receive care if he or she were able to do so.
Documentation - Properly documenting injuries and incidents is critical. If legal action occurs later, your facility
records and reports can provide a legal record of what happened. It is important to compete any required witness
and incident forms as soon as possible after an incident occurs. Ideally this would happen immediately after the
incident has ended so that details are fresh in the memory of everyone involved. As time passes, critical details
may be forgotten. When completing a report, each person writing a statement, must clearly document the facts
of the incident without opinions. Once the report is complete, it should be signed and dated. The facility will
maintain copies of the reports for their record as they are likely to become legal records for any investigation.
Duty to Act - While on the job, you have a legal responsibility to act in an emergency by responding and
rendering appropriate care. Failure to adhere to this duty could result in legal action.
Negligence –When a guest is injured or suffers additional harm because of your actions or inactions, you may
be considered negligent. Negligence may include failure to prevent or control any behaviors that could result in
further harm, failure to provide appropriate care, and/or rendering care beyond the scope of your training.
Refusal of care – Sometimes, guests who are injured or sick may refuse assistance even though they desperately
need it. Also, parents may refuse care for their children. If this occurs, try to convince them why care is necessary.
If you are unsuccessful, contact your supervisor if one is readily available. You will have to respect their decision
but with proper documentation. For significant injuries, you should call EMS to evaluate the situation. For non-
life-threatening emergencies, when care is refused, make it clear that you are not denying or withholding care,
but that the guest does not wish to have the care. Document the refusal and get the guest’s signature indicating
the refusal of care.
Standard of care – Standard of Care refers to the degree of care that a responsible person is expected to provide
to prevent further harm and/ or manage the injury or illness for a guest in need. In your case, the standard of
care considers the practices of what equally qualified lifeguards would have done if placed in the same or similar
circumstance.

--- Page 26 Text ---
Introduction to Lifeguarding 14
Standard Of Care
Guests that come to a facility have a right to
expect that the lifeguards working are competent
and attentive with a purpose to protect them
while they are swimming.
As a lifeguard, you work to uphold the standard of
care expected of you. How you perform your job
will be measured against the standard currently
expected in the aquatic industry. In the event
you are involved in an incident that ends up in
court, you could be expected to demonstrate
your competency and awareness at the time of
Figure 1.10 Preventive actions including proactive
the incident. Pro actively scanning your zone and
scanning can help avoid litigation.
performing all skills to a high level of competency
can help avoid litigation (Figure 1.10).
The E&A lifeguard standard of care includes, but is not limited to:
• Consistently delivering proactive swimmer protection
• Acting in a professional manner
• Being test-ready for all lifeguard skills
• Knowing how to appropriately use all available equipment
• Taking workplace measures to mitigate risks arising from on-the-job hazards
• Executing a facility’s Emergency Action Plan effectively as an individual or team
Lifeguard Liability
The cost of not maintaining a standard of care is beyond measure when weighed against the lives and welfare
of the guests in your facility. Failing to act by not responding or not rendering the appropriate care may make
you criminally or civilly responsible.
As a lifeguard, there is a possibility that you may be involved in a serious situation that could result in a fatality.
And if that occurs, there is likely going to be an investigation and litigation that follows the event. If there is a
lawsuit over the incident, it is not likely to be resolved quickly. The litigation could last several years and may
impact you emotionally, physically, and financially.

--- Page 27 Text ---
Introduction to Lifeguarding 15
There are several steps you can follow to help reduce the post-traumatic stress associated with being a part of
a drowning event:
• Complete the incident report promptly
and accurately
• Reflect on the positive steps you did during
the event
• Exercise to help reduce stress
• Expect to have questioning sessions with
authorities as part of the post incident
investigation process; do not let yourself feel
intimidated
• Prepare for media coverage - The media will
not have all the facts, so do not comment
• Resume your familiar routines at work,
Figure 1.11 Reduce post-traumatic stress by sharing
school, and with family
the experience with other team members.
• Share support with other lifeguards on the
team experiencing the same trauma as you
(Figure 1.11)
• Ask for help if you need it
• Take advantage of any support counselors or
trained mental health professionals available to
help you cope with a traumatic experience
• Consider long term counseling services if you feel
you need additional support

Lifeguard Appearance And Behavior
As a lifeguard, you are a highly-visible facility employee. You need to project a positive professional image to
guests, demonstrating how seriously you are committed to safety and your job. When guests view you as a
professional, they are more likely to follow your directions.
These lifeguard behaviors identify you as a professional:
• Being Prepared – Always have the items you need to do the job such as a uniform, whistle, rescue tube,
stocked hip pack, hydration supplies and if outdoors, sun protection
• Rescue Ready – Maintain your skills at a test-ready level
• Safety Aware – Take proactive measures to
maintain your personal safety by adhering
to good pool habits, taking measures that
limit hazards and using personal protective
equipment when appropriate
• Vigilant – Always keep your eyes on your
assigned Zone of Protection area and avoid
distractions (Fig 2.1)
• Identifiable – Dress in a neat, clean uniform
to always look professional so guests can Figure 2.1 Professional lifeguards are alert, attentive
easily recognize you and vigilant, always ready to respond.
• Punctuality – As a professional, you must be
on time to work, returning from breaks, and rotating shifts
• Team Member – Be courteous and work together with your fellow lifeguards and co-workers
• Focus on Health – You must meet specific physical requirements to complete your lifeguard training.
Beyond your training, you need to remain in good physical and mental condition to perform the tasks
of your job. You may want to consider participating in a wellness program that encourages strength,
flexibility, and cardiovascular fitness. Regular exercise helps you to remain alert, cope with stress and
fatigue, and conditions you to perform strenuous rescues. Wellness also encourages proper nutrition and
weight control. Good nutrition helps provide you with the energy needed to remain vigilant and active.
Drinking plenty of water prevents dehydration, especially while working in hot environments. Be sure to
get adequate rest which increases your ability to be alert and ready to perform your job.

• Guest Ambassador – As a professional lifeguard,
you are a guest ambassador who interacts in
a cordial and polite way with guests creating
positive guest experiences. Always model and
enforce the rules consistently in a positive
manner when addressing guests. Know and
follow your facilities policies and procedures

They do not appear ready to respond and may not
even know how to act if called upon to do so. Unprofessional lifeguards tend to be inattentive, rude when
addressing guests, and do not appear to be concerned about their appearance or being a team member.
These behaviors identify a lifeguard as unprofessional:
• Using mobile devices while on duty
• Not actively watching the assigned zone consistently while at a station
• Having extensive conversations while at a station
• Not attending training
• Being under the influence of alcohol, other drugs, or medications that inhibit abilities
• Leaving a lifeguard station unattended
• Not rotating stations properly

Lifeguard Uniform
Lifeguard uniforms are unique to each facility. The
standard lifeguard uniform typically includes personal
safety equipment that protects both you and the
guests in your facility. Your employer will provide the
specifics on the standard lifeguard uniform for your
facility. Lifeguard uniforms might include items such
as: (Fig 2.3).
• Bathing suit/shorts or trunks – Appropriate
attire to enter the water and execute rescues
• Shirt – An item of clothing that provides protection
from weather elements and includes a name or
logo identifying you as a lifeguard
• Hat/visor – Most often used outdoors, providing
protection from sunlight exposure and other
weather elements Figure 2.3 Professional lifeguards are always dressed
• Polarized sunglasses – A personal accessory in the proper uniform.
that provides proper eye protection from
harmful ultraviolet rays and is critical for outdoor
lifeguards working in sunny conditions
Lifeguard Equipment
As a lifeguard, you will be issued standard equipment for use at your facility such as:
• Rescue tube – Helps identify you as a lifeguard and is critical when responding to water emergencies
• Whistle – The primary emergency communication device used by lifeguards. It is also used to
communicate with guests and other lifeguards
• Hip pack – Provides convenient storage and quick access to Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) used in
emergency situations
• Sun protection – Includes items such as umbrella, sunscreen, and protective clothing and eyewear
Rescue Tube
Professional lifeguards carry rescue tubes while working. Rescue tubes help identify you as the lifeguard on
duty. The rescue tube is safe, lightweight, and an effective lifesaving device for situations requiring rescues from
the water (Fig 2.4).

--- Page 33 Text ---
Professional Image and Actions 21
Using a rescue tube has advantages such as:
• The ability to support several large people in
the water
• Reducing the amount of energy that you must
expend when bringing one or more guests in
distress to safety
• Provides lifeguard safety. Positioned between
you and a guest, the rescue tube reduces the
likelihood that the guest will grab you during a
rescue. And if a guest does happen to grab you,
the rescue tube is likely to keep both you and
the guest above water
Figure 2.4 A Rescue Tube is an important piece of

tube so that rescue breathing can be provided
in the water when necessary
• The ability to support a backboard in the water while performing extrications in which spinal injury is suspected
Because each facility has unique operating procedures, your facility will provide specific site training on how to
wear your tube in unique work locations. Normally, the shoulder strap attached to the rescue tube should fit
diagonally across your chest with the excess cord secured in your hand. The rescue tube may be held:
• In front of you while standing or roving
• At your side while standing or roving
• Across your lap while sitting
In some situations, such as open water elevated guard stands, it may not be practical to hold or wear the
rescue tube. The tube is positioned so that it is immediately accessible to the lifeguard if needed.
Whistle
Your whistle provides you with the ability to
immediately grab the attention of guests due to the
loud, piercing sound that it creates. Whistles are
attached to lanyards that can be easily worn around
your neck so that they are readily available when
needed.
Hip Pack Figure 2.5 Hip packs store emergency supplies that are
easily accessible.
Hip packs are an accessory that you will carry to provide immediate access to stored emergency supplies.
These packs can be accessed while in the water or on land. While in the water, you can quickly retrieve
resuscitation masks used to provide rescue breathing (Fig 2.5).

Sun Protection
Skin cancer is the most common preventable cancer in the United States. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control
(CDC) reports that nearly five million people are treated for skin cancer annually. Since many lifeguards work
outdoors in direct sunlight, there is a real concern that exposure to the sun’s ultraviolet rays can result in
potential vision and skin damage. You can take steps to protect yourself from this threat by practicing safe
behaviors that minimize your risks. Practicing good sun safety when lifeguarding outdoors includes taking a
layered approach to protection from the sun.
Dermatologists recommend a “broad spectrum” sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30.
This will provide the best protection against the sun’s rays that can cause overall skin damage. And because
you are working in and around water, you may also consider wearing waterproof or water-resistant sunscreen.
• Waterproof sunscreen is capable of
maintaining its SPF rating for 80 minutes
when exposed to water
• Water resistant sunscreen is capable of
maintaining its SPF rating for 40 minutes
when exposed to water
Whichever sunscreen you choose, be sure to
reapply it frequently based on your sun exposure
during work (Fig 2.6).
Figure 2.6 Sunscreen provides critical protection for
lifeguards working outdoors.

• Work under a shaded area or umbrella
• Wear a hat and sunglasses
• Wear a shirt that provides additional skin protection
• Apply a broad spectrum sunscreen with at least a 30 SPF for exposed skin
• Reapply sunscreen frequently to maintain protection
Positive Guest Interactions
Professional lifeguards provide positive guest interactions that make guests feel welcome. To make guests feel
welcome in your facility, practice the “Golden Rule.”
This means treating others as you would want to be
treated - with courtesy and respect.
Most likely, you’ll find yourself working with the
public and co-workers in a diverse, multicultural
environment. It’s important that you treat everyone
with equal respect and consideration. Always keep an
open mind. Be open to suggestions from guests, as
well as other staff members who come from diverse
backgrounds and cultures. Avoid being judgmental
and biased based on your own personal background

open-minded lifeguard you are, the easier it will be
for you to deliver a safe, enjoyable experience that creates positive guest interactions (Fig 2.7).
Lifeguards CARE for Their Facility Guests
As an E&A Lifeguard, you can deliver positive guest interactions by genuinely caring for the guests in your facility.
CARE means being:
• Confident in your ability to maintain a test-ready skill level by enhancing your development through ongoing
training participation
• Attentive to your Zone of Protection Area while on duty, anticipating and preventing potential issues (weak
swimmers, crowded conditions, surface glare)
• Responsive when faced with an emergency that requires you to quickly assess a situation and determine the
best course of action. This includes identifying the type of care to render and the proper use of emergency
equipment.

--- Page 36 Text ---
Professional Image and Actions 24
• Empathetic by placing yourself in the guest’s position, understanding their needs and emotions. Always
make eye contact and act courteously and respectfully. Appreciate the physical and emotional concerns a
guest may have.
Lifeguards DEAL With Difficult Situations
Occasionally, you may encounter a difficult guest. Determine if you need help from a supervisor or if you can
DEAL with the situation on your own (Fig 2.8):
• De-escalate the situation – Start with a clear understanding of the guest’s concern. You can gain an
understanding by listening carefully without interrupting the guest and then ask questions to clarify what
you heard. Summarize what you heard to be certain the problem is clearly stated.
• Evaluate alternatives – Examine the options available to help with the guest’s concern. Consider the
consequences of each option. Ask the guest how he or she would like the situation resolved. Discuss options
for possible resolutions.
• Act quickly – Based on the information you
gather, and after considering your options, take
action to improve the situation. Be specific when
explaining to the guest what you are going to do
and why you are doing it. Be clear to everyone
involved in the situation of the actions you are
taking.
• Look at outcomes – Evaluate how effective
your action was afterward. Consider whether
the guest left satisfied. Consider how you may

have done a better job of handling the difficult
situation. Guests may not always leave happy
when you are enforcing a rule, but how you enforce it can change the experience for a guest. Evaluating the
outcome of each situations a learning opportunity.
Each facility is unique and may provide additional customer service training. You may work with a lifeguard
team and may have a supervisor to assist you when needed. If you are in doubt about your authority or ability
to provide positive guest interactions, seek the assistance of a supervisor and/or fellow lifeguard.
Rule Enforcement
All aquatic facilities have rules to reduce and minimize risks or potential hazards These rules are established
by authorities that have jurisdiction over the facility such as local health departments, municipalities, state
regulatory agencies, and manufacturers of specific attractions. Some rules and regulations come from facility

--- Page 37 Text ---
Professional Image and Actions 25
policies. As a lifeguard, you have the important responsibility of consistently enforcing the rules that have been
designed to keep your facility guests safe. Rules are posted on signs throughout your facility. You should know
where these signs are located and what each sign says (Fig 2.9).
Rules Keep Guests Safe
Rules are established to prevent potential risks
and injury. At times, rule enforcement can seem
difficult because the guests who visit an aquatic
facility are there to have fun and may not be
aware they are breaking a rule. This is where your
professionalism comes into play. Address all guests
in a friendly, courteous, but direct manner so they
remain safe.
Whenever you interact with guests, make it your Figure 2.9 Consistency in rule enforcement is an
goal to keep the conversation positive. An example important responsibility of lifeguards.
of this would be stating “Please walk” instead of
“No running!” Or “Please go down the slide, feet
first,” instead of saying, “No head first sliding.”
Besides simply enforcing rules, it also helps to be able to explain the rules. If guests understand the reasoning
for a rule, they are more likely to follow it. For example, if you say, “For your safety, please walk, this area can
become slippery,” you are explaining why they shouldn’t run.
Lifeguards LEAD
Whenever you are handing situations that involve rule enforcement, use the LEAD approach:
• Listen to guests’ concerns about rules without interrupting them
• Empathize with guests regarding how they may feel
• Apologize for any misunderstanding about rules on their behalf
• Discuss the rule, and provide guests with options if available

General Environmental Safety
While working as a lifeguard, you will be exposed to many potential physical risks. Your personal safety must
come first. If you are not safe, you will not be able to aid others when needed. Practicing safe behaviors can
help minimize environmental risk factors in your work place. Some of these risk factors include sun-exposure,
dehydration, weather-related incidents, and exposure to chemicals. This chapter covers environmental risk
factors and general safety measures that you should follow. Once employed as a lifeguard, your facility may
provide training unique to your specific work environment.
Facility Type
You may work in indoor or outdoor facilities, or both. Each work environment has unique risk factors that you
should be familiar with:
• Indoor aquatic facilities have air ventilation systems designed to heat and circulate air in the facility to
maximize guest comfort. These systems create a warm, climate-controlled environment with elevated air
temperature and higher humidity levels
• Outdoor facilities are likely to experience greater changes in air temperature and humidity. These facilities
are also impacted by wind, rain, and direct sunlight
Weather Conditions
Weather is an environmental risk that lifeguards
are exposed to while working. Weather is
unpredictable and can change quickly. Weather
affects your safety and that of facility guests.
When faced with a weather-related emergency in
your facility, take immediate action. Even indoor
facilities may be impacted by weather-related
emergencies such as losing power during a storm.
Each facility has unique procedures for shutdown
and managing weather situations. Be prepared.
Your facility Emergency Action Plan (EAP) provides
direction as to how to respond during such
emergencies (Figure 3.1).
Figure 3.1 Some facility attractions may close during
Examples of weather-related emergencies that you severe weather for safety.
are likely to face include:
• Sun exposure • High wind
• Rain • Tornados
• Thunderstorms • Other unique conditions

--- Page 41 Text ---
Environmental Safety 29
Sun
Overexposure to the sun is a preventable environmental risk. Continued exposure to sun can cause sunburn,
dehydration, fatigue, heat-related injuries and long-term damage to skin such as skin cancer. To prevent these
potential risks, take a layered approach to sun protection while working in outdoor environments (Figure 3.2):
• Work in a shaded area or under an umbrella
• Wear a hat/visor
• Wear sunglasses with polarized lenses
• Wear a shirt as part of your uniform
• Apply sunscreen with an SPF broad factor of
30 frequently to all exposed skin
Rain
Light rain can have an impact on your ability to
fully see and protect your assigned zone. When
rain falls on the surface of the water in your

visibility of the water below the surface. Notify
your supervisor immediately if you lose the ability
to see beneath the water’s surface. If visual observation of the bottom of the pool is lost, check with your
supervisor. It may be necessary to close the pool until weather conditions improve.
Thunderstorms
Thunderstorms are dangerous and considered a weather-related emergency. Thunder and lightning, typically
accompanied by heavy rain or hail, are more frequent in the summer months or in warmer climates. Lightning
can strike from as far as 10 to15 miles away and a single lightning strike can reach over five miles in length.
Your facility will have a specific Emergency Action Plan (EAP) in the event of a thunderstorm that will include
procedures for closing the facility. There are multiple methods of determining if lightning poses an imminent
threat, including lightning detection devices, website resources, smart phone apps, and counting time between
strikes. Once it is determined that your facility needs to shut down, you must work quickly and safely to move
guests to a secure and safe location (Figure 3.3).

--- Page 42 Text ---
Environmental Safety 30
Figure 3.3 Work quickly to keep guests safe if your facility determines the need to shut down during severe weather.
Shelter During Thunderstorms
• If outside, take shelter in a building, completely enclosed structure, or hardtop vehicle
• Protect yourself from lightning - avoid shelter areas that are not fully enclosed
• Once guests are secure indoors, advise them to stay clear of metal objects, plumbing and even land
lines. All three can conduct electricity from a direct lightning strike
• Check with the National Weather Service or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
for additional information about lightning safety
Wind
Wind can agitate the water’s surface enough to affect your ability to see the pool bottom. Wind gusts can be
dangerous, resulting in flying objects like furniture, umbrellas, towels, water bottles, and other items that
are not secured. Your Emergency Action Plan (EAP) provides procedures in case wind conditions become
dangerous. Normally, this includes clearing the facility of loose items, closing umbrellas and securing
equipment.
Tornados
A tornado is a violently rotating column of air that is typically part of a larger thunderstorm. When
conditions are right, a tornado can strike anywhere. Your facility staff will monitor the weather for tornadic
conditions. A tornado watch means that tornadoes are possible. Tornado watches are issued long before
a storm potentially reaches the area where the tornado may touch down. A tornado warning means that a
tornado has touched down.

covered shelter in the lowest point of a building, such as a basement. If a basement is not available, a hallway
or interior room without windows is a good option. Be sure you and your guests remain in the location until
the danger has passed.
Other Unique Weather Conditions
Many unique weather conditions may impact facility operations. This can include dense fog, smoke, smog
and dirt/ sand storms. As with other environmental conditions, follow your Emergency Action Plan (EAP) to
provide for the safety of your guests and yourself.
Hydration
Staying hydrated keeps lifeguards alert and vigilant.
Inadequate hydration can lead to dehydration, a
loss of body fluid that leads to fatigue. Drink plenty
of fluids throughout your shift to avoid the effects
of dehydration. To help you remain hydrated, keep
a water bottle available and drink frequently while
working (Figure 3.4).
When working in hot environments, take a dip in
the water after a rotation is complete or apply a
cool towel to your head and neck.
Figure 3.4 Staying hydrated is critical to maintaining your
focus.
Chemical Safety
Your safety and that of your guests comes first.
That’s why the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) requires that employers
implement a Hazard Communication Standard to
reduce and prevent injury and illness resulting
from exposure to chemicals. This standard is
met by requiring facilities to provide and make
available Safety Data Sheets (SDS) for each
chemical. These sheets must be easily accessible
and include procedures for handling exposure
to each substance, along with first aid measures
and medical care requirements if exposure occurs Figure 3.5 Read the labels and placards to help identify
(Figure 3.5).
the hazards regarding chemicals in your facility.

Environmental Safety 32
Lifeguards have a Right to Know!
• What hazardous chemicals are in their facility
• What Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is needed
• Where the chemicals are stored in the facility
when using the chemicals
• How to properly store the chemicals
• How to handle the chemicals
• The risks and dangers of each chemical
• How to handle exposure and what treatment is needed
• How to protect themselves from the chemical • Where the Safety Data Sheets (SDS) are located
Water Chemistry
Water chemistry in a pool is important to swimmer safety. Not only does it impact the water clarity for you to
safely see your zone, but it can also affect whether or not contaminants like bacteria from recreational water
borne illnesses are able to live and grow in the water. There are many factors that contribute to the ability to
maintain proper water chemistry including sunlight, air temperature, wind, rain, number of guests, bodily fluids,
and lotions.
A Certified Pool Operator (CPO) or an Aquatic
Facility Operator (AFO) will handle the responsibility
of managing the facility’s water chemistry, adjusting
chemicals, and maintaining the filtration system. As
part of your lifeguard responsibilities, you may also
be required to test the water to ensure it is in the
proper operating ranges. If this is to be part of your
job, you will be trained by your facility to test and
possibly adjust the chemicals while maintaining your
safety (Figure 3.6).
Water Quality in Pools and Figure 3.6 You may take regular chemical readings as a
part of your secondary job duties.
Hot Tubs
One of the most important tasks of the swimming pool operator is diligently monitoring the pH and free chlorine
level of pool water to maintain water quality. Chlorine (in some form) is one of the most common chemicals
used to disinfect water. When dissolved in water, chlorine disinfects and sanitizes the water by killing germs
and oxidizing contaminants. To work most effectively, the required concentration of chlorine must always be
maintained. Typically, the ideal (normal) free chlorine range is 1.0-3.0 parts per million (ppm) but this may vary
by pool type, conditions and local regulations.
pH stands for potential Hydrogen. pH is measured on a scale that runs from 0 to 14. Seven is neutral, meaning
there is a balance between acidity and alkalinity. If the pH is above 7, the water is more basic (alkaline), and if it
is below 7 the water is more acidic. The optimum pH for pool water is typically at or near 7.4. This level provides
for good chlorine disinfection. As the pH increases towards 8, the effectiveness of the chlorine tends to decrease.
When the pH goes below 7.2, the water becomes increasingly aggressive and may corrode pool surfaces and
equipment.

--- Page 45 Text ---
Environmental Safety 33
Water Quality in Natural Body of Water Facilities
Facilities with a natural body of water include lakes, streams, rivers, and ocean fronts. Each of these types of
facilities have their own unique water quality concerns. Natural body water facilities can be affected by algae
blooms and pollutants such as runoff from heavy storms, industrial waste, oil spills, wildlife waste, fertilizer,
pesticides, boating waste, and littering.
Recreational Waterborne Illnesses
Recreational waterborne illnesses (RWIs) are spread to humans when they swallow, breath or come in contact
with contaminated water. Typical signs can include skin rashes, ear aches, and diarrhea. Some cases, however,
can result in pneumonia, neurological damage, and even death.
Common RWI’s are caused by Norovirus, E-Coli, and Giardia. These gastro intestinal viruses are highly contagious
and have similar symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dehydration. Another
RWI is Cryptosporidium, commonly known as Crypto. It comes from a microscopic parasite and can remain
infectious for several days even when living in sanitized, disinfected pool water. RWI’s from viruses and parasites
can occur when feces are released into the water and this contaminated water is inadvertently swallowed.
Fecal Incidents in Your Facility
Your facility will have a protocol outlined for handling accidental fecal release (AFRs) incidents. During your
orientation, or in-service training, your facility should provide training on how to respond to AFRs. The Centers
for Disease Control (CDC) and Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC) provide guidance on the proper way to
handle AFRs and maintain healthy swimming facilities (Table 3.1).
Table 3.1 Handling Accidental Fecal Release Incidents
The general care steps for AFRs are:
1. Close the aquatic attraction where the event occurred
2. Remove as much of the fecal matter as possible using a net/scoop and dispose of it
3. Contact the person responsible for water chemistry and filtration
4. Properly sanitize equipment used before placing it back in service
5. Wait for instructions regarding when to reopen the attraction

--- Page 46 Text ---
Environmental Safety 34
Other types of Water Contaminants
Other types of infectious contaminants may enter your facility’s water. Guests may become injured or ill while
visiting which may cause blood and/or vomit to be deposited in your water. Although guests are less likely to
contract an RWI by swallowing, breathing or contacting water that is contaminated by vomit or blood, these
bodily fluids are considered infectious and pose risks if the water chemistry does not have a proper disinfectant
level. As a lifeguard, you may be responsible for cleaning up these types of bio spills when they occur in or
around their water. Cleaning up vomit and or blood is like cleaning up a well-formed accidental fecal release.

FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
Your work environment poses several risks and hazards that you should be aware of while on the job. As a lifeguard,
it is your responsibility to protect yourself and your guests from the risks and hazards in your work environment.
Your personal safety comes first. You should ensure that you protect yourself from the sun by taking a layered
approach each time you are working outdoors, and always remain hydrated by drinking water when on duty.
Each environment poses different challenges to your safety and health and that of your guests.
Be aware of the general weather patterns unique to your location and follow your EAP regarding thunderstorms,
lightning and other severe weather situations.
Your job brings you in contact with chemicals which are used to keep the water in your facility sanitary and to
keep your facility clean. Whenever you use a chemical, you should review the facility Safety Data Sheet (SDS) to
be aware of the proper handling procedures and exposure protocols for the chemical.
If you are responsible for testing the water chemistry and adjusting chemicals, your facility will provide you
specific training in operating procedures.
Recreational waterborne illnesses (RWIs) are caused by germs spread through contaminated water in your facility.
RWIs can cause a wide variety of infections, including gastrointestinal, skin, ear, respiratory, eye, neurologic and
wound infections. RWIs can contain highly contagious infections and some that may even be life-threatening.
Most common RWIs include diarrheal illnesses such as E-Coli, Norovirus, Giardia and cryptosporidium.
Be aware of your facility’s procedures for handling accidental fecal release and bio-spills in and around the water
to minimize the risk of exposure and harm from RWIs.

Preventing Disease Transmission 37
Bloodborne And Airborne Pathogens
Bacteria and viruses are pathogens (germs) present in blood and other bodily fluids. Bacteria and viruses can
live on surfaces outside the body for varying periods of time. The Hepatitis C virus can live outside the body for
as much as 6 weeks. These pathogens can cause various diseases if they infect humans. Some pathogens can
be prevented with vaccines. Medications such as antibiotics and anti-viral agents are used to treat bacterial or
viral infections once they occur. But not all infections can be treated effectively.
The bloodborne pathogens of primary concern to you are viruses, specifically Hepatitis B and C virus and
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The airborne pathogens of concern include tuberculosis, chickenpox,
measles, mumps, and meningitis. Tables 4.1 and 4.2 provide detailed information on these pathogens.

Preventing Disease Transmission 39
How Diseases Are Transmitted
There are three conditions that must be met for disease transmission to occur:
• The pathogen must be present in adequate quantity to cause disease
• A person must be susceptible to the pathogen
• The pathogen must enter the body through an opening such as the eyes, nose, mouth, skin cuts,
abrasions, bites, or needlestick puncture
You risk disease transmission from bloodborne
pathogens when providing emergency care such
as controlling bleeding (Figure 4.1). Transmission
can occur if infected blood splashes in your eyes or
mouth, or if you touch the infected guest’s blood
without gloves when your hand has an open sore.
You risk transmission of airborne pathogens
if an infected guest coughs or sneezes in your
unprotected face or needs rescue breathing.
Transmission of select viruses and bacteria can
occur through direct contact with the guest
Figure 4.1 You risk infection from bloodborne pathogens
(e.g. saliva or blisters) or indirect contact with
when providing emergency care that involves bleeding.
a contaminated object such as soiled clothing,
or rescue supplies when not wearing personal
protective equipment.
Disease transmission can also occur when the skin is penetrated by an infectious source, such as an insect
bite or sting. Examples of diseases spread in this manner include malaria and West Nile virus spread through
mosquito bites.
OSHA Protection Standards
As a lifeguard, your job has the potential for contact with blood or other potentially infectious material
(OPIM). The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) established regulations to
protect employees from on-the-job exposure to bloodborne and airborne pathogens and OPIM. This includes
reducing or removing hazards from your workplace that may place you in contact with infectious materials.
The regulations are known as:
• OSHA’s Bloodborne Pathogens Standard 29 CFR 1910.1040
• OSHA Respiratory Protection Standard 29 CFR 1910.334
Since your job has tasks with a potential for occupational exposure to blood and OPIM, you must receive
training to reduce or eliminate these hazards through protective measures. Training is required annually, or
earlier if your job responsibilities, equipment or practices change.

--- Page 52 Text ---
Preventing Disease Transmission 40
OSHA’s standards require that your employer protect you when you are doing your job. This includes:
• Identifying duties that you will perform that fall within the protection offered by the standards
• Establishing an Exposure Control Plan that includes protective measures to follow to minimize the chance
of disease transmission
• Seeking your input into engineering and work practice controls
• Offering access to the Hepatitis B vaccination
• Creating a system of recordkeeping that tracks required training and exposure incidents
• Creating protocols to follow in the event of an exposure incident
• Implementing a schedule for cleaning and decontaminating the workplace
• Implementing a system to identify and properly dispose of soiled material
• Ensuring confidentiality of your medical records and any exposure incidents
Disease Prevention Practices
Disease prevention practices are made up of:
• Administrative controls
• Engineering controls
• Work practice controls
• Standard precautions
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
Administrative Controls
Administrative controls include the programs and
policies that support and direct the overall disease
prevention plan. Your facility’s training program,
vaccination program, and exposure control plan are
examples of administrative controls.
Engineering Controls
Efforts implemented to minimize disease transmission
through workspace design or equipment use are
Figure 4.2 Engineering controls involve workplace design and
known as engineering controls. Examples include self-
equipment to minimize the chances for disease transmission.
sheathing needles, hand and eye washing stations,
biohazard waste containers, sharps containers, and spill clean-up kits (Figure 4.2). When washing stations are
not feasible, other options must be available, such as antiseptic hand cleaner or eye irrigation bottles.

--- Page 53 Text ---
Preventing Disease Transmission 41
Work Practice Controls
Behaviors (practices) that are required to implement engineering controls are known as work practice
controls. Properly using washing stations, sharps containers, and waste containers are examples of work
practice controls. Specific work practice controls include protocols that:
• Provide steps for removing soiled medical exam gloves (Table 4.3)
• Provide steps for cleaning up sharp items and contaminated spills
• Require hands to be immediately washed after removing soiled medical exam gloves
• Require that you clean and disinfect equipment and surfaces if soiled

3. Rub your hands vigorously for at least 15 seconds, covering all surfaces.
4. Rinse with warm water.
5. Dry thoroughly.

--- Page 54 Text ---
Preventing Disease Transmission 42
If you are cleaning up a spill mixed with sharp objects such as broken glass and needles, do not pick these up
with your hands. Use a broom, dustpan or cardboard to properly remove the broken glass and deposit it in the
proper container (Figure 4.3). Use a disinfectant to clean the surface of any remaining blood. If you must make
a disinfectant, prepare a mixture of 1 part bleach to 9 parts water. Flood the area and allow it to stand for
approximately 15 minutes. Wipe up the remaining solution and dispose of it in a labeled biohazard container.
Figure 4.3a Deposit sharp objects such as broken glass and Figure 4.3b Deposit all soiled materials in properly labeled
needles in puncture proof containers. biohazard bags.
Standard Precautions
Standard precautions are standardized safety measures that assume that all bodily fluids may be infectious,
so precautions must always be taken. Standard precautions can be applied to engineering and work practice
controls and to the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE).
Personal Protective Equipment
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) will be available
to you so that you can safely perform your job as a
lifeguard. PPE prevents blood and OPIM from coming
into contact with your exposed skin or mucous
membranes while you provide care. PPE includes
items that prevent direct contact with potentially
infectious materials such as (Figure 4.4):
• Breathing devices
• Suction devices
• Medical exam gloves
• Face masks
• Gowns
• Eye protection Figure 4.4 Personal protective equipment (PPE) is provided
to keep you safe when providing care.

--- Page 55 Text ---
Preventing Disease Transmission 43
Guidelines for using PPE to prevent infection include:
• Follow Standard Precautions when using PPE
• Avoid handling items such as radios when wearing soiled gloves
• Do not eat, drink or touch your mouth, nose or eyes when giving care
• Change gloves before providing care to additional guests
• Wear protective coverings to avoid blood splatter from serious bleeding
About Gloves
Regardless of the type of medical exam gloves you use (non-latex or latex), none have been found to
be impermeable to bacteria and viruses. And all gloves have the potential to fail (tear). This is why
handwashing immediately after glove removal is recommended.
Because of increased concerns of latex allergies, you are most likely to have non-latex gloves available
when providing emergency care. This protects both the responders and the guests when care is provided.
If An Exposure Occurs
Disease prevention strategies are designed to minimize the likelihood of an exposure while you are on the job.
If you suffer an occupational exposure, follow the guidelines below for immediate care and report the incident
according to your facility’s Exposure Control Plan.
If you suffer an exposure, immediately take the following steps:
1. Clean the contaminated area, including any penetrating injuries involving cuts or punctures thoroughly
with soap and water
2. If you are splashed with blood or OPIM around or in your mouth, nose, or eyes, flush the area
thoroughly with water
3. Report the exposure incident to your supervisor immediately and to the EMS personnel if they are
arriving to take over care of the guest
4. Document with your supervisor what happened. Include the time, date, and circumstances of the
exposure as well the immediate actions taken post exposure
5. Seek immediate follow-up care with a qualified health care professional according to your facility’s
exposure control plan. The evaluation will determine the best course of treatment

--- Page 56 Text ---
Preventing Disease Transmission 44
Exposure Control Plan
Your facility is responsible for maintaining an
exposure control plan. This written plan outlines
protective measures used at your facility to eliminate
or minimize exposure incidents. If an exposure does
occur, the exposure control plan states how to report
the exposure and what to do next. The plan also
details how your employer will maintain records
according to OSHA requirements (Figure 4.5).
See Appendix B for a sample exposure control plan.
Figure 4.5 If you suffer an exposure, report it to your
supervisor who will instruct you according to the facility’s
exposure control plan.

Health Codes, Laws And Standards
Health codes, laws, and standards exist to
provide direction and guidelines for how to best
design, and safely operate aquatic facilities. Your State Codes
facility’s management personnel are responsible
for knowing the industry standards that apply
to the facility in which you work. They are also
responsible for establishing operating procedures

all the procedures and rules established by
Rules
management to keep your guests safe (Figure 5.1).
Here are some examples of the codes, laws, and
standards that provide safe operating guidance:
• Model Aquatic Health Code Manufacturer
Manuals
• Local or State Swimming Pool Codes and
Regulations
• American Society for Testing and Standards Figure 5.1 Health codes, laws and standards are used to
(now ASTM International) create facility rules and regulations.
• Manufacturer Manuals
Model Aquatic Health Code
The Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC) is a
voluntary guidance document based on science and
best practices that helps local and state authorities
and aquatics facilities to provide healthy and safe
swimming and other water activities. States and
localities can use the MAHC to create or update
existing pool codes to reduce risk for outbreaks,
drowning, and pool-chemical injuries.

Most states or towns and municipalities have public swimming pool regulations. The regulations are enforced
by the local Health Department. These regulations typically list the type of lifeguard training requirements
needed to work in a facility, facility design elements and equipment, how to handle bio-spills and RWIs, and
acceptable water chemistry requirements for operation.

Guest Safety 48
ASTM International
The American Society of Testing and Materials International provides a set of industry standards that provide
guidance for amusement devices. There are specific standards for maintenance and operation for aquatic
facilities operating water slides, and water tree house attraction elements. These standards offer facility
management guidance on how to operate in accordance with the builder/manufacture of the aquatic Play
attraction.
Original Equipment Manufacturers Operations and
Maintenance Manual
The manual that comes from the builder of the attraction is known as the Original Equipment Manufacturers
Operations and Maintenance Manual. Manuals such as these typically provide direction on how to operate,
maintain, and repair the attraction. They provide recommended restrictions or limitations for attractions like
waterslides. These manuals also provide Information on when to dispatch (send) riders on the slide, how riders
should participate on the slide, and what information should be placed on signage to describe the ride.
Company Procedures
Company procedures are developed based on codes, laws, and standards. A company with multiple beaches,
pools, water parks and resorts will likely want all its properties to operate consistently. Sometimes they will
select laws, codes and procedures that are the most stringent in one location and apply that standard to all
their properties to ensure consistency.
Rule Enforcement
Each facility has its own set of rules designed to
keep guests safe and prevent injuries. Your job is to
know those rules, enforce them consistently, and
follow them responsibly. When on duty, you will set
the example for your guests to follow while at your
facility (Figure 5.3).
Enforcing rules may sometimes seem difficult
because guests are visiting your facility to have
fun. Just remember that enforcing a rule is for the
guest’s safety. Some of the more common rules
found in aquatic facilities include:
Figure 5.3 When you enforce your facility rules and
• Proper swimwear required in pool

• No glass on the pool deck
• Supervise children at all times
• Please shower before entering the water
Rules should be posted in locations that are visible to all guests. Posted rules support you when you enforce
them. Whenever you must enforce a rule, do so in a positive manner. Explaining why a specific rule exists can
help guests understand the important safety reason for the rule and improve their experience.
When it comes to Rules, get in the Know
 Your facility rules
 Where rules are posted
 Why rules exist
 How to explain rules to guests
 How rules support positive guest interactions
Special Attraction Rules and Restrictions
Your facility has operational rules for the safe use of the attraction by guests, including water slides, treehouse
structures, diving boards, and surfing attractions. These rules can refer to the size and weight of the guests,
and rider configuration. If you are working at one of these types of aquatic attractions, your facility supervisors
should provide you with specific attraction training.
Examples of restrictions include:
• No weak swimmers in deep water
• Children and weak swimmers must wear a life jacket
• No swimmers in the lazy river without a tube
Shallow Water
Blackout
Sometimes guests play games in the water to
see who can hold their breath the longest while
submerged. They may breathe rapidly (hyperventilate)
in preparation for this challenge. This practice of
hyperventilating and then seeing how far or deep they
can swim underwater is dangerous because it can
lead to loss of consciousness while submerged. You
should discourage the practice of hyperventilating and
“breath-holding” activities where guests spend long
Figure 5.4 Lifeguards should monitor their zone for
amounts of time underwater. (Figure5.4)
children playing breath-holding games to prevent shallow
water blackout.

--- Page 62 Text ---
Guest Safety 50
This potentially life-threatening condition is known as Shallow Water Blackout. This blackout results from
reduced oxygen supplied to the brain. Breathing is normally triggered by the elevation of carbon dioxide (CO2).
Hyperventilating before submerging reduces the automatic response to breathe. As oxygen (O2) is depleted,
the guest can suddenly faint without feeling the need to breathe.
Secondary Drowning
Secondary drowning is sometimes called “delayed drowning,” or “silent drowning.” It is a type of drowning
that occurs following a submersion incident in which the guest appears fine at first but within 24 hours shows signs of
drowning.
Secondary drowning happens when some water is inhaled into the lungs. The signs of secondary drowning
can include:
• Difficulty breathing
• Persistent coughing
• Froth (foam/fluid) from the nose or mouth
• Choking as if drinking water that “went down the wrong tube”
• Diminished consciousness
• Anxiety
• Extreme fatigue
• Pale/bluish/gray lips and fingers
• Chest pain
• Vomiting
If you suspect a secondary drowning, don’t hesitate. Immediately call Emergency Medical Services (EMS).
Life Jackets
Drowning incidents among guests that are weak or
non-swimmers can be prevented by using life jackets.
A properly fitted and worn life jacket can keep a guest’s
head above the water surface. Life jackets should be U.S.
Coast Guard approved and in good condition. The U.S.
Coast Guard label is printed directly onto the flotation
device. The most common life jacket facilities provide
their guests has a Type II label. The inside of the life
jacket lists sizes by weight load for each type (Figure 5.5).
While some facilities may have policies allowing the Figure 5.5 Keep life jackets on display so guests see them

are not reliable flotation devices and are not U.S. Coast
Guard approved. Be on the lookout for guests who are weak or non-swimmers. Request that they wear a life
jacket as this is an established safety practice. Facilities often have life jackets available for guests. The best life
jacket is the one that is properly fitted and always worn.

--- Page 63 Text ---
Guest Safety 51
You will need to learn how to fit a guest with a life
jacket. Always enforce your facility’s policy on life
jackets and other personal flotation devices
(Figure 5.6).
Figure 5.6 Lifeguards should assist guests with properly
fitting and fastening their life jackets.
Life jackets: Finding the Right Fit
A properly fitted life jacket:
• Fits snugly but comfortably to allow for the guest’s arm movement without restricting breathing
• Does not allow a child’s chin and ears to slip through
• Is tested out by the guest in shallow water to verify the guest’s mouth does not slip below the
water’s surface
• Has all buckles connected
Life Jacket Inspections
Life jackets should be inspected daily for normal wear and tear and cleanliness. Lifejackets that show damage
should be removed from use. Look for holes, tears, and broken buckles or clips when checking a life jacket. Life
jackets should be stored in a place that allows them to dry out when not in use yet still be visible for guests. If
there is a smell of mildew, or signs of waterlogging, the life jacket should be removed.

Guest Safety 52
FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
There are numerous resources available that are used to create rules to keep aquatic facilities safe. Your facility
manager is responsible for knowing these resources and applying them to create the rules at your facility. As a
lifeguard employed at the facility, you are responsible for consistently enforcing the rules. Your facility should
provide you with the standard operating procedures for any unique attractions at your facility during your pre-
service training.
Every facility has some degree of operational risk. Understanding the risks associated with attractions at your
facility is one of the ways you will keep your guests safe. Shallow water blackout is a risk that lifeguards should
know about and try to prevent. Shallow water blackout is an underwater “faint” due to the lack of oxygen to
the brain brought on by holding one’s breath for long periods of time. Without immediate rescue, a guest that
has lost consciousness can quickly drown. You can reduce or eliminate the danger of shallow water blackout by
monitoring your zone and addressing behaviors that lead to this life-threatening risk as soon you observe them.
Prevent swimmers from playing breath-holding games and or spending long lengths of time on the bottom of
pool.
Another risk you should understand is secondary drowning, which can happen after a guest suffers a submersion
incident. The guest might feel fine at first, but then begins to show drowning signs later. If you suspect a secondary
drowning, immediately call Emergency Medical Services. Do not wait.
You can keep guests safe in and around the water by having U.S. Coast Guard approved life jackets available for
them. Be sure to inspect the life jackets daily to ensure they are in good condition and clean. Make sure guests
are wearing them properly and help any guest that needs assistance with proper fitting.

Zone of Protection 54
The 10/20 Protection Standard
The 10/20 Protection™ standard is a guiding
principle that is followed when scanning an assigned
zone. It means you are able to scan your Zone of
Protection® area within 10 seconds and if guest in
distress is recognized, you can reach the guest within
20 seconds. This standard helps lifeguards monitor
their assigned zones while also in position for a quick
response to any incident.
Recognizing and responding to the incident within
those first critical 30 seconds has proven to save lives
(Figure 6.1).
Figure 6.1 You can prevent drowning incidents when you scan
your zone using the 10/20 Protection™ standard consistently.
Lifeguard Zones
Each duty station has an assigned area of water
to monitor. These areas are known as Zone of
protection® areas, commonly called “zones.” The
size of each zone is determined by a lifeguard’s
ability to scan the entire area in 10 seconds and
reach a guest at the furthest point in the zone
within 20 seconds.
Zones are designed to overlap so that no area is left
unprotected when a team of lifeguards is working
together. Your assigned zone is your primary
responsibility. You need to know your zone and
where you and other lifeguards share overlapping
areas. You must know the extent of all the zones at Figure 6.2 Know your zone and where it overlaps with
your facility (Figure 6.2). other zones.
Creating Lifeguard Zones
The 10/20 Protection standard is the basis for deciding how large a zone can be and how many lifeguard
stations are needed to staff the entire attraction. Graphic drawings, illustrations or photographs are used to
document each zone and the lifeguard positions within these zones (Figure 6.3).
Your supervisor is responsible for making sure you understand your zones and maintain the 10/20 Protection
standard. To accomplish this, your supervisor will verify your zone meets the 10/20 Protection standard using
the Zone Validation® system which tests the physical and environmental obstructions that may be present

in your zone and your ability to recognize a guest
in distress within 10 seconds and reach the guest
within 20 seconds.
Depending on the number of guests, unique
features, weather changes, and unique situations,
adjustments to your zone may be necessary from
time to time. You should notify your supervisor if
you are unable to view your assigned zone so that
an adjustment can be made.
Figure 6.3 A Zone Coverage Diagram shows all zones and
their overlapping areas at an aquatic attraction.
Know Your Zone
Your Zone Should:
• Be able to be scanned within 10 seconds
• Be designed to reach the furthest point within 20 seconds
• Be diagrammed to clearly show the entire area of responsibility
• Clearly show any overlap with any adjacent zones
• Identify unique physical characteristics of the zone
• Consider factors that impact the 10/20 Protection Standard
• Indicate if lifeguard stations are stationary or roving
Maintaining Vigilance Within Your Zone
You are accountable for maintaining the 10/20
Protection Standard in your assigned zone which means
you must be constantly aware of the activity in your
entire zone. Scanning your area constantly means
searching the water in a manner that allows you to view
all depths of the water every 10 seconds.
Notify your supervisor immediately If for any reason you
are unable to view the entire zone within 10 seconds.
Situations that could impact your ability to adequately
scan your zone include water clarity issues, hard rain,
sun glare, and a large number of guests. Also notify your
supervisor immediately If there are factors that keep

FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
Each duty station has an assigned area of water to monitor. These areas are known as Zone of Protection®
areas, commonly called “zones”. Zones are designed using the 10/20 Protection™ standard.
The 10/20 Protection standard is a standard of care that lifeguards follow when scanning their assigned zones.
This two-step method reduces drowning rates by creating a standard that helps you monitor your zone every
few seconds while also being in the proper location for a quick response to an incident in your zone.
The 10/20 Protection atandard means you have 10 seconds to be able to scan your entire zone and recognize
any guests in distress. You have an additional 20 seconds to be able to reach any guest at the furthest point of
the zone.
Zone of Protection area documents clearly display the boundaries of a specific zone.
Before you begin working, your supervisor will verify your zone meets the 10/20 Protection Standard using
the Zone Validation® System which tests your ability to identify your zone, recognize a guest in distress, and
respond within the expected time frame.
You are always accountable for maintaining the 10/20 Protection Standard when working.

Surveillance 59
Introduction
Your primary duty as a lifeguard is to maintain the 10/20 Protection Standard which holds you accountable for
the safety of guests in your zone. To meet this duty you must remain alert and your skills must be at a “test-
ready” level to respond appropriately. In order to do your job effectively, you must know what to look for when
you’re scanning. This means knowing what a guest in distress looks like and what behaviors distressed guests
exhibit. In this section, you will learn how to recognize a guest in distress and gain an understanding of what a
guest experiences when actively drowning.
Recognizing A Guest In Distress
A guest in distress is someone who needs immediate assistance. The guest will either be actively drowning or
passively drowning, and located in one of these areas:
• On the surface
• Below the surface, within arm’s reach
• Below the surface, beyond arm’s reach
Characteristics of Active (Responsive) Guests in Distress
Most responsive distressed guests exhibit similar behaviors and characteristics when struggling in the water. You
should be aware of the body position, movement, facial expression, and breathing effort of guests in distress. The
body position is typically vertical in the water with arms extended as if reaching for something to grab onto for
support. There is minimal leg movement or kicking and little or no forward progress being made. These guests
have a look of panic or fear on their
faces. Their eyes may be closed or
wide open, as if they are surprised
to find themselves struggling in the
water. Their heads may be tilted
back to keep water out of their
mouths. They rarely call out for
help because all their efforts are
focused on keeping their mouths
above the surface in order to
breathe (Figure 7.1).

Active (Responsive) Drowning Characteristics
Body Positioning & Movement
• Body is in a vertical position
• Arms are extended as if they are reaching to grab something
• Little to no leg movement or kicking
• Little to no forward movement
Facial Appearance & Breathing
• Facial expression of fear/panic
• Eyes may be open or closed
• Head tilted back to keep the mouth above the water surface to breathe
Characteristics of Passive (Unresponsive) Guests in Distress
There are times when conditions may impact your ability to
immediately recognize a guest in distress. Conditions that might
make it difficult for you to clearly see objects below the surface
include an overly crowded pool, water turbidity (cloudiness),
and glare from the sun. A submerged guest may look like a
blurred spot or an object, such as piece of clothing. Passive
guests are those who have lost consciousness. They may be
seen bobbing or floating at the surface or submerged. If you
notice something below the water surface and cannot quickly
identify it, activate your Emergency Action Plan (EAP), and enter
the water to determine what it is (Figure 7.2).

submerged.
Everyone who visits an aquatic facility is at risk. But looking at
statistics helps us understand who the higher risk guests are, pool locations where a higher number of rescues
are made, and time of day and holidays when a greater frequency of water rescues occur. See Table 7.1 for
more detail.

The Drowning Process
Your ability to recognize a guest in distress and quickly respond can be the difference between life and death
for the guest. Understanding the drowning process can enable you to better appreciate the critical importance
of the 10/20 Protection Standard.
At any moment, a typical guest can be seen enjoying the water. Suddenly something unexpected occurs
putting the guest in distress. This is the moment the drowning process begins. This unexpected “surprise”
results in panic in the water. The guest struggles to keep his or her mouth above the water surface in order to
breathe. During this struggle, water can enter the airway and cause the larynx to spasm (laryngospasm). This
spasm is a protective mechanism to keep water out of the airway. Unfortunately, it keeps oxygen out as well.
This “breath-holding” will eventually cause the guest to lose consciousness. With loss of consciousness, the
guest will go limp in the water and may submerge. As the larynx spasm relaxes, involuntary breaths can occur
causing more water to enter the lungs. Now the guest is in respiratory arrest. Without oxygen, the guest’s
heart cannot continue to function, and cardiac arrest will occur. As time passes, the process of biological death
begins resulting in organ failure and brain death. The longer the guest remains in this state, the lower the
chance of effectively resuscitating the guest. See Table 7.2 for more information.
The time span for the drowning process to occur varies from seconds to minutes. Children may move through
the drowning process quicker than adults. A child may appear to be bobbing in the water but is in distress. If
you observe a child showing the slightest indication of distress, you need to respond immediately.

factant resulting in froth/foam
in the guest's mouth.
Cardiac arrest will ultimately result if respiratory arrest is not corrected.
Rescued before cardiac arrest occurs, and provided with rescue
breathing and supplemental oxygen, cardiac arrest may be avoided.

Cardiac Arrest & Death

As time passes during cardiac arrest irreversible damage can occur to
organs, especially the brain.

Care during this stage requires quality CPR, an AED, supplemental
oxygen support, and suction. The chance of full recovery at this stage
is significantly less than interventions provided in earlier stages.

--- Page 75 Text ---
Surveillance 63
Drownings (active or passive) can be caused by various medical conditions or special situations including heart
attack, seizure, stroke, diabetic emergencies, head injury, shallow water blackout or substance abuse.
Guests that suffer a drowning incident need advanced life support from Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
personnel as quickly as possible. Be sure that 9-1-1 has been called and begin basic life support (CPR/AED/
supplemental oxygen) until paramedics and the emergency medical technicians (EMT) arrive and take over
care. Unfortunately, a guest who suffers from a drowning incident may die even when the best emergency
care is provided. This is why the 10/20 Protection Standard is so critical. You must always remain vigilant and
respond immediately when you see a guest in distress before that guest becomes a victim of drowning.
Proactive Scanning Strategies
Understanding your zone and being able to recognize a guest in distress is critical for lifeguard surveillance.
Knowing what to look for and where to look is key to effectively scanning your Zone of Protection.
Scanning is proactively searching your entire assigned zone every 10 seconds for guests in distress, looking at
all depths of the water including the bottom, middle and surface area.
When scanning, you are searching the extreme areas of your zone and everything in between. When you
are proactively scanning, you are actively searching the water, often physically moving to see everything,
and adjusting your body posture to search through all depths of water in the zone. If you are working in an
elevated location, you may need to physically adjust your body position and head/eye movements so that
you can clearly see along the walls and edges in your zone. You must repeat this type of active observation
continuously to ensure that you are maintaining the 10/20 Protection Standard until you are rotated to
another location (Table 7.3).
Table 7.3 Proactive Scanning
Proactive scanning is: Proactive scanning is NOT:
• Concentrating on your zone • Taking your eyes off your zone
• Observing guests • Allowing social distractions while on stand
• Searching all depths of water • Having extended conversations that interfere
• Searching the extreme areas with your ability to maintain the 10/20 Protection
• Physically moving to see all activity in your zone Standard
• Using a searching pattern(s) • Sitting back in a chair without viewing the area
• Facing your zone with your body when roving beneath your feet
• Actively using strategies to minimize distractions • Remaining stationary when your zone requires
you to rove

--- Page 76 Text ---
Surveillance 64
Proactive Scanning
There are numerous scanning patterns that can
help you maintain the 10/20 Protection Standard.
The most common involve sweeping movements
forward, backward, and sideways (Figure 7.3).
It’s up to you to determine which scanning patterns
work best for you. Some lifeguards scan the water
from the bottom to the surface or vice versa.
Whichever technique you use, you need to be able
to see all depths and all areas in your assigned zone.
Although there may be many types of activities,

FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
Your primary duty as a lifeguard is to maintain the 10/20 Protection Standard which holds you accountable for
the safety of guests in your zone. To do this adequately, you must be vigilant and at a “test-ready” skill level to
respond at all times.
Active guests in distress are normally vertical in the water, with head tilted back on the surface to keep water
from entering the mouth. Guests will have a look of “surprise” or fear on their face and will begin to panic.
There will be little or no forward progress as leg and arm motion is erratic and ineffective.
The drowning process is a sequence of events that includes surprise, respiratory arrest, unconsciousness,
convulsions, cardiac arrest, and death. If rescued promptly, the guest in distress will not progress through
these stages. As time passes and the guest becomes submerged, the body is deprived of oxygen long enough
to result in cardiac arrest, organ failure, and eventually brain death.
Scanning is proactively searching your entire assigned zone every 10 seconds for guests in distress, looking at
all depths of the water including the bottom, middle and surface area.
Scanning is the visual technique for observing guests. While scanning, you should actively search your
zone observing guest behaviors to recognize when a guest is in distress and in need of help. When you
are proactively scanning, you are looking everywhere in your zone, actively moving to see everything, and
adjusting your body posture when necessary to see your area.
There are different scanning strategies and patterns available to use that will enable you to cover your entire
zone effectively. Choose the method that works best for you.

Maintaining Vigilance 68
Vigilance
Vigilance is being alert, attentive and always prepared to react while on watch. Vigilance is a proactive
strategy applied to protect guests. Your duty as a lifeguard requires you to be vigilant so that you are ready
to address potential problems before they escalate. Vigilance is critical when applying the 10/20 Protection
Standard while on duty, including during lifeguard station rotations.
Lifeguard Station Rotations
Some lifeguard duty positions are in elevated
stands while others are walking (roving) positions
Lifeguards rotate stations throughout the day.
A lifeguard station rotation occurs when one
lifeguard assumes the responsibilities from
another lifeguard. During your shift, you may be
asked to work at several different duty stations.
Your supervisor will determine a rotation schedule
that meets the needs of your facility. Rotation
frequency will depend on how many attractions
are open, the number of lifeguards on duty, and
the number of 10/20 and non 10/20 duty stations.
Moving from one duty station to another may
seem simple, but it is a period of increased risk Figure 8.1 Your supervisor will establish the daily rotation
for guests due to its potential impact on lifeguard schedule for all lifeguards
vigilance (Figure 8.1).
Moving you from one location to another frequently
provides a needed break from constant scanning.
When rotating lifeguard stations, you will:
• Ensure that the 10/20 Protection Standard is always maintained
• Avoid distractions that may prevent you from recognizing a guest in distress
• Be ready to react to any guest situation
• Perform a proactive bottom scan of your zone
Proactive Bottom Scan
A Proactive Bottom Scan is conducted prior to accepting and also when exiting zone of protection responsibilities.
This scan is a careful check of the bottom of the zone that is already being protected by another lifeguard. You will
need to check all areas of your zone including the top, middle and bottom of the water, corners, zone edges and
around objects and features. You are confirming that the zone is free of any guests in distress before you assume
responsibility for the zone and the current lifeguard leaves the position. Whenever you are preparing to rotate

--- Page 81 Text ---
Maintaining Vigilance 69
out of the zone, you will repeat the scan verifying that
the bottom is clear before transferring the zone to
the incoming lifeguard. When performing a Proactive
Bottom Scan, you will communicate using verbal and
hand signals to the lifeguard you are rotating with
acknowledging that the zone is clear (Figure 8.2).
Guest Safety During Station
Rotations
It is important that the 10/20 Protection Standard
is maintained during lifeguard station rotations. Figure 8.2 Lifeguards complete a proactive bottom scan and
Follow these steps during rotations: communicate with each other as part of duty station rotations.
1. The incoming lifeguard conducts a Proactive Bottom Scan confirming the zone is clear of any guests in
distress and communicates this information to the on-duty lifeguard
2. Equipment, such as the rescue tube, is exchanged (if necessary)
3. The incoming lifeguard assumes the on-duty position and both lifeguards watch the zone
4. The outgoing lifeguard conducts a Proactive Bottom Scan and communicates “all is okay”” before leaving
5. The new on-duty lifeguard is in control of the lifeguard station until the next lifeguard rotation
See Table 8.1 for more detailed information on lifeguard station rotations
Keep Your Rotation Safe
Always maintain the 10/20 Protection Standard while rotating
When rotating in and rotating out, you must complete a Proactive Bottom Scan
Keep communication to a minimum
Face the zone when communicating during rotation
If exchanging equipment, do so in a safe way that will not compromise your 10/20 Protection Standard

Be aware of several challenges that can prevent you from being able to maintain optimal vigilance. These include:
• Monotony
• Environmental conditions
• Glare on the water
• Attraction features
• Facility attendance extremes
• Facility programming
• Water turbidity
There are several practices you can use to overcome
challenges and remain vigilant:
• The five minute scanning strategy® – The five-
minute strategy involves changing your posture
every five (5) minutes to stay alert. You might
move from a sitting position to a standing or
Figure 8.3 Changing positions frequently helps you to
roving position (Figure 8.3).
stay alert.
• Station Rotations – Rotations necessary to provide lifeguards with a break from constant scanning
• Rotational task balance – Rotational task balance involves alternating your primary duty to watch your
zone with other activities such as cleaning, slide dispatch, life jacket distribution, customer service,
and breaks. Moving in and out of your primary duty that requires you to maintain the 10/20 Protection
Standard can help keep you more alert.
• Strategic breaks –Breaks help keep you refreshed. There are certain points during your shift when a break will
have the most positive impact on your ability to stay alert. Your supervisor will schedule your breaks accordingly.
• Personal self-care – Getting adequate sleep, eating healthy, staying hydrated, exercising regularly, and
wearing the proper clothing for the environment can help you stay alert at work.
Table 8.2 summarizes some of the challenges you will face when trying to remain vigilant and how to apply
practices that can help you to remain alert.

Maintaining Vigilance 73
Avoiding Distractions
Social and technology distractions can greatly impair your ability to remain vigilant. Good lifeguards tend to be
outgoing, friendly people and you are there to help others have a great time. While friendliness is encouraged,
you need to remember that social interactions cannot interfere with your primary task to protect guests.
Social Distractions
There are days when friends or family may visit your facility and want to carry on a conversation with you. Let
them know that when you are on duty, you must remain vigilant. Your eyes must remain on the water as you
constantly scan. Tell them when you will be on break, when your shift ends, or other times when you will be
available to talk.
Sometimes interactions with guests are unavoidable and necessary due to questions about rule enforcement or
your facility’s policies. As with other situations, you need to respond to guests without compromising the 10/20
Protection Standard. If a guest requires so much attention that it could prevent you from remaining vigilant, alert
a supervisor to assist the guest. If a supervisor is unavailable, request the assistance of another lifeguard to either
cover your zone or to assist the guest. If you need to speak with a supervisor or another staff member while at
your station, keep the conversation brief and continue scanning your zone.
Technology Distractions
Although technology is extremely helpful in organizing
our lives, it can become a distraction when you are
on duty. Electronic devices such as two-way radios,
smart phones, watches, and other gadgets can cause
your attention to be diverted away from your zone.
While having immediate access to such devices may be
necessary at your duty station, you should use these
as your local protocols dictate, such as emergency
situations (Figure 8.4).
Non-work-related electronics should not be used
while on duty. These items need to be stored in
appropriate locations, away from lifeguard duty
stations. Phones should not be held in your hands or Figure 8.4 Use communication devices according to your
kept in your pocket while on stand, since they can be operational protocols.
a distraction and could impact your rescue readiness.
Wearable devices, if allowed by your facility, should
only be used for quick glances to confirm the time.

--- Page 86 Text ---
Maintaining Vigilance 74
Secondary Duties
In addition to your primary duty of guest safety, you
will also have secondary duties. These secondary
duties must not take away from your primary
responsibility. Examples of secondary duties include
(Figure 8.5):
• Teaching a swim lesson
• Coaching a swim team
• Leading a special event, such as a birthday party
• Taking attendance
• Retrieving or putting away equipment
Figure 8.5 Secondary duties should never impact your
• Adjusting or moving lane lines
primary duty of maintaining the 10/20 Protection Standard.
• Checking pool chemistry
• Documenting facility records, logs and reports
• Completing opening or closing attraction inspections
• Conducting a water fitness class
• Cleaning the facility
• Working in admissions and cash handling
• Passing out tubes or rafts for an attraction
• Assisting guests with lifejackets
These secondary duties should not be done while you are at a duty station protecting your zone. Anything that
distracts you from scanning your zone in a manner consistent with the 10/20 Protection standard should be
avoided. If you find yourself distracted from your primary job, you can transfer your primary task to another
lifeguard, or you can clear the pool of all guests. None of your secondary duties are considered an emergency.
But recognizing and responding to a guest in distress is!
Improving Performance
This course is just the beginning of your lifeguard training. Once you complete this course and are hired, your
facility supervisor will typically continue your training with additional learning drills. These drills are designed to
keep you alert, increase your ability to recognize guests in distress, and further your training to help you respond
in a timely manner. This on-going training is designed to make sure you are accountable and at a test-ready level
well beyond your initial training class and throughout your entire lifeguard career.
Vigilance Awareness Training® (VAT)®
Vigilance Awareness Training® (VAT)® was designed by Ellis & Associates (E&A) to evaluate the ability of
lifeguards to recognize and respond to a guest in distress. Your facility will conduct VAT® drills which simulate
real emergencies to evaluate your ability to to evaluate your awareness relative to your assigned zone. Drills use
objects like submersible manikins, silhouette dolls, or live persons to test your ability to recognize a problem in
your zone and respond accordingly. This is all part of your professional accountability. These drills reinforce the
most important skills you need to effectively perform your job (Figure 8.6).

FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
Lifeguard vigilance is a proactive strategy used to protect guests. It requires you to stay alert, be prepared to act,
and be focused on preventing problems before they escalate.
A lifeguard rotation describes the process in which lifeguards move from one duty station to another throughout
their shifts. This process involves lifeguards transferring surveillance accountability from the on-duty lifeguard to
the incoming lifeguard who will take over zone surveillance. When rotating, you must always maintain the 10/20
Protection Standard. You will perform a Proactive Bottom Scan of the zone before you start and end a rotation. You
will also avoid distractions that might prevent you from recognizing a guest in distress. Depending on your facility,
you may exchange equipment during the rotation, or you may rotate with equipment.
When you perform a Proactive Bottom Scan, check all depths of the water in your zone including top, middle and
bottom, scan along the edges and corners of the zone, and look around any guests, objects and features that
might block your view. Your objective is to confirm that the bottom is clear.
Due to the nature of the job and working conditions, there can be challenges that impede your ability to maintain
optimal vigilance. These challenges include fatigue, monotony, environment, glare, attraction features, guest
crowding, activity programming, and water turbidity (cloudiness). You can overcome these challenges by using
practices that include the 5-minute strategy, rotating duty stations, having rotational task balance, taking scheduled
breaks, and taking good personal care to prepare yourself for the working conditions.
Social and technology distractions can greatly impair your ability to remain vigilant. Keep conversations with
staff and guests to a minimum and always maintain the 10/20 Protection Standard while on duty. Technology
should only be used when necessary for communication. Personal devices should not be on a duty stand as they
may distract you from your primary duty. Other duties are designed to be secondary and must not interfere with
your primary duty which is to remain vigilant and protect guests.
Your facility will provide ongoing training called Vigilance Awareness Training® (VAT®) which utilizes live drills and
manikin drops to simulate real emergencies that test your performance and ensure you are being accountable
to the 10/20 Protection Standard.

Emergency Action Plan 78
Emergency Action Plans
Every facility has written procedures to practice and
follow when there is an emergency. The procedures
are specific to that facility and are part of their
Emergency Action Plan, commonly called an EAP.
There are different plans for different types of
emergencies. As a lifeguard, you are often a primary
responder in an emergency (Figure 9.1).
The EAP outlines a course of action that will help
you, your supervisors, and other staff to work as
a cohesive team to manage different emergency
situations in the best way possible. You will work to
achieve a successful outcome by:
• Rapidly recognizing a guest in distress Figure 9.1 Lifeguards are often the primary providers
• Promptly providing a rescue and in-water care initiating the EAP.
• Moving a guest (extricating) from an area of
danger when necessary
• Providing effective care on land while awaiting the arrival of Emergency Medical Services (EMS) personnel
after being summoned
During your pre-service and on-going training, you will review and practice your EAP. Anyone involved in the
EAP process should be a part of the periodic practice. Supervisors may encourage you to provide feedback on
the plan during your practice so that your entire emergency response team is confident and competent. If you
are working a single rescuer facility, supplemental responders should participate in reviewing and practicing the
EAP with the lifeguard staff they support. Each facility’s EAP is unique; however, there are common pieces of
information that may be included in your EAP:
• Type of emergency
• Emergency Medical Services (EMS)
• Responding team leader (person ultimately in
charge)
• Expected actions by personnel responding
(supervisors, lifeguards, other staff)
• Location of equipment and description of how it
will be brought to the scene
• Means for maintaining safety and control of
remaining guests
• Transfer of care to EMS personnel
• Local authorities notified including public health
department
Figure 9.2 Communication is critical in any emergency.
• Reporting including incident report, rescue report,
medical services form
• Witness statements
• Media crisis plan including media designated location, facility spokesperson and statement
• Debriefing and counseling services

--- Page 91 Text ---
Emergency Action Plan 79
The steps in an EAP are dependent on the specifics of the facility and the number of team members available.
Every facility operates differently. If you are the responding lifeguard, your initial communication of a problem
notifies others who put the steps of the EAP into motion. Failing to activate and follow the facility EAP in a
prompt manner may jeopardize the guest’s outcome (Figure 9.2).
Multiple Rescuer Facilities
Each person on the team needs to know their role in daily operations and in emergencies. Some facility
emergency response teams include supervisors, support staff, and onsite EMS providers. Larger facilities might
consist of lifeguard teams where everyone is trained as a lifeguard. Smaller facilities may have only one lifeguard
with additional staff trained as “supplemental responders.” Whatever their designation, all responders should
know their roles in every situation.
When your EAP is activated, working as a team will
provide the most effective response in emergency
situations. For example, a team would be able to
simultaneously dedicate staff to airway management,
supplemental oxygen administration, CPR, and AED
use. Each person on the team has a specific duty during
an emergency. Duties vary based on whether you
are the primary responder or secondary responder.
Communication is the key to successful teamwork.
When all responders know all the roles, they can
effectively communicate and fill the care gaps (Figure
9.3).
Figure 9.3 In multiple rescuer facilities the lifeguards work
together to respond to an emergency.
Single Rescuer Facilities
You might work in a facility that only has one lifeguard. Often single rescuer facilities are smaller pools where
the entire zone can be seen by one lifeguard. When working at a single rescuer facility, you are the only
lifeguard on deck at any time, responsible for recognizing and responding to any guest in distress. If there is
a guest who needs assistance, you will render care. If you need assistance, request help from supplemental
responders who are trained to do so.
Supplemental Responders
Supplemental responders are non-lifeguard team members trained to assist lifeguards in emergency
response. For example, in cases of an unresponsive guest or a guest with a suspected spinal injury, two trained
individuals are needed to secure the guest to a backboard and remove the guest from the water. As a lifeguard,
you will be looked upon as the lead responder. It is recommended that you practice working with your facility
supplemental responders so that you are comfortable as the lead responder.

Emergency Action Plan 80
Communication Devices
And Standards
Communication is important when working as a
lifeguard. The first step in every EAP is to communicate
an emergency is occurring. Your whistle codes, hand
signals or radio calls activate the EAP. (Figure 9.4). Your
facility will have a communication process in place
that allows you to activate your EAP and quickly share
pertinent information.
Facilities often tailor their communication program
to fit its needs and environment. Knowing your
communication program will help you:
• Contact EMS
• Effectively communicate with others while on duty
Figure 9.4 Whistle codes, hand signals, and
• Understand what is expected of you by others
communication devices are used by lifeguards.
• Receive assistance from other lifeguards and non-
lifeguard staff
Lifeguards use different devices to communicate throughout their duty shift. The most common devices used
in aquatic facilities include:
• Whistles
• Two-way radios
• Flags
• Hand signals
• Telephones
• Megaphones
• Public address systems
• Automated audio repeater systems
Communication Methods
Communication codes and signals are two methods used for communicating when working at an aquatic
facility. Codes and signals are designed to relay messages quickly, minimizing the need for discussion. Most
lifeguards communicate using whistle codes and hand signals, but different facilities may opt to use additional
or other devices (Table 9.1).

Whistle Codes
Your whistle is the most frequently used device you will use to communicate. As a lifeguard, you will have a
whistle at all times when on duty. The sound of your whistle needs to be recognized over your facility crowd
noise and other facility distractions. When using your whistle, blow it loudly and firmly so that it produces a
shrill sound loud enough to be heard. Common whistle codes involve short blasts and long blasts (Table 9.2).

Hand signals
There are several common hand signals that lifeguards use. When using hand signals, hold the signal until you
are sure it is noticed. Aquatics facilities tend to be noisy environments. Hand signals are often combined with
whistle codes to ensure that the messages are being received. Table 9.3 provides examples of common hand
signals used by lifeguards.
Table 9.3 Common Hand Signals
Hand Signal Message Meaning
Pointing Identify a location or person, provide direction
Raised clinched fist Assistance needed from another lifeguard or a supervisor
Crossed arms above head Stop dispatch. Used to stop sending guests into an area or down a water
slide or an attraction
Thumbs up All clear. It’s safe to continue normal activity. Used to signal the bottom is
clear during the Proactive Bottom Scan
Tapping of top of your head Watch my zone. Indicates you are asking another lifeguard to watch your
area.
Radio Codes
Just like personnel working in Emergency Medical Services
(EMS), police, and fire departments, lifeguards may use
radio codes to deliver messages. Radio codes are used
to transmit information so that only persons working
in your facility can understand what is being discussed.
Radio codes are often site-specific and are understood by
lifeguards and other staff in the facility. Special terms or
phrases may be used during an emergency to distribute
Figure 9.5 You may use two-way radios to communicate
information quickly, make a request, or issue commands
while working and to activate your EAP
that will trigger a specific response (Figure 9.5).

Emergency Action Plan 84
A Case Study in Effective Communication
12:45pm
A female lifeguard working at a wave pool blows a long whistle blast and enters the water to rescue a
submerged guest. Upon making the rescue, she raises a fist to signal that assistance is needed for an
unresponsive guest. A second lifeguard has been covering her zone while the rescue is in progress. He
sees her hand signal and understands her need. He blows two long whistle blasts to notify others of a
major incident and alert them that help is needed.
12:46pm
The supervisor hears the whistle code and responds. He uses a two-way radio to notify the facility
dispatch that there is an emergency in the pool requiring 9-1-1. Other lifeguards are notified of the
incident and location and respond to an “unresponsive guest emergency at the wave pool” with
appropriate equipment.
12:47pm
With the assistance of the lifeguard team, the guest is extricated from the water and more effective care
is provided on deck. The call to 9-1-1 has been placed and the public safety dispatcher has dispatched a
paramedic unit. Care continues until the unresponsive guest is transferred to higher trained health care
providers upon their arrival.
Facility Signs
Most facilities have signs that communicate
information and rules to guests. Signs can be in digital,
illustrated or print format. Signs are typically posted
at the entrance of the facility and near the attractions
entrance. You should become familiar with content on
these signs. Different types of facility signs may include
(Figure 9.6):
• Safety information including water temperature,
chemistry, weather
• Facility rules, policies and operating hours
• Lifejacket information
• Attraction restrictions including height, weight,
swimming requirements Figure 9.6 Your facility signs provide key information to guests.
• Guest education such as safe swimming
guidelines, lifeguard training notifications

Contacting EMS
Every facility will have a way to contact outside EMS
assistance in the event of an emergency. It is a part
of your EAP. As a lifeguard in your facility, you need
to know how and when to contact EMS. Contacting
EMS is normally done by calling 9-1-1 in the US,
Canada, and Mexico. Other countries use a different
emergency number. You might use a standard
telephone or facility phone designated only for
emergencies (Figure 9.7). You might also contact EMS
by activating an alarm that notifies other staff who
will place the call.
Once you reach an emergency dispatcher, clearly
Figure 9.7 You must know how to quickly access EMS as
communicate all pertinent information. The dispatcher
part of your EAP.
will ask you questions such as:
• Your name
• Name of the facility
• The facility address
• Where the guest is located within the facility
• Information on the emergency:
o What happened
o When it happened
o The guest’s condition
o The care that is being provided
Do not hang up until the dispatcher tells you it is okay to hang up. The dispatcher can provide additional
instructions for care if needed.
Other emergency related telephone numbers that you should know and keep posted near a phone are:
• Non-emergency local police department
• Poison control (in the United States, 800-222-1222; for international numbers, visit
http://apps.who.int/poisoncentres/)

Emergency Action Plan 86
FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
Emergency Action Plans (EAPs) are facility specific response steps you and other staff take if there is an emergency.
Lifeguards initiate the EAP when they begin a rescue by using a whistle code, hand signal or activating 9-1-1.
Lifeguards must know their role and the role of other trained responders on the team during emergencies.
Working as a cohesive team is the most efficient and effective way to respond.
Single rescuer facilities are locations where there is only one lifeguard needed to cover the entire facility.
Single rescuer facilities often train other key designated personnel to be supplemental responders to support
the lifeguard in emergency response.
Multiple rescuer facilities are often larger facilities that have multiple zones that must be protected. These
larger facilities might consist of lifeguard teams where everyone is a trained lifeguard.
There are common whistle codes and hand signals used by lifeguards to communicate emergency related
messages. Lifeguards often use a combination of whistle codes and hand signals when they need assistance.
One or two long whistle blasts indicates there is an aquatic emergency.
When you need assistance, you can use the raised clenched fist hand signal to summon another trained
lifeguard or supervisor.
Other communication devices used to distribute messages and information during emergencies and during
normal daily operation include two-way radios, telephones, public address systems, megaphones, automated
announcement systems, and facility signage.
When contacting EMS, you must provide important details related to the emergency such as who, what,
where, when and how the emergency occurred so that responding EMS personnel team are prepared. You
should not hang up the phone until the dispatcher you are speaking with hangs up first.

Basic Life Support: Respiratory Emergencies 88
The Respiratory System
The respiratory system is responsible for delivering oxygen to the lungs during inhalation and removing waste
products, such as carbon dioxide, during exhalation. This process is necessary to sustain life. Any interruption in this
process caused by conditions such as choking, suffocation, or drowning, can result in death within minutes.
During inhalation, air is drawn into the body as the
muscles in the chest wall and the diaphragm contract.
Air enters the mouth and nose, where it is filtered,
warmed, and humidified. The air passes down
the pharynx (throat), and past the epiglottis. The
epiglottis is a thin flap of tissue that allows air to enter
the lungs, while diverting food and fluid down the
esophagus to the stomach. Once past the epiglottis,
air enters the trachea (windpipe). The trachea divides
into two main branches known as bronchi, which
allow air to enter both lungs. The bronchi divide into
smaller tubes known as bronchioles. At the end of Figure 10.1 Oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange in the
the bronchioles, air enters small air sacs known as alveoli.
the alveoli which are in tiny blood vessels known as
capillaries. It is here that oxygen and carbon dioxide
are exchanged. When the muscles of the chest and
the diaphragm relax, air is exhaled (Figure 10.1).
Causes of Respiratory Emergencies
There are numerous causes of respiratory emergencies which can result in respiratory distress or respiratory
arrest. These include:
• Airway obstruction (Choking)
• Inhaling smoke or other toxic substances
• Aspiration (Breathing in stomach contents when vomiting)
• Asthma
• Lung infections such as pneumonia
• Near drowning
• Suffocation
• Chest trauma
• Opioid (narcotic) overdose
• Electrocution
• Heart attack
• Cardiac arrest

Basic Life Support: Respiratory Emergencies 89
Respiratory Distress
Breathing problems are easy to identify. Watch and
listen to how a guest breathes. Ask a conscious
guest how he or she feels when breathing. Signs and
symptoms of respiratory distress include (Figure 10.2):
• Labored breathing (Straining to breathe)
• Noisy breathing (Wheezing, gurgling or high-
pitched sounds)
• Unusually slow or fast breathing
• Unusually deep or shallow breathing
• Irregular breathing
• Gasping for breath
• Inability to speak in full sentences Figure 10.2 A guest in respiratory distress needs
• Restlessness, anxiety, and confusion professional medical help.
• Changes in level of consciousness
• Flushed, pale, or bluish (cyanotic) skin
• Chest pain or discomfort
• Tingling sensations
To care for a guest experiencing respiratory distress:
• Help the guest rest in a position that makes breathing easier. This is often a seated position
• Comfort and reassure the guest
• Call 9-1-1
• Assist the guest with his or her prescribed medications, such as an inhaler
• Administer emergency supplemental oxygen if available
• Keep the guest’s airway clear
Respiratory Arrest
When a guest is no longer breathing, it is a condition known as respiratory arrest. Respiratory arrest can result
from prolonged respiratory distress, or as a result of cardiac arrest. Respiratory arrest prevents the delivery of
oxygen to the body, most importantly to the brain, causing loss of consciousness. Respiratory arrest can also exist
when breathing is ineffective, such as agonal breathing. Agonal breathing is characterized by gasping, labored
breathing. This a brainstem reflex that occurs because the heart is no longer circulating oxygen-rich blood. Death
is certain if left untreated, but is potentially reversible if treated early. The immediate care for respiratory arrest
is to provide rescue breathing. Rescue breathing is discussed later in this chapter.

Scene Survey
Before you can assist any guest, you need to survey the scene. A quick size-up of the scene can provide you
with valuable information such as:
• What may have happened
• The general type of problem that resulted such as a sudden illness or an injury
• The number of guests involved
• If the area is safe for you to approach and to provide care. Unsafe areas include situations such as live
electric wires, fire, smoke, toxic chemical exposure, and areas with active assailants
If the scene is unsafe, try to make it safe without endangering your life. Never enter dangerous areas without
the proper professional training and equipment. If it is not possible to make the scene safe, then call 9-1-1 and
keep others from entering dangerous areas.
Primary Check
When the scene is safe, position yourself next to the
guest and perform a primary check. This is a simple,
systematic approach that should take no more than
10 seconds to determine the presence of immediate
threats to life:
• Check a guest for responsiveness (responsive
guests will answer, move, or moan)
• Check to see if the guest is breathing normally
• Check for a pulse
Figure 10.3 Check responsiveness.
Checking Responsiveness, Breathing, and Pulse
If the guest is motionless, begin the primary check by checking responsiveness. Tap the shoulder of the guest
and shout, “Are you OK?” (Figure 10.3). If the guest does not respond, he or she is said to be unresponsive. If
the guest is unresponsive, make sure 9-1-1 has been called.
Next, open the airway and quickly visualize the chest, looking for movement (rising and falling) that would
indicate breathing. At the same time, check the carotid pulse in the neck of an adult or a child (anyone over the
age of one year). To find the carotid pulse, use your index and middle fingers to locate the Adam’s apple. Slide
your fingers toward you, into the groove at the side of the neck. Press down and feel for a pulse for up to 10
seconds (Figure 10.4). For infants, check the brachial pulse in the inside of the upper arm (Figure 10.5).
If the guest is unresponsive, not breathing (or only has occasional agonal gasps), and no pulse, the guest is in
cardiac arrest and needs cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This is covered in the next chapter. If the guest
is unresponsive, not breathing (or only has occasional gasps), but has a pulse, the guest is in respiratory arrest
and needs rescue breathing.

adult or child.
Secondary Check
If you do not find any life-threatening conditions during the primary check, you should perform a secondary
check. This includes trying to gather any medical history. If the guest is responsive ask if the guest has had any
previous medical problems or is currently taking any medications for the condition. Perform a quick check of
an injured guest from head to toe looking for wounds, deformities, tenderness, or swelling. If the guest is ill
look for signs like hives, rashes, or temperature extremes.
Rescue Breathing
Rescue breathing is the process of manually providing oxygen to the lungs of a guest in respiratory arrest by giving
ventilations using your own breath, or by an artificial means, such as the use of a bag-valve-mask (BVM) (Figure
10.6). Personal protective equipment (PPE) is important when caring for a guest. When using your own breath,
be sure to use a barrier device, such as a resuscitation mask (Figure 10.7). These methods can provide adequate
ventilations while also minimizing the likelihood of disease transmission.

Opening the Airway
To provide rescue breathing, you must first open the
guest’s airway so that the tongue does not restrict the
back of the throat. There are two common maneuvers
used by lifeguards to open the airway:
• Jaw trust with head tilt
• Jaw thrust without head tilt
The jaw thrust with head tilt is commonly used to open
the airway when spinal injury is not suspected. Position
Figure 10.8 Opening the airway using the Jaw Thrust with
yourself at the top of the guest’s head. Place your index

and middle fingers of both hands behind the angle of the
guest’s jaw, and your thumbs on the cheekbones. Lift the
jaw with your fingers and tilt the head back (Figure 10.8).
Adults require more head tilt than children or infants. Do
not hyperextend the neck of a child or infant, as this could
cause narrowing of the trachea.
The jaw thrust without head tilt is the preferred
method used by professionals to open the airway when
a spinal injury is suspected. In this case, it would be
unwise to tilt the head back, as this might cause further
damage to the spine. Position yourself at the top of
the guest’s head. Place your index and middle fingers
Figure 10.9 Opening the airway using the Jaw Thrust
of both hands behind the angle of the guest’s jaw, and
without head tilt.
your thumbs on the cheekbones. Lift the jaw with your
fingers but do not tilt the head back. This will displace
the tongue enough so that rescue breathing will be
successful (Figure 10.9).
Providing Ventilations
With the airway open, provide rescue breathing in a
manner that minimizes the risk of disease transmission.
Health care providers commonly use devices such as
resuscitation masks when responding to emergencies
as a part of their job. These devices involve a facemask
Figure 10.10 Use a resuscitation mask and jaw thrust to
and a one –way valve that attaches to the mask. The

mask must be seated properly on the guest’s face,
while maintaining an open airway. Using one of the jaw thrust techniques, hold the mask securely to the face
with your thumbs. Provide ventilations through the one–way valve (Figure 10.10).

--- Page 105 Text ---
Basic Life Support: Respiratory Emergencies 93
A bag-valve-mask (BVM) is a BVM is a two-rescuer skill
that even experienced providers need to frequently
practice to maintain proficiency. One rescuer holds
the mask securely to the face and maintains an open
airway. The second rescuer squeezes the bag to provide
ventilations. The BVM provides a higher concentration of
oxygen than a resuscitation mask alone. When connected
to an oxygen cylinder, the BVM provides the highest
concentration of oxygen possible during rescue breathing
(Figure 10.11).
When ventilations are provided, they should be given Figure 10.11 Providing ventilations with a bag-valve-mask
gently, over a period of 1 second. Provide 1 ventilation requires two rescuers.
every 5-6 seconds for an adult, or every 3-5 seconds
for a child or infant. Children and infants do not need
the same volume as adults. Each ventilation should be
enough to make the chest rise. Table 10.1 provides an
overview of the steps for rescue breathing.
If the chest does not rise when providing ventilations,
reposition the head and mask and reattempt your
ventilation. If your attempts at delivering ventilations
are unsuccessful, it is likely the guest has an airway
obstruction that needs to be cleared.
Recovery Position
Figure 10.12 The recovery position protects the guest’s
airway.
If a guest is unresponsive but is breathing and has
no other life-threatening conditions, the guest can be
placed in the recovery position. Placing a guest in the
recovery position will ensure that any vomit or fluid
will not cause the guest to choke (Figure 10.12).

Special Situations
Laryngectomy
A guest who has had a laryngectomy has had the larynx
surgically removed. This guest breathes through a
small opening in the front of the neck called a stoma
(Figure 10.13). To provide rescue breathing for a guest
with a laryngectomy, close the guest’s mouth and
nose, place a pediatric sized resuscitation mask over
the stoma, and give ventilations. If a breathing tube

through a stoma.
directly to the tube.
Vomiting
If a guest begins to vomit while you are providing rescue breathing, turn the guest to the side while trying to
maintain the head and body inline. With your gloved hand, wipe the guest’s mouth clean, roll the guest back
and continue rescue breathing.
Dentures
If you are providing rescue breathing for a guest with dentures, it is not necessary to remove them. Dentures will
help maintain a seal on the facemask. However, if the dentures are very loose and may prevent air from entering
freely, then the dentures should be removed.

--- Page 107 Text ---
Basic Life Support: Respiratory Emergencies 95
Air in the Stomach
When providing rescue breathing, it is important to provide proper ventilations to avoid getting air into the
guest’s stomach (gastric distention) which can result in vomiting. Air in the stomach often results from one of
the following errors:
• Not properly opening the airway
• Giving ventilations that are too deep
• Giving ventilations too fast
You can avoid air in the stomach by providing ventilations lasting 1 second, delivered every 5-6 seconds (3-5
seconds for children and infants), and only until the chest rises.
Suspected Spinal Injury
If you are caring for a guest that may have a spinal injury either from an injury in the pool or from some type of blunt
force, you should take steps to avoid moving the victim’s head and neck more than is needed. To open the airway, you
want to modify your approach and use the jaw thrust without head tilt as discussed earlier in this chapter.
Rescue Breathing: What Really Matters?
Ventilations must be provided in a manner that does not over inflate the lungs or end up with air in the
stomach. Breathing too rapidly (hyperventilation) or forcefully can damage the lungs of a young child or
infant. It can also cause distention of the abdomen that can result in vomiting, inability of the lungs to fully
inflate, and a decrease in the amount of blood that returns to the heart.
Airway Obstruction
Airway obstruction, commonly called choking,can occur in a responsive or unresponsive guest.
Airway Obstruction in a
Responsive Adult or Child
Airway obstruction (choking) in a responsive adult most
often results from an object, such as food, becoming
lodged in the throat. Children and infants also choke
on small objects such as coins or toys. A choking guest
may clutch the throat in what is commonly referred to
as the universal distress sign of choking (Figure 10.14).
Figure 10.14 Universal distress sign of choking.

--- Page 108 Text ---
Basic Life Support: Respiratory Emergencies 96
If the guest can cough, the airway is only partially obstructed. Encourage the guest to continue coughing. This
often aids in dislodging the obstruction. If the guest cannot cough, speak, cry, or breathe, or is coughing weakly
or making high pitched “crowing” sounds, the airway is severely obstructed, and immediate care is needed.
If the choking guest is an adult or child, use the Heimlich
Maneuver to dislodge the obstruction. Stand behind
the guest. Reach around the guest’s waist with one
hand and locate the navel. Make a fist with your other
hand and place the fist just above the navel. Grasp
your fist and give inward and upward thrusts to force
the object out (Figure 10.15). Repeat these thrusts
until the object is dislodged or the guest becomes
unresponsive. If the guest becomes unresponsive, you
will need to begin CPR.
If a choking guest is too large and you are unable to Figure 10.15 Provide inward and upward abdominal
reach around the guest to give effective abdominal thrusts to relieve an obstruction in adults and children.
thrusts, or if the guest is obviously pregnant, give chest
thrusts. Reach under the guest’s armpits and place the
thumb side of your fist against the center of the guest’s
chest. Grasp your fist with your other hand and give
quick, inward thrusts (Figure 10.16).

4. With your free hand, place 2 fingers on the
breastbone, about a finger width below the
nipples, and give 5 chest compressions. Each
compression should be at least 1/3 the depth
of the chest (about 1.5 inches) and allow the
chest to fully recoil after each compression

dislodged or the infant becomes unresponsive.
If the infant becomes unresponsive, begin CPR
How the Heimlich Maneuver Works
The diaphragm is the largest muscle aiding breathing. When your hands are positioned just above the
navel, they lie just below the diaphragm. When you pull inward and upward, the diaphragm is moved
upward. This action forces air out of the lungs under pressure, which is often adequate to dislodge an
object in a conscious choking adult or child.
Airway Obstruction (Choking) In an Unresponsive Guest
If your ventilations fail to make the chest rise,
reposition the head and mask, and repeat ventilations.
If still unsuccessful, suspect an airway obstruction.
Provide 30 chest compressions to dislodge the object.
Look in the mouth for any object and sweep the
object out with your finger if you see it (Figure 10.19).
Reattempt ventilations. This is normally all that is
needed to dislodge the object. Repeat this process
until chest rise is obtained.

FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
The respiratory system is responsible for delivering oxygen to the lungs during inhalation and removing waste
products, such as carbon dioxide, during exhalation. This continuous process is necessary to sustain life. Any
interruption in this process from conditions such as choking, suffocation, or drowning, can result in death
within minutes.
There are numerous causes of respiratory emergencies which can result in respiratory distress when a guest’s
breathing is compromised, or respiratory arrest, when a guest is no longer breathing. When a guest is
experiencing respiratory distress, care begins by performing a primary assessment that allows you to survey
the scene, followed by a primary check. The primary check involves checking responsiveness, breathing, and
circulation.
If a guest is unresponsive and not breathing, but has a pulse, the guest needs rescue breathing which is the
process of manually providing oxygen to the lungs of a guest by giving ventilations using your own breath, or
by an artificial means, such as the use of a bag-valve-mask (BVM). If the guest does not have a life-threatening
injury, you should perform a secondary check.
Personal protective equipment (PPE), such as a resuscitation mask, can be used to effectively provide
ventilations. Ventilations should be given at a rate of one every 5-6 seconds for adults, and one every 3-5
seconds for children and infants. Do not breathe too fast or forcefully, as this can result in complications.
If the airway is obstructed in a responsive adult or child, perform the Heimlich Maneuver. For responsive
choking infants, provide back slaps and chest compressions. If ventilations are unsuccessful, suspect an airway
obstruction. Reposition the head and repeat ventilations. If still unsuccessful, provide 30 chest compressions,
check the airway, and reattempt ventilations. Continue these steps until the object is removed or professional
rescuers take over.

Basic Life Support: Cardiac Emergencies 100
The Circulatory System
The circulatory system is made up of the heart and
blood vessels. This system delivers oxygen and
nutrients throughout the body and removes waste
products such as carbon dioxide. The heart is an organ
about the size of a guest’s fist. It has four chambers
through which blood moves in and out. The two upper
chambers are the atria. The two lower chambers are
the ventricles. The two chambers on the right side of
the heart are the right atrium (upper chamber) and
right ventricle (lower chamber). These chambers
Figure 11.1 The circulatory system.
receive oxygen-poor venous blood from the body and
pump it to the lungs, where the waste products are
removed, and oxygen is picked up and returned to the left side of the heart. The two chambers on the left side
of the heart are the left atrium (upper chamber) and left ventricle (lower chamber). These chambers accept the
oxygen-rich blood and pump it out to all parts of the body through the arteries (Figure 11.1).
The heart muscle is unique in that it creates its own electrical impulses automatically. These impulses, normally
originating in the upper right side of the heart, move along an electrical conduction system in a wavelike pattern
throughout the heart. When these impulses reach specialized muscle tissue, the chambers of the heart contract
and then relax. This action moves blood throughout the body and generates a pulse. The electrical impulses in
the heart can be viewed and interpreted through an electrocardiogram (ECG).
Cardiovascular Disease
Cardiovascular disease includes conditions that involve the heart and the blood vessels (arteries, veins, and
capillaries). Coronary heart disease (CHD) involves the narrowing of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels that
supply oxygen and blood to the heart. This is usually caused by atherosclerosis, which is the plaque (cholesterol
substances) that accumulates on the inside walls of the arteries, causing them to narrow. This results in reduced
blood flow to the heart. CHD commonly causes chest discomfort, shortness of breath, heart attack, or sudden
cardiac death, known as cardiac arrest. Diseases of the blood vessels can also affect other organs, such as the
brain, resulting in a stroke. Stroke is covered in detail in a later chapter.
Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease
There are 8 risk factors commonly associated with cardiovascular disease. Five risk factors that can be controlled
are:
• High cholesterol – Total cholesterol level is a measure of all the cholesterol in the blood, including LDL (bad)
cholesterol and HDL (good) cholesterol. The higher the LDL (bad) cholesterol number, the greater the risk
of developing heart disease from cholesterol build up in the arteries
• High blood pressure – Blood pressure (BP) increases with each heartbeat and decreases when the heart
relaxes. Blood pressure constantly changes as a result of exercise, stress, or sleep. For adults at rest, BP for
adults should normally be less than 120/80 mm Hg (120 systolic and 80 diastolic)

--- Page 113 Text ---
Basic Life Support: Cardiac Emergencies 101
• Overweight – Body Mass Index (BMI) is a method used to determine if a guest is overweight. It is calculated
from a guest’s weight and height and provides an indicator of body fatness that can lead to health problems.
Although BMI correlates with the amount of body fat, it does not directly measure body fat. Some people,
such as athletes, may have a BMI that identifies them as being overweight even though they do not have
excess body fat
• Smoking – Smoking is a major cause of heart disease. A guest’s risk of heart disease and heart attack greatly
increases with the number of cigarettes smoked. People who smoke are two to four times more likely to suffer
heart disease. Women who smoke are twice as likely to have a heart attack as male smokers
• Diabete – Adults with diabetes are two to four times more likely to have cardiovascular disease than
adults without diabetes. People with diabetes often have other risk factors that contribute to their risk for
developing cardiovascular disease
Risk factors that cannot be controlled are:
• Gender – Coronary heart disease, the single biggest cause of death in the United States, claims men and
women in nearly equal numbers each year
• Heredity – Certain inherited heart conditions can affect the physical structure of the heart and interfere
with its ability to pump blood to the rest of the body. Hereditary electrical disturbances (dysrhythmias)
can result in a heartbeat that is too fast, too slow or irregular. This can lead to rapid heartbeat, light-
headedness, dizziness, fainting, and sometimes sudden death
• Age – As people age, the risks of cardiovascular disease increase
Cardiac Arrest
If the heart muscle is damaged severely, a guest’s heart can cease to function. The guest will become unresponsive,
non-breathing, and pulseless. This is known as Cardiac Arrest. The immediate care for a guest in cardiac arrest
is to activate EMS, which in most areas of the United States means calling 9-1-1, and provide cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) until a defibrillator is available.
Increasing the Odds of Surviving Cardiac Arrest
The “Chain of Survival” is a concept based on a series of actions that must occur for a guest to have the
best chance to survive cardiac arrest. The strength of the chain is dependent upon all the links:
• Early recognition and access to EMS through an emergency number (e.g. 9-1-1)
• Early CPR by those first on the scene
• Early defibrillation, often using an AED
• Early advanced care by paramedics and hospital professionals
• Effective post resuscitative care

--- Page 114 Text ---
Basic Life Support: Cardiac Emergencies 102
Activating EMS
You play a major role in making the EMS system work effectively. The system is a network of community
resources, including public safety personnel (police, fire, and EMS), lifeguards, and hospital medical personnel.
The system works best when EMS personnel are summoned promptly. The early arrival of more advanced
medical professionals, coupled with your initial care at the scene, provide a guest the best chance of surviving
a life-threatening emergency.
When a 9-1-1 call is placed, an emergency call taker (dispatcher) will request information from you:
• Whether you need police, fire or medical assistance
• Your name
• The phone number from which you are calling
• The location of the emergency and accessibility
• The problem you are experiencing
Answer the questions and do not hang up before the dispatcher indicates you can do so. The dispatcher
is likely trained to provide pre-arrival instructions to assist you with life-saving steps if needed until EMS
personnel arrive and take over.
Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR)
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) involves providing chest compressions and ventilations that help
circulate blood and oxygen to vital organs throughout the body. If you conduct your primary check and confirm
that the guest is unresponsive, not breathing, and pulseless, begin CPR starting with chest compressions. Make
sure your EAP is activated in order to get an Automated External Defibrillator (AED) and Emergency Medical
Services (EMS) professionals called to the scene as soon as possible.
Chest compressions are the most important part of high-quality CPR, and require you to:
• Position the guest on his/her back on a hard surface
• Compress on the center of the chest
• Push fast (at a rate of 100-120 compressions per minute)
• Push deep (at least 2 inches for an adult or child)
• Push rhythmically
• Allow for complete recoil of the chest
• Minimize interruptions
Ventilations are the second part of CPR. Ventilations should be given over 1 second duration and be enough to
make the chest rise.
Continue CPR until a defibrillator is available or the guest shows signs of life such as breathing, coughing,
crying, moaning, moving, and consciousness.

--- Page 115 Text ---
Basic Life Support: Cardiac Emergencies 103
When to Stop CPR
Situations in which you can interrupt CPR include:
• The guest begins showing signs of normal breathing or responsiveness
• You are too exhausted to continue
• You are replaced by another rescuer
• The scene is no longer safe
• Responding EMS assumes responsibility for the guest

7. Repeat cycles of 30 compressions and
2 ventilations until a defibrillator is available or
the infant shows signs of life
Multiple - Rescuer CPR
Health care providers including nurses, physicians,
EMS providers, and lifeguards often respond to cardiac
arrest as part of a team. Two or more rescuers can
Figure 11.7 Ventilations provided to an infant during CPR.
work more efficiently than a single rescuer. Performing
CPR as part of a team enables rescuers to change
positions when one tires during chest compressions.
This should be done about every two minutes to ensure
that compression depth and rate are maintained at an
optimal level.
In multiple-rescuer CPR, one rescuer provides chest
compressions and the second rescuer provides
ventilations. In cases where a bag-valve-mask (BVM)
is used, two rescuers will provide ventilations. When
performing multiple-rescuer CPR on an adult, the
compression to ventilation ratio remains the same as
one-rescuer CPR which is 30:2 (Figure 11.8). When
performing multiple-rescuer CPR on a child or infant,
Figure 11.8 Two-rescuer CPR for an adult.
the compression to ventilation ratio changes to 15:2.
When multiple-rescuers perform CPR on an infant,
the rescuer providing compressions should use two
thumbs to compress the chest, while encircling the
infant’s chest with both hands (Figure 11.9).

Pregnancy and CPR
If a pregnant woman is in cardiac arrest, she needs CPR just
like anyone else. But placing a woman in the later stage of
pregnancy flat on her back can result in the weight of the
fetus compromising blood flow in and out of the heart. You
can correct this by carefully moving the fetus toward the
left side of the abdomen, a technique known as left uterine
displacement (LUD). Hold the fetus in this position while
chest compressions are provided by other responders.
Circulatory Assist Devices
Circulatory assist devices offer alternatives to conventional manual cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). EMS
personnel may use such devices as part of the care they provide upon arrival. These devices use a circumferential
vest or an automatic mechanical piston. These devices are designed to provide continuous maximum compression
and maximum recoil helping improve blood return to the heart while preventing rescuer fatigue (Figure 11.10, 11.11).

Automated External Defibrillation (AED)
The Heart’s Electrical Conduction System
The electrical conduction system of the heart sends the signal that results in the contraction of the
chambers of the heart and the pulse that is felt. The normal electrical impulse in the heart originates in
the sinoatrial (SA) node, found in the upper part of the right atria. This impulse occurs about once every
second and travels along pathways within both atria. The impulse moves downward, passing through the
atrioventricular (AV) node located between the atria and ventricles. Beneath the AV node, the electrical
pathway divides into the right and left bundle branches, extending into the corresponding two ventricles.

--- Page 120 Text ---
Basic Life Support: Cardiac Emergencies 108
When the electrical impulse reaches the purkinje fibers
in the ventricles, the heart muscle contracts, forcing
blood to move throughout the body (Figure 11.12).
When the normal electrical activity of the heart
is interrupted, electrical disturbances known as
dysrhythmias will occur. These dysrhythmias can be
viewed as tracings on an electrocardiogram (ECG). Two
of the most common life-threatening dysrhythmias
seen in the first few minutes of sudden cardiac arrest
are ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) and ventricular
fibrillation (V-fib). Ventricular tachycardia causes the
ventricles to beat far too fast. The chambers cannot
fill properly or pump blood effectively. Ventricular
fibrillation is disorganized, chaotic electrical activity that
results in quivering of the ventricles. Blood cannot be
pumped out of the heart so the guest will be pulseless.
Figure 11.12 The heart’s electrical conduction system.
About AEDs
An Automated External Defibrillator (AED) is a portable electronic device applied to a guest in cardiac arrest.
It can analyze the heart rhythm and deliver an electric shock, known as Defibrillation, to the heart of a guest
to correct ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. The goal of defibrillation is to reestablish a viable
heart rhythm by shutting down the heart (asystole), enabling the heart to restart with normal electrical and
mechanical function. Besides analyzing the heart rhythm and delivering a shock if needed, an AED also records
data such as the number of shocks delivered, changes in the ECG, the date, and the time of use. There are
several different AED manufacturers (Figure 11.13). Beyond the minor differences in device appearance (color,
size, buttons, voice), all AEDs have
the following commonalities:
• Battery operated
• Self - maintained internal diagnostics
• Power on/off
• Voice prompts to guide users
• Cable and electrode pads to attach to the chest
• ECG analysis capability
• Defibrillation capability
Figure 11.13 All AEDs can analyze the heart rhythm,
deliver a shock (defibrillation) if needed, and store data.

"Rebooting" the Heart
To help you better understand how an AED works, think of an AED restarting the heart in the same way
you would reboot a computer when it locks up. You shut it completely down and then restart it. That’s
how an AED works to “reboot” the heart.
Using an AED
The initial care for a guest in cardiac arrest involves
giving CPR until a defibrillator is available. For every
minute that defibrillation is delayed, the chance that a
guest in cardiac arrest will survive decreases 7% - 10%.
Once an AED is available, turn the device on and follow
the prompts. Prepare the guest’s chest. This involves
removing clothing, drying the chest if damp, and shaving
any excessive hair where the electrodes will be placed.
Figure 11.14 If the guest’s chest is wet dry the chest in the
A “Ready Kit” is part of the AED, and normally includes
areas where the electrode pads will be placed.
scissors, razor, and a drying cloth for the purpose of
preparing the guest’s chest (Figure 11.14).
Remove the two electrode pads from the package.
Peel the protective backing off the pads and place
the pads on the chest according to the diagram on
the packaging. For adults, one pad is placed just
below the right collarbone. The other pad is placed
on the lower left side of the chest (Figure 11.15). Pad
placement varies for children and infants. Follow the
manufacturer’s instructions for use of pediatric pads if
you have these available.
Figure 11.15 Electrode pads are placed on a bare, dry chest.
With the cable attached to the AED, the device will
immediately begin analysis of the heart’s electrical
activity once the second electrode pad is attached.
Stand clear and allow the device to analyze the rhythm
(Figure 11.16). The AED will advise when it is necessary
to administer a shock. Some AED’s are fully automated
and will administer the shock automatically. Others
are semi-automatic requiring the operator to push a
flashing “shock” button.
Figure 11.16 Make sure no one is in contact with the guest
once the electrodes are attached.

--- Page 122 Text ---
Basic Life Support: Cardiac Emergencies 110
If advised to shock, make sure no one is in contact
with the guest before the shock is administered
(Figure 11.17). If no shock is advised, it means that
the AED did not find a shockable rhythm (V-fib or
V-tach).
Regardless of whether a “shock” or a “no shock”
advisory is given, follow with 2 minutes of CPR if the
guest is in cardiac arrest. In some cases, more than
one shock will be needed to correct the dysrhythmia.
Two minutes of CPR should be given following every
analysis or shock (Figure 11.18). If the shock is
successful, the guest may begin to show signs of life.
Figure 11.17 Automatic AEDs deliver the shock without
user aid. Semi-automatic devices require the user to press
AED Special Considerations
the shock button.
There are four special considerations to be aware of
when using an AED:
• Medication patches
• Children and infants
• Water
• Implanted devices
Medication patches such as nitroglycerin, pain
medication, or nicotine are worn on the skin and
absorbed into the body. If a patch is worn on the chest
and it is in the way of where an electrode pad will be
placed, remove the patch and wipe the chest. Then
apply the electrode pad. Figure 11.18 Provide 2 minutes of CPR between shocks, or
whenever a shock is not advised.
Primary cardiac arrest in children and infants is
rare. Cardiac arrest in children and infants is usually
secondary to airway and breathing problems that
ultimately lead to cardiac arrest. When using an
AED on a child or infant, it is best to use specialized
pediatric electrode pads or a “key system,” either of
which can reduce the energy being delivered to those
less than 8 years of age. Place the pediatric pads in
accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions. This
may mean placement of one pad on the chest and the
other on the back. If pediatric pads are not available,
adult pads can be used (Figure 11.19).
Water is a conductor of electricity, which could provide

on placement of pediatric electrode pads.
Common practice is to remove the guest from any free-

Basic Life Support: Cardiac Emergencies 111
standing water. This can include moving a guest from
a pool to at least 6 feet away from the pool edge. It
could also include placing the guest on a backboard
to further ensure separation from the water. Dry the
guest’s chest and then attach the electrode pads.
Taking these precautions greatly reduces any risks to
the guest and rescuers.
Implanted devices include internal pacemakers and
cardioverter defibrillators (ICD). These devices are
placed under the skin and attached to the heart in
people with specific heart conditions. They can often
be seen or felt once clothing is removed from the chest.
Figure 11.20 Implanted cardioverter defibrillator.
Implanted devices can be placed on either side of the
chest, so avoid placing electrode pads directly on top of the ICD (Figure 11.20). If the implanted device delivers a
shock to the guest while you are using the AED (e.g. the guest’s muscles contract similar to that observed during
AED use), it will not damage your AED. The AED analysis may be interrupted during this time.
Since an ICD shocks the heart directly, the energy is less powerful than a shock given externally through an AED.
Though the guest will feel a jolt, the energy that escapes to the surface, where a rescuer might be in contact with
the guest, is hard to detect and harmless.
AED Maintenance
AEDs require very little maintenance. Devices run their
own internal checks to verify proper operation. AEDs
have warning lights that signal users that the device is
functioning properly or that it is malfunctioning. If a
device has a problem, such as a low battery, it can inform
users by changing to a red light instead of its normal
light and chirping the same way a smoke alarm does.
This signals those responsible for the maintenance of
the device that attention is needed immediately.
Periodic inspection of the AED will also ensure that the

proper supplies will be available, such as unexpired
that it is functioning and that the necessary supplies are

FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
Cardiovascular disease includes conditions that involve the heart and the blood vessels (arteries, veins, and
capillaries). Coronary heart disease (CHD) involves the narrowing of the coronary arteries, the blood vessels
that supply oxygen and blood to the heart. If the heart muscle is damaged severely, a guest’s heart can cease
to function. This is known as Cardiac Arrest.
Caring for a life-threatening cardiac emergency begins by checking responsiveness, breathing, and circulation.
If a guest is unresponsive, not breathing, and pulseless, the guest needs CPR.
Regardless of whether the guest is an adult, child, or infant, the general steps of CPR are the same. Begin CPR
with chest compressions. Compressions should be deep, fast, and with minimal interruptions. In single-rescuer
CPR, provide 30 chest compressions at a rate of 100 -120 compressions per minute (almost 2 per second) and 2
ventilations. When performing multiple-rescuer CPR on an adult, the compression to ventilation ratio remains
the same as one-rescuer CPR, 30 chest compressions and 2 ventilations.
When performing multiple-rescuer CPR on a child or infant, the compression to ventilation ratio changes to
15 compressions and 2 ventilations. Repeat cycles of compressions and ventilations until a defibrillator is
available, you are too exhausted to continue, the guest shows signs of life, or EMS personnel take over care.
The electrical conduction system of the heart is responsible for coordinating the rhythmic pumping action
of the heart. Ventricular fibrillation (V-fib) and ventricular tachycardia (V-tach) are two of the most common
electrical disturbances present at the time of cardiac arrest. Both rhythms interrupt normal blood flow. Both
respond to defibrillation. The earlier an AED can be used, the greater the chance the guest will survive.
Provide CPR until an AED is available. Once available, turn on the AED and follow the prompts of the device.
An AED will give one of two commands – “Shock” or “No shock advised.” Provide CPR for two minutes after
receiving the command. After two minutes, the AED will advise you to stand clear so that it can reanalyze the
heart and advise you as to how to continue with care. There are only a few special considerations when using
an AED. These include water, medication patches, children and infants, and implanted devices. AEDs require
little maintenance other than to inspect it regularly to verify that the device is functioning properly and has the
necessary supplies to respond to a cardiac emergency.
When dealing with a cardiac emergency, it is important that you remain calm and provide the care you are
being trained to give until EMS arrives.

Supplemental Oxygen System 115
Drowning and the Need for
Supplemental Oxygen
During a drowning incident, oxygen is unable to reach the body’s vital organs, such as the heart, lungs, and brain.
These organs are not able to function without the continuous delivery of oxygen through the bloodstream.
Supplemental oxygen should be provided to any guest experiencing respiratory distress from a drowning
incident.
When providing rescue breaths through a resuscitation
mask, approximately 16% oxygen is exhaled by the
rescuer into the nonbreathing guest. While this is
adequate to support the amount of oxygen needed to
resuscitate the guest, providing a higher concentration
of oxygen can improve oxygenation. With the availability
of inexpensive, easily deployable oxygen systems,
lifeguards can successfully deliver supplemental oxygen
to distressed guests during resuscitation (Figure 12.1).
Figure 12.1 Supplemental oxygen should be used during
resuscitation efforts.
Supplemental
Oxygen Systems (SOS)
A supplemental oxygen system (SOS) can help with
numerous breathing emergencies including drowning.
A complete system is easy to use and meets or exceeds
emergency oxygen requirements (Figure 12.2).
Regulations Governing
Supplemental Oxygen Use
Some states have established regulations for the
purchase and use of supplemental oxygen. The device

you use must be designed specifically for emergency
use. The Food and Drug Administration does not require
a prescription for emergency use oxygen, provided that oxygen systems designed for emergency use contain
at least a 15-minute supply of oxygen and deliver a flow rate of at least 6 liters per minute (lpm). Your facility
management is responsible for making sure that all local, regional, and state regulations governing emergency
oxygen use are followed when providing a supplemental oxygen system, training, and operational protocols.

--- Page 128 Text ---
Supplemental Oxygen System 116
Oxygen Cylinder
Oxygen used during emergency care will be provided
in a seamless steel, aluminum alloy, or kevlar cylinder.
In the United States, oxygen cylinders will be green
or will have a green band around the cylinder and a
yellow diamond indicating “oxidizer.” The product label
will have appropriate warnings concerning the proper
handling of the cylinder (Figure 12.3).
The cylinder is filled to a working pressure of
approximately 2000 pounds per square inch (psi). The Figure 12.3 Oxygen cylinders have distinctive color
size of the cylinder is identified by code letters. The markings and labels.
most common sizes for portable oxygen cylinders are
D and E cylinders, which hold 35-650 liters of oxygen at 2000 psi and 70°F (21°C). The size of the cylinder, the
amount of oxygen in the cylinder, and the rate of oxygen flow from the cylinder will determine how long the
oxygen in the cylinder will last.
Oxygen cylinders have a valve that allows high pressure gas in the cylinder to be delivered by a pressure regulator.
U.S. federal law requires that most common refillable oxygen cylinders be tested every 5 years to ensure safe
use. Oxygen suppliers can provide information on testing and servicing requirements.
Pressure Regulator
Oxygen must be administered at a safe working pressure.
To accomplish this, a pressure regulator is placed on
the cylinder valve post. The pressure regulators used
on portable oxygen cylinders have metal prongs that
engage matching holes on the cylinder valve. The
arrangement of these holes varies for all various types
of gas cylinders. This safety feature ensures that the
correct type of regulator is attached (Figure 12.4).

post valve, hand tighten the regulator in place and
attach the oxygen tubing. Open the cylinder so that
oxygen can flow into the pressure regulator. The cylinder post valve is opened by turning a knob or using a
special key or wrench provided. Newer systems have a built-in mechanism to open the cylinder. Oxygen cylinder
valves also contain safety relief devices (rupture/safety disks) designed to release gas from an over=pressurized
cylinder, which can occur due to excessive heat.

--- Page 129 Text ---
Supplemental Oxygen System 117
The pressure regulator is equipped with a gauge that
indicates how much pressure is in the cylinder. By
checking the gauge, you can estimate the amount of
time supplemental oxygen can be delivered (Figure
12.5). Cylinders should be changed if the gauge shows
less than 15 minutes or 500 psi of oxygen remaining in
the cylinder.
The regulator also has a flowmeter that controls
the amount of oxygen delivered in liters per minute
(lpm). Flowmeters can deliver oxygen at 1-25
lpm. A continuous oxygen flow rate of 15 lpm is

system at your facility may have a preset flowmeter
that allows only a flow rate of 15 lpm.
Changing Oxygen Cylinders
If you need to replace an oxygen cylinder, follow these steps:
1. Close the valve
2. Open the flowmeter to bleed off oxygen remaining under pressure in the regulator (if adjustable)
3. Remove the regulator from the used oxygen cylinder
4. Properly seat the regulator on the new oxygen cylinder and hand-tighten it in place
5. With the flowmeter off, open the valve and read the starting pressure in the cylinder, which should be
approximately 2000 psi
Supplemental Oxygen Delivery Devices
Resuscitation Mask
The recommended style of resuscitation masks used
by lifeguards have a port that allows oxygen to be
attached through tubing connected to the oxygen
flowmeter. This allows rescue breaths to be delivered
with a higher concentration of oxygen (Figure 12.6).
Figure 12.6 A resuscitation mask can be attached to
supplemental oxygen during rescue breathing.

--- Page 130 Text ---
Supplemental Oxygen System 118
Bag-Valve-Mask (BVM)
A bag-valve-mask (BVM) is a device used to provide
breaths to a nonbreathing guest by attaching a
resuscitation mask to one end of a self-refilling bag
and the other end of the bag to the SOS. When the
bag is squeezed, air passes through a one-way valve
attached to a mask positioned on the guest’s face
(Figure 12.7).
The BVM has advantages over a resuscitation mask.
The BVM delivers oxygen without requiring you Figure 12.7 A bag-valve-mask attached to supplemental

provide a higher oxygen concentration (21%) when
not attached to the SOS, and a much higher oxygen
concentration (90%) when attached to the SOS.
BVMs should include the following features:
• Self-refilling bag
• Non-jam valve system allowing a minimum oxygen inlet flow of 15 lpm
• Standard 15-mm/22-mm fittings
• Reservoir system attached to the bag for delivering the highest concentration of oxygen
• Non-rebreathing valve
• Ability to perform under various environmental conditions
• Various sizes for use with infants, children, and adults
Store the BVM so that it is readily available with the SOS system to reduce the length of time that it takes to set
up for use. Until the BVM is ready for use, provide rescue breaths with a resuscitation mask. Once the BVM is
attached to the SOS, set the flow of oxygen at 15 lpm and allow the reservoir bag to fill completely.
Two lifeguards will be needed to use a BVM to provide
ventilations during rescue breathing or CPR. One
lifeguard will kneel above the guest’s head, open
the airway, and hold the mask on the face. A second
lifeguard is positioned at the guest’s side, near the
head, and is responsible for squeezing the bag (Figure
12.8). Adult, child, and infant-sized masks and bags
are available for use. Regardless of the size of the bag
used, squeeze the bag only enough to provide chest
rise. During CPR, a third lifeguard will provide chest
compressions (Figure 12.9).
Figure 12.8 Two lifeguards are needed to properly use a
BVM.

--- Page 131 Text ---
Supplemental Oxygen System 119
If you are using the BVM and the guest’s chest does
not rise when you squeeze the bag, the problem
could be with the BVM or with your use of the BVM.
Problems can be caused by failure to:
• Maintain a good mask seal
• Maintain an open airway
• Squeeze the bag to generate the necessary
volume of air
• Remove a foreign body airway obstruction
If you believe the problem is with the BVM, switch to
a resuscitation mask attached to oxygen until another Figure 12.9 When using a BVM during CPR, three
BVM is available. lifeguards are needed.
Non-rebreathing Mask
A non-rebreathing mask allows oxygen to be
administered to a guest who is having breathing
difficulty including a guest who might be experiencing
a heart attack. A non-rebreathing mask is a
combination mask and reservoir bag (Figure 12.10).
Oxygen fills the reservoir bag, which is attached to the
mask by a one-way valve. Exhaled air escapes through
flapper valve ports on the sides of the mask. These
valves prevent the guest from rebreathing exhaled
gases, delivering oxygen at a concentration of about
90%. To be effective, a non-rebreathing mask must be

Pulse Oximetry
Routinely administering supplemental oxygen to
guests with medical conditions unrelated to drowning
requires some caution. Evidence suggests that if a guest
is having serious difficulty breathing, lifeguards should
apply oxygen. For others, however, supplemental
oxygen use over time should be adjusted in response
to the percentage of oxygen in the blood and how the
guest feels. The percentage of oxygen in the blood can
be determined using pulse oximetry, which involves

placing a small, portable device called a pulse oximeter
saturation.
on a guest’s finger (Figure 12.12).
A pulse oximeter provides a measurement that appears as a percentage of hemoglobin saturated with oxygen.
If you have a pulse oximeter available, you should use it to help guide how much supplemental oxygen should
be provided to achieve a target saturation of 94–98% for most acutely ill guests. Guests with known chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as emphysema, will usually have a saturation between 88% - 92%.
The guest should be constantly monitored and if the guest’s oxygen level gets above the desired percentage,
you may decrease the flow rate of oxygen or remove the oxygen. The guest should be monitored. If the guest’s
condition worsens or the pulse oximeter shows a reading of less than 94%, supplemental oxygen may be reapplied.
See Table 12.1 for an overview of the administration of oxygen to a responsive guest in respiratory distress.

But to ensure optimum performance, your SOS should
be checked at the beginning of each workday as part
of your facility’s opening procedures. Aquatic facilities
often equip an emergency response bag with SOS
equipment so that all items are available in one bag
when responding to an emergency. Other items in the
bag typically include bag-valve-masks, manual suction,
resuscitation masks, gloves, first aid supplies, pulse
oximeter, an automated external defibrillator (AED),
and AED supplies (Figure 12.13). Use of a trauma type
bag also provides a safe place for the oxygen cylinder Figure 12.13 Check your equipment bag each day to

The use of the SOS should be integrated into your facility’s EAP. Protocols can be as simple as designating a
member of the lifeguard team or supplemental responder to bring the SOS to the rescuer.
Follow these guidelines for the proper care, maintenance, and use of your SOS:
• Do not expose the cylinder to temperatures above 130°F (54°C)
• Do not puncture or drop the cylinder
• Do not use any type of grease or oil (or petroleum jelly or suntan oil) on any part of the cylinder
• Do not use oxygen near a fire or open flame
• Do not remove the valve from the oxygen cylinder
• Have the cylinders refilled by a professional medical oxygen supplier
• Keep the cylinder secure in a carrying case. If you must remove the cylinder from its protective case, lay it down
• Replace masks, one-way valves, and oxygen tubing following use
• Depending on the equipment you have, the system may or may not be left assembled at the end of each

FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
During certain medical events such as near-drownings, oxygen is cut off from vital organs. Supplemental oxygen
should be provided to any guest experiencing breathing problems from a drowning event or other illness or injury
resulting in severe respiratory distress.
Though delivering rescue breaths provides adequate oxygenation, providing a higher concentration of supplemental
oxygen can improve a resuscitation effort.
The availability of a supplemental oxygen system (SOS), allows you to successfully deliver higher levels of oxygen to
distressed guests. The system is simple and safe to use, providing a continuous flow rate of 15 liters per minute (lpm).
A bag-valve-mask (BVM) is a device used to provide ventilations to a nonbreathing guest by attaching a resuscitation
mask to one end of a self-refilling bag and the other end of the bag to the SOS.
For a guest who is breathing, but showing signs of severe respiratory distress, oxygen can be provided through a non-

A pulse oximeter provides a measurement of oxygen saturation in a guest with difficulty breathing. This will help
you when administering supplemental oxygen to achieve a target saturation of 94–98% for most acutely ill guests.
Monitor the guest until EMS personnel arrive.

Caring For Injuries 125
Introduction
As a lifeguard, you must determine when it is necessary to activate your emergency action plan (EAP) and
know what care to provide to injured guests until more advanced medical personnel arrive. Providing care in
the first few minutes following a serious injury can minimize damage and potentially save lives. Some of the
more common injuries that occur in the aquatic environment involve those such as wounds, strains, sprains,
and fractures.
Scene Safety
Before you can provide emergency care to an injured guest, you must be certain the scene is safe. If it is
unsafe, do not enter or allow others to enter the scene until it can be made safe. Unsafe scenes include
those with toxic substances, live electrical wires, and fire. In some cases, you will have to wait for public safety
professionals (EMS, fire, police) to make the scene safe. As part of Scene Safety, follow standard precautions by
putting on necessary personal protective equipment before having contact with a guest.
Assessing Injured Guests
Assessment of a guest begins with the Primary Check, designed to locate and care for conditions that are
immediately life-threatening. Once you have determined that there are no life-threatening conditions, you can
do a secondary check. The Secondary Check identifies conditions that are not immediately life-threatening but
may require care. During this check, you will search for signs of injury such as an open wound or a deformed
arm, and listen closely to guests describing how they are feeling, including the degree of pain.
Use the mnemonic DOTS to help you remember what signs of injury to look for as you check the guest.
DOTS stands for:
• Deformity
• Open wound
• Tenderness (pain)
• Swelling
Injured guests often have isolated injuries that they will be able to point out, so you can focus your attention
on that area of the body (e.g. sprained ankle). Others may have suffered injuries to multiple areas of the body,
requiring a more thorough physical check of the entire body.
To perform a physical check as part of the secondary assessment, start at the head and end at the toes. Using
DOTS, look and feel as you move down the body (Figure 13.1, 13.2). Communicate with the guest as you
complete this check. Ask what happened so that you can determine the cause of the injury. Ask the guest to

--- Page 138 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 126
describe any pain. You can also gather additional information for Emergency Medical Services (EMS) providers,
such as a guest’s medical history. If the guest is wearing a medical alert bracelet or necklace, ask the guest
about the condition.
Figure 13.1 Begin your physical check at the guest’ head. Figure 13.2 Complete your physical check with the lower
limbs.
Wounds
Providing emergency care for injuries involving wounds can minimize the damage, reduce the chance of
infection, and even save lives for those with severe bleeding. Wounds are either open (external bleeding) or
closed (internal bleeding).
Types of Bleeding
There are three types of bleeding:
• Capillary bleeding – Minor bleeding where capillaries are damaged and blood oozes from a wound. This
is often seen when the top layer of skin is damaged. This bleeding is easily controlled
• Venous bleeding – Steady blood flow from veins that can be serious due to the volume of blood loss. This
is often more difficult to control than capillary bleeding
• Arterial bleeding – Blood spurting from an artery with each heartbeat. When an artery is damaged, it can
bleed quickly, causing rapid blood loss that is harder to control than venous or capillary bleeding

--- Page 139 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 127
Open Wounds
Open wounds include:
• Abrasion – Commonly called scrape, rug burn, or
road rash (Figure 13.3)
• Incision – Smooth-edge cut, often seen with
very sharp, thin objects such as a razor blade, or
paper edge
• Laceration – Jagged-edge cut that tears away
skin tissue, caused by items such as irregular
broken glass, or a saw
Figure 13.3 An abrasion is a common type of open wound
• Puncture – Injury from a pointed object that
occurring at aquatic facilities.
penetrates the skin, such as a nail, icepick, or
bullet
• Avulsion – Tissue torn away and hanging from the body
• Amputation – Injury resulting in the loss of a body part, such as a finger or toe
• Impaled object – Injury where an object, such as a nail, knife, or glass has punctured the skin and is
impaled (embedded) in the body
External Bleeding
Caring for an open wound involves protecting against disease transmission, stopping the external bleeding,
and reducing the chance of infection.
Dressings and Bandages
Bandages and dressings are items commonly found in first aid kits and are used to control external bleeding.
Dressings are often sterile gauze pads that are placed over an open wound to help prevent infection and
absorb blood. Dressings vary in size from 2, 3, or 4-inch squares, to much larger and thicker ones for more
serious wounds.
A bandage is used to cover and hold a dressing in place while maintaining pressure over the wound. A roll of
gauze is a common bandage. Like dressings, bandages also come in various sizes.
Care for External Bleeding
Follow these steps to care for open wounds:
• Use Standard Precautions before providing care
• For shallow wounds, wash the wound, apply an antibiotic ointment, and cover the wound

--- Page 140 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 128
• For larger, deeper wounds, you must focus on
stopping the bleeding. Place a dressing over
the wound and apply direct pressure with your
gloved hand (Figure 13.4)
• Use a roll of gauze to wrap a bandage in a spiral
pattern over the entire dressing. The bandage
should be snug but not too tight that it constricts
all circulation. This will help maintain pressure
and keep the wound clean until the guest can
receive proper medical care (Figure 13.5)
• If bleeding continues and the gauze becomes
soaked, apply additional gauze and bandage over
Figure 13.4 Apply a gauze pad and pressure to control
the first layer
bleeding from an open wound.
• Call 9-1-1 if bleeding is severe or cannot be
controlled
• If an object is impaled (embedded) anywhere in
the body, leave the object in place and stabilize
it until EMS personnel arrive. This can be done
by holding it in place or by placing rolls of gauze
around the object and bandaging it to restrict
movement
For an amputated body part, such as a finger, toe,
or larger limb, stop the bleeding with pressure and
bandage. Retrieve the severed part with a gauze pad,
place it in a container such as a plastic bag, and keep Figure 13.5 Wrap roller gauze in a spiral pattern to maintain
the part cool if possible (Figure 13.6). Provide the pressure and stop bleeding. Use roller gauze to stabilize an
severed part to EMS personnel when they arrive. impaled object.
Hemostatic Gauze and
Tourniquets
Hemostatic gauze dressings are advances in care for
severe external bleeding that help promote clotting.
These gauze dressings can be applied to areas of
the body other than just the limbs. Apply pressure
in the same manner as you would for regular gauze
dressings. Hemostatic gauze is embedded with a
shellfish-derived polysaccharide that quickly promotes
Figure 13.6 6 Keep an amputated part clean and cool.
clot formation.

--- Page 141 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 129
QuikClot® is a hemostatic dressing impregnated
with kaolin clay. Kaolin triggers factors in the blood
that result in rapid clotting. Hemostatic agents are
available in many stores, including those for outdoor
adventure, as well as pharmacies (Figure 13.7).
Tourniquets are used to control life-threatening
bleeding from extremity wounds that would
otherwise be unlikely to be controlled with normal
procedures such as direct pressure and bandaging and
hemostatic gauze. They are available commercially,
or can be improvised from a belt, stretch band, or
Figure 13.7 QuikClot® hemostatic dressing.
triangle bandage. Tourniquets may be necessary in
situations such as:
• Incidents involving high-velocity gunshot
wounds, stabbings, or blast injuries involving
the limbs
• Serious limb injuries in rural or wilderness
areas, including industrial or farm injuries where
resources are limited, and transport delayed
Tourniquets provide circumferential pressure to
the limb. Once tightened, bleeding will cease, and
pressure can be maintained through transport of the
injured guest by EMS personnel (Figure 13.8).
Figure 13.8 A tourniquet is applied to life-threatening
bleeding from an extremity.
Internal Bleeding
Closed wounds involve internal bleeding and result
from blunt injury that does not break the skin (Figure
13.9). Since the injury is beneath the skin it can be
hard to determine the extent of the damage.
Signs of internal bleeding can include:
• Bruising
• Swelling
• Tenderness
• For injuries to the organs of the chest or
abdomen the guest might cough up or vomit
Figure 13.9 A bruise is an example of a closed wound.
blood or have bloody stool

--- Page 142 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 130
Care for Internal Bleeding
Internal bleeding from common injuries to extremities, such as a bruised leg or twisted ankle, is best cared for
by following the mnemonic RICE, which stands for:
• Rest – Stop using the injured body part
• Ice – Apply ice for up to 20 minutes
• Compression – Apply an elastic bandage for several hours when possible
• Elevation – Raise an injured limb
More serious internal bleeding, such as abdominal bleeding, requires more advanced care. Call 911. Care for
shock by placing the guest on his/her back and keeping the guest warm.
Burns
There are four types of burns:
• Thermal (Heat)
• Chemical
• Electrical
• Radiation
Thermal burns are caused by contact with heat, including flames, hot liquids, steam, and hot solid objects.
Chemical burns are the result of exposure to chemicals, such as dry powers, liquids, or gases. Electrical burns
can be caused by contact with electrical wires, outlets, power supply lines, and lightning. Radiation burns
involve damage to the skin as a result of exposure to radiation, most commonly the sun.
Burn Classifications
Burns are classified according to the depth or severity
of tissue damage that occurs (Figure 13.10):
• First degree burns (Superficial) – Burns affecting
the outer layers of skin. The skin is often red,
swollen, and tender. Sunburn is a common
example of a superficial burn
• Second degree burns (Partial thickness) – Burns
affecting deeper layers of skin. The skin is swollen,
tender, and blisters in a variety of sizes form on
Figure 13.10 Burns are classified according to the extent
the skin’s surface
of injury.
• Third degree burns (Full-thickness) – Burns affecting
all layers of the skin and underlying fat. Nerves, blood vessels, and muscle can also be affected. The skin can
appear charred, gray, waxy, or leathery. If nerve endings are damaged, the exact area of the full-thickness burn
may be painless, but the guest will feel pain from the surrounding lesser damaged areas.

--- Page 143 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 131
Assessing the Extent of Burns
The extent of burn damage is not always immediately recognizable. It may take a little time to see the full
extent of a burn, such as the formation of blisters. The severity of the burn injury includes an estimate of the
total surface area affected. This can rapidly be assessed by using the Rule of the Hand. The size of the guest’s
hand is equal to approximately 1% of the total surface area of the guest’s body. Estimate the extent of damage
by counting the approximate number of hands it would take to cover the burned area.
Guests may suffer all three levels of severity during the same incident. Burns are more serious on certain parts
of the body, such as the head, neck, chest, genitals, hands, and feet. Burns are also more serious for young
children and the elderly. Care for any burn based on the type of burn, the highest level of severity, and the
extent of the burn.
Caring for Thermal Burns
To care for 1st degree Thermal burns:
• Stop the burning process and reduce the pain by applying cool water
• Once the burn cools, apply aloe vera gel or a skin moisturizer
• Control pain and swelling with an over-the-counter medication such as ibuprofen
To care for 2nd degree thermal burns covering less than 10 percent of the body:
• Stop the burning process and reduce the pain by applying cool water
• Loosely cover the burn with a nonstick dressing and bandage, taking care not to apply pressure to any
blisters
• Control pain and swelling with an over-the-counter medication such as ibuprofen
• Seek medical care
To care for 2nd degree burns of more than 10 percent of the body, and all 3rd degree burns:
• Stop the burning process and reduce the pain by applying cool water
• Do not attempt to remove any clothing stuck to the skin
• Cover the burn with a cool, moist dressing and bandage loosely
• Care for shock
• Call 9-1-1
Caring for Chemical Burns
Acids and alkalies are examples of caustic or corrosive chemicals that can result in burns. Organic compounds,
including petroleum products can also cause chemical burns. To care for chemical burns:
• Remove the chemicals from the skin as quickly as possible by flushing the burned area with a large
amount of water. Flush continuously for up to 20 minutes, or until EMS personnel arrive if summoned
(Figure 13.11)

--- Page 144 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 132
• If the chemical is a dry power, brush the powder
from the skin. Flush with water.
• If your job involves working with chemicals,
follow the instructions provided on your Safety
Data Sheets (SDS) for the proper care if an
incident occurs
Caring for Electrical Burns
Exposure to electric current can disrupt normal heart
function and cause internal injuries as well as burns. A
guest with an electrical burn may have more than one
burn. This situation is known as an entrance and exit
wound.
To care for electrical burns:
• Check responsiveness and breathing and provide
CPR/AED if needed
• Look for entry and exit wounds. If found, cover Figure 13.11 Flush chemical burns continuously with
the wounds loosely with dry, nonstick gauze pads water.
and bandage loosely
• Call 9-1-1
Caution!
Always make sure the source of any electric burn has been controlled before you provide care for the
guest. Disconnect any power to be sure that you will not be injured while providing care. If you are
unable to verify that the power is off, wait until the appropriate safety personnel arrive.
Head Injuries
Head injuries can include damage to the skull and face and involve external or internal bleeding and injuries
that affect the brain.
Skull Fracture
A Skull Fracture is any break in the cranial bone, also known as the skull, due to significant force. Signs of skull
fracture can include:
• Loss of consciousness
• Pain

--- Page 145 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 133
• Deformity of the skull, including sunken area or bone fragments
• Clear or bloody fluid from the ears or nose
• Heavy bleeding
• Exposed brain matter
• Penetrating injury from a gunshot or other significant force
To care for a guest with a skull fracture:
• Check responsiveness and breathing and provide care as needed
• Place a sterile dressing (gauze pad or other clean
item) over the wound
• Apply pressure along the edges of the dressing,
not directly over any weak area of the skull
(Figure 13.12)
• Restrict movement of the guest’s head
• Call 9-1-1
Concussion
Concussion is a brain injury, often caused by a blow to

dressing to control bleeding from a skull fracture.
Most concussions are mild, and the guest will usually
fully recover. But the time it takes a guest to recover can vary greatly depending on the extent of the injury.
Signs of concussion can include:
• Loss of consciousness
• Loss of memory
• Headache, dizziness, or nausea
• Problems with vision or balance
• Ringing in the ears
To care for a guest with a possible concussion, position the guest on his/her back and restrict movement of the
head and neck. Call 9-1-1.
Scalp Wounds
The scalp has many blood vessels close to the surface, so even a small cut can produce the appearance of
severe bleeding. The bleeding from the scalp does not affect the brain. Care for scalp wounds in the same way
you would care for external bleeding elsewhere on the body:
• Place a sterile gauze pad (or other clean dressing) over the wound
• Apply direct pressure over the wound to stop the bleeding

--- Page 146 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 134
• Bandage the wound whenever possible
(Figure 13.13)
• Position the guest on his/her back with the head
and shoulders slightly elevated
• Call 9-1-1 if bleeding cannot be controlled or the
wound is large or deep
Loose Object in the Eye
Objects that enter the eye can be irritating, and in
some cases, cause significant damage. To care for a
small, loose object in the eye, such as dirt or sand:
Figure 13.13 Apply a dressing and pressure bandage for a
• Hold the eye open
scalp wound.
• Rinse with water
• Seek medical care if you are unable to remove
the loose object
Chemicals in the Eye
Chemicals in the eye, such as an acid or alkaline
solution, can burn and cause blindness. These
emergencies require immediate care. To care for a
guest with a chemical in the eyes:
• Hold the eyes open and continuously flush
with water. If only one eye is affected, close the
unaffected eye during this process (Figure 13.14)
• Call 9-1-1 and continue to flush the eyes until
EMS personnel arrive
Figure 13.14 To remove chemicals from the eyes, flush
Blow to the Eye continuously until EMS personnel arrive.
A blow to the eye can result in swelling and discoloration (black eye), or more severe damage that threatens
eyesight. To care for a blow to the eye:
• Have the guest close the eye and then apply ice or a cold pack to reduce pain and swelling
• Seek medical care if there is significant pain, vision problems, or discoloration of the eyeball

--- Page 147 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 135
Eye Avulsion
A significant blow to the eye can knock the eyeball from its socket. To care for an eye avulsion:
• Cover the injured eye loosely with a moist sterile dressing (gauze pad or other clean dressing). Do not
place pressure on the eyeball or attempt to replace the eyeball in the socket
• A paper cup can be held in place over the dressing to further protect the eyeball from injury
• Have the guest close the uninjured eye
• Call 9-1-1
Penetrating Eye Injury
A sharp object can easily penetrate the eyeball. The object may have been withdrawn or remain in place
(impaled) in the eye. To care for a penetrating eye injury:
• If the object remains in the eyeball, apply dressings around the object to movement, and hold the object
still
• Have the guest close the uninjured eye
• Call 9-1-1
Cut of the Eye or Lid
A cut of the eye or lid can be serious. To care for a cut of the eye or lid:
• Do not apply any pressure to the eyeball
• If just the eyelid is cut, apply a gauze pad and light pressure
• Have the guest close the uninjured eye
• Call 9-1-1
Cheek Injuries
If an object has penetrated the cheek and the guest has bleeding into the mouth, follow these steps:
• Place a dressing and pressure on the outside and inside of the cheek
• If an object is impaled in the cheek, hold the object in place
• Call 9-1-1
Nosebleed
Nosebleeds are common injuries that occur when people are struck in the nose, or as the result of excessive
heat drying mucous membranes.

--- Page 148 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 136
To care for nosebleeds:
• Have the guest sit down and lean slightly forward
• Have the guest pinch the nostrils together for
about 5 minutes (Figure 13.15)
• Call 9-1-1 if the bleeding cannot be controlled or
if the guest has an associated medical condition
such as high blood pressure that may be
contributing to the bleeding
Mouth Injuries
Figure 13.15 To care for a nosebleed, have the guest sit

and lean slightly forward and apply pressure.
or lips. To care for a wound to the tongue or lips:
• If a closed wound is present, apply ice or a cold pack to reduce swelling and pain
• If an open wound is present, control external bleeding by applying a dressing and direct pressure
• If the bleeding does not stop, seek medical care
To care for a knocked-out (avulsed) tooth (Figure 13.16):
• Place a folded gauze pad in the socket to control
bleeding
• Locate the missing tooth, hold it by the crown,
and rinse it gently
• Keep the tooth moist until the guest can get to
the dentist or to a hospital
• If reinsertion is not possible, place the tooth in
an emergency tooth preservation kit (such as
Save-a-Tooth®), Hanks Balanced Salt Solution,
coconut water, milk, or a saltwater solution Figure 13.16 Care for a knocked-out tooth by controlling
(1 teaspoon salt in 1 quart of water) bleeding and saving the missing tooth.
• If no other fluids are available, have the guest
spit into a small cup or plastic bag. Place the tooth in the saliva. It does not matter if there is blood mixed
with the saliva
• Get the guest to a dentist promptly so the tooth can be successfully replaced in its socket
• If more serious injuries exist, call 9-1-1

Caring For Injuries 137
Spinal Injuries
The spinal column, is comprised of 33 bones, commonly called vertebrae, stacked upon one another.
These bones make up five regions of the spine:
• Cervical (neck)
• Thoracic (chest/trunk)
• Lumbar (low back)
• Sacral (pelvic)
• Coccyx (tailbone)
The cervical spine has 7 vertebrae that function to support the weight of the head. The thoracic spine has
12 vertebrae attached to the ribs that help protect the organs of the chest, such as the heart and lungs. The
lumbar spine has 5 vertebrae, which bear the weight of the body and absorb the stress of lifting and carrying
heavy objects. The sacral spine, or sacrum, is formed by 5 vertebrae fused together connecting the spine to the
hip bones. At the end of the spinal column is the coccyx or tailbone, comprised of 4 fused bones that provide
attachment for ligaments and muscles of the pelvic floor.
Spinal injuries can involve the spinal column, or the bundle of spinal nerves known as the spinal cord.
Recreational and sport activities are among the ways in which spinal injuries can occur. Additional movement
of someone with a spinal injury could potentially damage the spinal cord, so precautions must be taken to
prevent any excessive movement.
Recognizing Spinal Injuries
Signs of spinal injuries can include:
• Loss of consciousness
• Neck or back pain or tenderness
• Neck deformity
• Limb weakness, numbness, or tingling
• Paralysis
Care for Spinal Injuries
To care for possible spinal injuries:
Figure 13.17 Spinal motion restriction (SMR) includes
• Tell the guest not to attempt to move
holding the head still and in-line with body when possible.
• Restrict movement of the head and neck with
Spinal Motion Restriction (SMR) (Figure 13.17)
• Call 9-1-1

--- Page 150 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 138
Pelvic and Hip Injuries
Pelvic injuries can range in severity from minor to life-threatening. A pelvic fracture can occur as a result of
a high impact injury, such as a motor vehicle collision or fall from a height. But the same fracture could also
occur from lower impact, such as an elderly guest slipping from a chair and striking the ground. Pelvic fractures
have the potential for severe bleeding from blood vessels within the pelvis.
The hip joints are at the lower areas of the pelvis. These areas are susceptible to hip dislocation if the head of
the femur (large bone in the upper leg) is displaced out of the joint. This can compromise important nerves in
the lower limbs.
Recognizing Pelvic and Hip Injuries
The signs of pelvic and hip injuries can include:
• Inability to stand or walk
• Hip or groin pain or tenderness
• Loss of feeling in the injured limb
• Knee drawn toward the chest and thigh rotated inward, or the leg extended and rotated outward
• Shock
Care for Pelvic and Hip Injuries
To care for pelvic and hip injuries:
• Support the guest in the most comfortable position. This may be with the legs bent or straight. Do not
attempt to move the legs if the guest complains of pain
• Call 9-1-1
Chest Injuries
Chest injuries can be open or closed. Common closed chest injuries involve bruising, caused by blunt force
trauma. More serious closed chest injuries can involve rib fractures. Open chest injury occurs when the chest wall
is penetrated by an object such as a fractured rib, knife, or bullet. The object could also be impaled in the chest.
Closed Chest Injuries
Rib fractures can involve an individual rib or multiple ribs. If multiple ribs in the same area are each broken in
multiple places, the condition is known as a flail chest.

--- Page 151 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 139
The signs of rib fractures include:
• Pain, especially when breathing or coughing
• Difficulty breathing, including the inability to take a deep breath
• Tenderness
To care for closed chest injuries, such as rib fractures:
• Place the guest in the most comfortable position for breathing and pain relief. This is often a seated position
• To help stabilize the ribs, place a folded towel, blanket, or pillow against the injured side and have the
guest hold it in place with his/her arm
• Call 9-1-1
Open Chest Injuries
Open chest injuries are those that penetrate the chest wall. An object causing the damage, such as a knife, can
be withdrawn or remain embedded. A chest injury that allows air to pass into and out of the chest cavity is a
sucking chest wound. This is recognized by the sound of air being sucked into and out of the chest wound, as
well as bubbling blood at the site of the wound.
To care for open chest injuries:
• Control any significant bleeding present
• If a sucking chest wound is present and a dressing and direct pressure are required to stop bleeding, care
must be taken to ensure that a blood saturated dressing does not inadvertently occlude the wound.
• If there is little bleeding with a sucking chest wound, leave the wound exposed.
• Call 9-1-1
Abdomen Injuries
Like injuries to the chest, abdomen injuries can also be closed or open, and can be minor or severe.
Closed Abdomen Injuries
Closed injuries to the abdomen occur from a direct blow from a blunt object. The injured area may appear
bruised, painful, tender, or tight. To care for closed abdominal injuries:
• Place the guest in a comfortable position. This is often on the back or side, with the knees bent
• Care for shock by keeping the guest warm
• Seek medical care. Call 9-1-1 for incapacitating injuries

--- Page 152 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 140
Open Abdomen Injuries
Though rare, injuries that penetrate the abdomen can result in organs protruding from the abdomen. This is a serious
condition, known as an abdominal evisceration, that requires immediate care. To care for an abdominal evisceration:
• Place the guest on his/her back with knees bent
• Gently cover the protruding organs loosely with a moist, sterile dressing. Do not try to reinsert the organs
• Care for shock by keeping the guest warm
• Call 9-1-1
Joint, Bone, And
Muscle Injuries
Joint Injuries
Figure 13.18 A dislocated little finger.
Injuries to joints can be sprains or dislocations. A
sprain occurs when the ligaments surrounding the
joint are stretched or torn. The most common sprains
involve the ankles, wrists, and knees. Dislocations are
more serious injuries in which a bone end comes out
of the joint, such as the shoulder, elbow, knee, ankle,
finger, or toe (Figure 13.18).
Signs of sprains and dislocations include:
• Pain
• Deformity
• Inability to use the affected limb normally
If you suspect the joint is only sprained, use RICE
Figure 13.19 Use the RICE approach to care for joint
(Figure 13.19). If you believe the joint is dislocated,
injuries such as a sprained ankle.
splint the injured limb as you would a fracture.
Call 9-1-1.
Bone Injuries
Injuries to bones can involve simple bruising or a
serious break in a bone, commonly called a fracture.
Most fractures are closed, where the bone does not
break the skin (Figure 13.20). A fewer number of
bone injuries involve open fractures, where the bone
end has broken through the skin.
Use the mnemonic DOTS, as previously discussed, to
Figure 13.20 A closed fracture of the left wrist.
help identify a possible serious bone injury such as

--- Page 153 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 141
a fracture. Another good indication that a bone is likely broken is the guest’s inability to use the injured part
normally. The guest may not be able to move the affected limb or bear weight or walk on an injured leg or
foot. The guest may also complain of hearing or feeling the bone snap. The bone ends may also rub against
each other creating a grating sensation that can be heard or felt.
Though rarely life-threatening, all serious bone injuries
require further evaluation in a hospital to ensure
proper care and a return to normal function. The initial
care you provide can help reduce the guest’s anxiety
and keep the guest from moving the injured area.
To care for a possible fracture, splint the affected
area. Splinting is the process of stabilizing a possible
fracture to prevent further damage to bone, muscles,
nerves, and blood vessels. There are three common
types of splints that can be used for a fracture:
• Anatomic (self) splint – The injured part of the
body is secured to an uninjured part, such as an Figure 13.21 Anatomic splint.
injured arm bound to the chest, or an injured
finger taped to an adjacent finger (Figure 13.21)
• Soft splint – A soft splint is made from items such
as a pillow, towel, blanket, or coat wrapped around
the injured part and tied in place. This type of bulky
material helps limit movement of the injured part
(Figure 13.22)
• Rigid splint – A rigid splint can be made from
rolled newspaper, magazines, heavy cardboard,
or wood or metal strips. Any inflexible material
tied in place can be used to support an injured

Apply an ice or cold pack if possible, to help reduce
the swelling and pain. If an open fracture is present,
do not apply pressure to any protruding bone. Cover
the area with a dressing and bandage loosely. Call
9-1-1 for any open fractures.

Caring For Injuries 142
A sling is a device that can be used to support an
injured hand, wrist, arm, or shoulder. Slings can be
made from triangle bandages found in first aid kits.
The guest’s bent arm is splinted and rests in the
sling, which can be further secured by tying a binder
across the chest (Figure 13.24). A sling can also be
fashioned using the guest’s clothing and a safety pin
(Figure 13.25).
Muscle Injuries
Common muscle injuries involve: Figure 13.24 Sling and binder made with triangle bandages.
• Strain – An overstretched or partially torn
muscle. This occurs to muscles such as the back
when heavy objects are lifted improperly. Other
common muscle strains involve the legs caused
by running
• Bruise – A bruise that results from a direct blow
to the muscle
• Cramp – Uncontrolled muscle spasm that can be
quite painful
Provide initial care for muscle strains or bruises
involving the limbs by following the mnemonic RICE
previously discussed. Care for muscle cramps by having

the guest apply pressure to the affected muscle until the
cramp subsides.
Shock
Shock is a medical emergency in which the organs and tissues of the body are not receiving an adequate flow
of blood. This deprives the organs and tissues of necessary oxygen and nutrients. Shock can occur as a result
of injury or illness.
Types of Shock
There are several different types of shock including:
• Anaphylactic shock – Severe allergic reaction
• Cardiogenic shock – Heart attack with damage to the heart so severe it cannot pump blood effectively
• Hypovolemic shock – Severe blood loss from external or internal bleeding, or loss of body fluid from
burns and dehydration
• Metabolic shock – When fluids and electrolytes are impaired, such as with a diabetic emergency

--- Page 155 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 143
• Neurogenic shock – Injury to the nervous system (spinal cord, brain)
• Psychogenic shock – Shock resulting from overwhelming emotional factors such as fainting
• Septic shock – An acute infection that overwhelms the body resulting in poisonous substances
accumulating in the blood
Recognizing Shock
The signs of shock can vary somewhat based on the type of shock. In general, the signs of shock associated
with injuries include:
• Altered consciousness/confusion
• Anxiety and restlessness
• Pale, bluish, cool, moist skin
• Nausea or vomiting
• Rapid breathing and heart rate
• In neurogenic shock, the heart rate can be slow,
and the skin warm, dry, and flushed
Care for Shock
To care for shock (Figure 13.26):
• Position the guest on his/her back whenever
possible. If breathing problems exist, the guest
will likely need to be supported in a seated or
slightly reclined position to make breathing easier
• Maintain normal body temperature
Figure 13.26 General shock position.
• Call 9-1-1
Emergency Moves
Injured guests are not normally moved until they can be adequately assessed and care provided. But there may
be a time when a dangerous scene cannot be secured, requiring the guest to be moved immediately. Before
moving a guest consider the:
• Possible condition of the guest such as spinal injury or limb fracture
• Size and weight of the guest
• Your size and strength
• The surface upon which you must move the guest (e.g. flat and smooth, rugged, steps)
• Whether other responders are available to assist

--- Page 156 Text ---
Caring For Injuries 144
There are three categories of emergency moves:
• Assists - An assist can be used by one or two rescuers to support the guest to walk or hop to safety
(Figure 13.27, 13.28)
• Drags – A drag can be used to move a guest over a flat smooth surface. Grasp the guest under the armpits
and rest the guest’s head on your forearms. Walk carefully backward while pulling the guest. An ankle
drag can be used if the guest is too large to move in another manner
• Carries – A carry can be used by one or two rescuers to lift and move the guest. This could be a piggyback
carry, cradle carry, or two-rescuer seat carry. If a backboard and additional rescuers are readily available,
the guest can be placed on the backboard and carried to safety.
Figure 13.27 One rescuer walking assist. Figure 13.28 Two rescuer walking assist.
Triage
Triage is the process of determining the priority of guest care based on the severity of the condition. It is used
when the number of injured or ill guests exceeds the number of rescuers. This could occur in situations such as
a disaster, an active shooter incident, or chemical poisoning.
Triage requires you to decide the order of guest care once the scene is safe. If guests can walk, they rarely have
immediately life-threatening conditions. These “walking wounded” can be told to quickly move away from the
scene to designated safe area where they can care for one another until more rescuers arrive.
Move quickly among the remaining guests. Spend about 30 seconds on each guest to quickly assess the
conditions. Return and care for the most seriously injured or ill first. Once you have tended to the needs of the
most severe conditions, move on to those with lesser conditions. By this time EMS personnel will likely take
over.
During triage, classify guests according to these priorities:
• Immediate – Breathing difficulty, severe bleeding, severe burns, shock, or unresponsive
• Delayed – Less serious burns, bone or joint injuries, back injuries that restrict movement
• Minor – Minor wounds or bone or joint injuries
• Deceased – Obviously dead or unlikely to survive due to the extent of injury.

FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
As a lifeguard, you need to be able to determine when to activate the emergency action plan (EAP) and be aware
of what care you need to provide to those injured until more advanced medical personnel arrive. Before you can
provide emergency care to an injured guest, you must be certain the scene is safe. Assessment of a guest begins
with the primary check, designed to locate and care for conditions that are immediately life-threatening. Once
you have determined that there are no life-threatening conditions, you can do a secondary check.
There are three types of bleeding: capillary, venous, and arterial that may result from various types of wounds.
Care for serious external bleeding by applying direct pressure with a dressing and bandage over the wound.
Stabilize impaled objects to avoid further movement and tissue damage. To care for an amputation, stop the
bleeding and save the severed part. Internal bleeding can occur as a result of blunt force. You should care for
internal bleeding by following the RICE mnemonic.
There are four types of burns: thermal, chemical, electrical, and radiation. Burns are classified based on the depth
of damage: first degree (superficial), second degree (partial thickness), and third degree (full thickness). Care for
any burns is based on the type of burn, the highest level of severity, and the extent of the burn. Burn care should
focus on stopping the burning process, minimizing further injury, and determining the need for more advanced
care. Seek medical care for more serious burns, including calling 9-1-1 for the most serious burns.
When you suspect a possible injury to the head or spine, apply spinal motion restriction (SMR) to keep the guest
from moving until EMS personnel arrive. Injuries to the head and spine often result from falls and blunt trauma.
For loose objects or chemicals in the eyes, hold the eyes open and continuously flush with water. If only one
eye is affected, close the unaffected eye during this process.
Injuries to the chest and abdomen can result in bruising, pain, tenderness, and difficulty breathing. Call 9-1-1
for serious conditions such as possible rib fractures, and open chest or abdominal injuries. You should carefully
cover any protruding abdominal organs with a moist, sterile dressing.
Muscle injuries include bruises, strains, and cramps. Joint injuries can include sprains or dislocations. Use
RICE as general care for sprains and strains. Bones can be bruised or fractured. Care for possible fractures and
dislocations by splinting the injured area. Call 9-1-1 for serious conditions.
Shock is a condition in which organs and tissues of the body are not receiving an adequate flow of blood and
oxygen, often resulting from various types of injuries. Signs of shock include altered consciousness, anxiety,
restlessness, and pale, cool, moist skin. Care for shock by placing the guest on his or her back whenever
possible and maintain normal body temperature.

Caring For Sudden Illnesses 148
Allergic Reactions
Approximately one million people visit emergency departments each year as a result of severe allergic
reactions. Most of these reactions affect teens and young adults.
The immune system produces antibodies (protective proteins) to remove unwanted foreign substances. An
allergen, which is a substance that causes an allergic reaction, produces an abnormally vigorous response from
the immune system, causing it to fight off a perceived threat that would otherwise be harmless. Antibodies
also bind to specialized cells that release inflammatory chemicals that include histamine. This has several
effects on the body:
• Constricting (narrowing) specialized smooth muscle, causing breathing difficulty
• Dilating (widening) blood vessels resulting in skin flushing (red)
• Inflammation resulting in swelling
• Movement of fluid normally found inside blood vessels (plasma) to spacing outside the blood vessels,
causing a decrease in blood volume and dangerously low blood pressure
Causes of Allergic Reactions
There are many items that can cause allergic reactions. Food allergies including milk, eggs, nuts, soy, wheat,
fish, and shellfish are the most common cause of allergic reactions, affecting nearly 15 million people annually.
Other items that can cause allergic reactions include:
• Insect bites and stings
• Medications such as antibiotics and pain medications
• Poisonous plants
• Latex
• Dyes used in medical procedures
Recognizing and Caring for Allergic Reactions
The signs of allergic reactions often appear shortly
after an exposure to an allergen. Depending upon the
substance, however, there could be a delay of more
than an hour. In some individuals, the signs disappear
and return a few hours later. Not everyone affected
by allergic reactions will experience the same thing
(Figure 14.1). Common, less serious signs include:
• Itching
• Red, watery eyes
• Runny nose
• Sneezing
Figure 14.1 Rash from an allergic reaction.
• Mild swelling
• Hives

--- Page 161 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 149
The most serious form of allergic reaction is
anaphylactic shock, commonly called anaphylaxis.
It can occur suddenly following exposure and be life-
threatening. Serious signs of anaphylaxis include
(Figure 14.2):
• Difficulty breathing
• Difficulty swallowing
• Swelling of the face, throat, or tongue
• Rapid heart rate
• Dizziness
• Loss of consciousness
Figure 14.2 Signs of anaphylaxis include swelling of face,

reaction, an antihistamine, such as diphenhydramine
(e.g. Benadryl), an be helpful.
To care for severe allergic reactions:
• Call 9-1-1
• Have the guest rest in the most comfortable position for breathing. This is often a seated position
• Remove any tight clothing that might restrict breathing
• If the guest has a prescribed epinephrine auto injector, assist with its use
• Provide supplemental oxygen support if available
Epinephrine Auto-Injectors
Epinephrine is a hormone that dilates bronchial tubes to make breathing easier. It also increases the heart rate,
muscle strength, blood pressure, and sugar metabolism.
An epinephrine auto-injector is a prescribed medical
device that contains the proper amount of medication
(epinephrine) for adults or children experiencing
anaphylaxis. It is a single dose, disposal device that allows
injection into the thigh. This injection will take a few
minutes to begin to work and will provide temporary
relief for about 20 minutes. The medication is often
available in a “twin pack” with two auto-injectors. This
helps if the first dose of the medication does not relieve
the serious signs before EMS personnel arrive. Two
common epinephrine auto-injectors are Epipen® and

Caring For Sudden Illnesses 150
Before administering epinephrine, examine the medication prior to use:
• Check the device to verify the expiration date is current and that the medication is clear, not discolored
(brownish)
• For a guest greater than 66 lbs. (29 kg), use the adult device. For a guest less than 66 lbs. (29kg), use the
pediatric device
Follow these steps to help a guest administer his/her
prescribed epinephrine auto-injector while waiting for
EMS personnel to arrive:
1. Hold the device firmly so that your fingers are
not near the needle end of the device and
remove the safety cap (Figure 14.4)
2. Place the guest in a seated position and hold the
knee firmly so that the leg does not move during
injection
3. Place the needle end near the outer thigh. The
device will work through clothing, but it is best to
administer it into the bare skin whenever possible
Figure 14.4 Hold the epinephrine injector safely and
4. Press the device firmly in place and hold for

3 to 5 seconds (depending on the device)
(Figure 14.5)
5. Massage the injected area for several seconds
6. Monitor the guest for improvement. If the guest
does not improve in five minutes give a second
dose if available
Following its use, the auto-injector must be properly
discarded in a marked “sharps” container. This can be
done by by providing the used device to arriving EMS
personnel.
The most common side effects of epinephrine include

sweating, headache, nausea and vomiting, and
nervousness or anxiety. These side effects usually go
away quickly.

Caring For Sudden Illnesses 151
Breathing Emergencies
A person can experience breathing problems for a variety of reasons, including respiratory infections, chest or
head injury, heart attack, or asthma.
Recognizing and Caring for Breathing Emergencies
The signs of breathing emergencies include:
• Struggling to breathe
• Unusually fast (hyperventilation) or slow breathing
• Extensive coughing
• Noisy breathing, including gasping and wheezing
• Bluish lips
• Need to pause while speaking
• Fatigue
To care for breathing emergencies:
1. Call 9-1-1
2. Help the guest move into a comfortable breathing position, which is often a seated position
3. If the condition involves a guest hyperventilating as a result of anxiety, attempt to calm the guest and
have the guest hold his/her breath for several seconds and exhale slowly
4. Guests experiencing breathing difficulty may have a condition such as asthma and have an inhaler for
use. Assist the guest in using their prescribed inhaler
5. Provide supplemental oxygen support, if available, to any guest experiencing significant breathing
problems
Recognizing and Caring for Asthma Attack
Asthma is a chronic lung disorder that affects over 24 million people in America, most of whom are adults.
It occurs when inflammation causes the bronchi to swell and narrow the airways. This can create breathing
difficulty that may range from mild to life-threatening. Signs of an asthma attack include shortness of breath,
cough, chest tightness, and wheezing.
Causes of asthma attacks include:
• Infections
• Excessive exercise
• Allergies
• Drug sensitivity
• Cold weather
• Smoke
• Stress

--- Page 164 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 152
Most asthmatics know how to avoid these factors
and are used to dealing with their asthma effectively.
Others, however, may be caught off-guard and
unprepared.
If a guest has an inhaler, you can help the guest use
the device:
1. Shake the inhaler and remove the cap
2. Have the guest exhale forcefully
3. Have the guest place the inhaler to his/her
mouth, depress the button and breathe in
deeply (Figure 14.6)
Figure 14.6 Assist the guest with any prescribed inhaler.
4. Remove the inhaler and have the guest hold
his/her breath for several seconds, then exhale
5. Wait about 30 seconds and repeat steps 2-5
Cold Emergencies
There are two cold emergencies, hypothermia and frostbite. Hypothermia involves general cooling of the
entire body, while frostbite is localized freezing of a body part.
Recognizing and Caring for
Hypothermia
Hypothermia is a condition of abnormally low body
temperature. It occurs when the body loses heat faster
than it can be produced. Body temperature that is too
low affects the brain, causing confusion and slowing
movement.
The signs of hypothermia include:
• Shivering Figure 14.7 Slowly rewarm a guest experiencing
• Confusion hypothermia.
• Drowsiness
• Exhaustion
• Cold skin, even under clothing
To care for hypothermia:
• Warm the guest gradually, replacing any wet, cold clothing with dry clothing and insulation, and cover the head
• If the guest is alert, provide a sugary, non-alcoholic beverage such as hot chocolate (Figure 14.7)
• Call 9-1-1 if the guest’s condition is not improving

--- Page 165 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 153
Recognizing and Caring
for Frostbite
Frostbite occurs when an area of the body freezes and
ice crystals cause damage at the cellular level. Frostbite
commonly affects areas that are exposed or under-
protected, such as the ears, nose, fingers, and toes.
The signs of frostbite include (Figure 14.8):
• Skin appears white, gray, and waxy
• Swelling
• Affected part is cold, painful, or becomes numb Figure 14.8 Swelling and white, gray, waxy skin from
frostbite.
To care for frostbite:
• Get the guest out of the cold
• Remove any cold or wet clothing, as well as any jewelry from the affected part, such as the hand
• Call 9-1-1. Frostbitten parts are best cared for when rewarmed under a controlled environment in a hospital
• If the guest is more than one hour from medical care, rewarm the frostbitten part in water of about
100o F for about 30 minutes. After thawing, do not let the parts refreeze. Place soft dry items such as
gauze pads, between any fingers or toes. Provide a medication such as ibuprofen to help with the pain
and swelling
Diabetic Emergencies
Diabetes is a disease in which the body’s inability to produce adequate insulin causes an elevated blood
sugar (glucose) level. Diabetics must regulate blood sugar and insulin levels through a combination of
medication, diet, and exercise. Any significant imbalance can result in one of two types of diabetic conditions,
hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
Hypoglycemia occurs when the blood sugar level is too low, and the insulin level is too high. It can be caused
by an overdose of insulin, failure to eat adequately, or heavy physical activity. Signs of hypoglycemia often
develop rapidly. A hypoglycemic guest needs to get sugar into the bloodstream quickly to balance the effects of
a high insulin level.
Hyperglycemia occurs when the blood sugar level is too high, and the insulin level is too low. Unlike
hypoglycemia, with its rapid onset, hyperglycemia usually takes days to become a significant medical problem.

--- Page 166 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 154
Recognizing and Caring for Diabetic Emergencies
Signs of diabetic emergencies include:
• Diminished level of consciousness
• Weakness
• Hunger or thirst
• Vision difficulty
• Breathing difficulty
• Frequent urination
• Distinct fruity breath odor
If you are caring for a responsive diabetic, and you are
not sure if the guest is hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic,
give sugar. Glucose tablets or gel are often used by
Figure 14.9 Diabetics that are hypoglycemic need sugar.
diabetics for such an emergency (Figure 14.9). Other
items, such as a can of fruit juice, soda, packets of
sugar, or sugar candy can also be used. If hypoglycemia is present, and you have given sugar, the guest’s
condition often improves in a few minutes. In cases of hyperglycemia, the guest’s condition will remain
unchanged and the extra sugar will not be harmful. Call 9-1-1 for any unresponsive guest, or for any guest
whose condition does not rapidly improve.
Drug Emergencies
Drug emergencies result from the misuse or abuse of medical and non-medical substances. These may be legal
substances such as alcohol and pain killers, or illegal substances such as heroin and cocaine. Drug emergencies
result from various substances and are classified by the effects they have on the body.
Hallucinogens
Hallucinogens are substances that cause changes in self-awareness, perception, sensation and thought. They may
cause the guest to lose a sense of reality and have visual and auditory disturbances. Hallucinogens can be found
in some plants and mushrooms (or their extracts) or can be produced by humans. Hallucinogens include lysergic
acid diethylamide (LSD), phencyclidine (PCP), Peyote (mescaline), and “club drugs” such as MDMA (Ecstasy).
The signs of Hallucinogens include:
• Fear
• Panic
• Anxiety
• Tension
• Hallucinations
• Deep depression
• Feel of paranoia

--- Page 167 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 155
Depressants
Depressants are substances that depress the nervous system, causing sleepiness, muscle relaxation and
slowed breathing. Alcohol and sleep aids are commonly used depressants. Alcohol is the most commonly
abused drug in the United States. Binge drinking is a common cause of alcohol poisoning. According to the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC), more than 88,000 people die from alcohol-related deaths each year in the
United States. Those at highest risk of alcohol poisoning are college students, chronic alcoholics, those taking
medications that should not be combined with alcohol, and children curious about the effects.
The signs of alcohol intoxication include:
• The odor of alcohol
• Slurred, slow, or incomprehensible speech
• Confusion
• Dizziness or loss of consciousness
• Slowed actions
• Staggering gait or falling
• Nausea or vomiting
Stimulants
Stimulants are substances that increase mental and physical activity. Common products such as energy
drinks and power drinks contain stimulants that may have harmful effects. Cocaine, amphetamine, and
methamphetamine are commonly abused stimulants.
Signs of stimulant overdose includes:
• Flush skin
• Sweating
• Nausea
• Fever
• Rapid pulse
• High blood pressure
• Chest pain
Opioid (Narcotic) Painkillers
Opioids, also generally referred to as narcotics, are substances that are powerful depressants often used to
relieve pain. These substances include legally prescribed pain medications such as morphine, hydrocodone,
and oxycodone. These are often sold under brand names such as OxyContin®, Percocet®, Vicodin®, and
Demerol®. Heroin is an illegal opioid. Opioids depress the central nervous system resulting in loss of
consciousness and depressed or absent breathing.

--- Page 168 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 156
It is estimated that more than two million people in
the United States suffer from substance use disorders
related to prescription pain relievers. To counteract
this epidemic involving legal and illegal use of opioids,
efforts are underway to provide education to prevent
overdoses, and to train people in the use of the
medication naloxone to reverse opioid overdose.
The medication can be given through a muscle auto-
injector similar to one used to deliver epinephrine for
anaphylaxis, or through a nasal spray device (Figure
14-10). Most states have enacted laws making this
medication available without prescription. Figure 14.10 Naloxone can be given through a muscle
auto-injector or through a nasal spray device
General Care for Drug Emergencies
To care for drug emergencies:
• Ensure that the scene is safe
• For intoxication in a responsive, breathing guest, call the Poison Control Centers help line for advice
(800-222-1222)
• Calm and reassure the guest
• if the guest is preparing to sleep, have the guest sleep on his or her side, and stay with the guest. If the
guest becomes hostile and cannot be easily controlled, leave the guest and call 9-1-1
• If the guest is unresponsive, place the guest in the recovery position and call 9-1-1. If the guest is
unresponsive and not breathing, begin CPR
• If the guest is experiencing breathing difficulty provide supplemental oxygen support if available
Naloxone Auto-Injectors for Opioid Overdose
Naloxone is a medication administered to those
who overdose on opioids and are unresponsive and
not breathing adequately (very slow, gasping or no
breathing).
To use the nasal spray to assist a guest:
1. Position the guest face up
2. Insert the nozzle into a nostril and depress the
plunger with your thumb (Figure 14-11)
To use the muscle auto injector to assist a guest:
Figure 14.11 Insert the nozzle of the naloxone device into
1. Remove the safety guard
a nostril and depress the plunger.
2. Place the black side of the injector near the outer
thigh. Push firmly and hold in place for five seconds

--- Page 169 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 157
In all cases:
• Make sure your EAP has activated EMS
• Follow the instructions that come with the device for proper administration
• Follow local response protocols when required
• Provide basic life support care such as rescue breathing or CPR with supplemental oxygen support as needed
Fainting
Fainting (syncope) is a type of shock associated with a sudden, temporary loss of consciousness resulting from
reduced blood flow and oxygen to the brain. Guests who faint often regain consciousness quickly after lying
flat, which allows more blood and oxygen to return to the brain.
Causes of fainting can include:
• Exhaustion
• Hypoglycemia (low blood sugar)
• Heart problems
• Insufficient food or water
• Low blood pressure
• Blood loss
• Emotional upset
• Hyperventilation (rapid breathing)
• Standing too long in one place
• Psychological stress
Caring for Fainting
To care for fainting:
1. Position the guest on his/her back on a flat surface
2. Check responsiveness and breathing
3. Check for any signs of injury if the guest fell when fainting
4. If the guest vomits, roll the guest into the recovery position to keep the airway clear
5. Loosen any restrictive clothing
6. Maintain normal body temperature
7. Provide supplemental oxygen support if available
8. Call 9-1-1 if the guest does not quickly regain consciousness, has repeat fainting episodes, or if the guest
fainted for no apparent reason

--- Page 170 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 158
Heart Attack
A heart attack occurs when blood flow to a part of
the heart is disrupted due to a blockage of one or
more of the coronary arteries in the heart that supply
the heart’s oxygen needs. This lack of oxygen will
cause death to part of the heart muscle. Discomfort
often involves the chest, is persistent, not relieved
by rest, and may spread to the shoulders, neck, jaw,
or arms (Figure 14.12). Chest discomfort is often
Figure 14.12 Chest discomfort is a common sign of heart
accompanied by other signs, including:
attack.
• Breathing difficulty
• Sweating
• Nausea, or vomiting
• Dizziness
• Fatigue
Caring for Heart Attack
To care for a possible heart attack:
1. Call 9-1-1
2. Help the guest to rest in the most comfortable
position
Figure 14.13 Aspirin can be helpful for a guest
3. If the guest has prescribed heart medication,
experiencing a heart attack.
such as nitroglycerin, assist the guest with
its use
4. If the guest is not allergic to aspirin and is not taking
a blood thinner, provide one regular aspirin or two
low dose aspirins if available (Figure 14.13)
5. Provide supplemental oxygen support if having
rouble breathing
Heat Emergencies
Physical activity in a hot environment can lead to three types of heat emergencies:
• Heat cramps
• Heat exhaustion
• Heatstroke

--- Page 171 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 159
Recognizing and Caring for Heat Cramps
Heat cramps are the least serious of the three heat emergencies. Heat cramps are sudden, painful muscle
cramps most often occurring in calf or hamstring muscles of the legs.
To care for heat cramps:
1. Have the guest stop any strenuous activity
2. Stretch the affected muscle
3. Provide water or an electrolyte drink
Recognizing and Caring for Heat Exhaustion
Heat exhaustion is a warning that the body is getting too warm and its’ ability to cool itself is starting to fail.
This often results from loss of salt and water from heavy sweating,
The signs of heat exhaustion include:
• Heavy sweating
• Fatigue
• Thirst
• Weakness
• Dizziness
• Nausea and vomiting
• Headache
Care for heat exhaustion is aimed at cooling the body
and replacing lost water and electrolytes. Follow these
steps:
Figure 14.14 Cool the guest by applying water-soaked
1. Have the guest rest in a cool environment
towels.
2. Provide water or a commercial sports drink if
the guest is not nauseated
3. Cool the guest by applying water-soaked towels and a fan if available (Figure 14.14)
4. Call 9-1-1 if the guest’s condition is not improving
Recognizing and Caring for Heatstroke
Heatstroke occurs when the sweat mechanism of the body fails, and the body becomes dangerously
overheated. Heatstroke can occur quickly if working in a hot environment in heavy clothing, such as a
firefighter working in building fire. But it can also build up over time, as with elderly persons without air
conditioning during a prolonged dangerous heat wave.

--- Page 172 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 160
The signs of heatstroke include:
• Very high temperature (104oF or higher)
• Hot, flushed (red) skin
• Little or no sweating
• Confusion
• Seizures
• Loss of consciousness
• Cardiac arrest
To care for heatstroke:
1. Rapidly cool the guest by any means possible. This can include immersing the guest up to the neck in
cold water, such as in pool or applying cold packs to large blood vessels located at the sides of the neck,
armpits, and groin
2. Call 9-1-1
3. If the guest is unresponsive and not breathing (or only occasionally gasping), begin CPR. Provided
supplemental oxygen support if availble
Poisoning
Poisoning occurs when any substance interferes with normal body functions after it enters the body. A poison
can be ingested, inhaled, injected, or absorbed. Each year, approximately 10 million cases of poisoning occur in
the United States, most accidental, but some intentional. Most poisoning incidents involve children under five
years of age. The effects of poisons vary. They can interfere with metabolism, destroy organs such as the liver
or kidneys, and depress the nervous system, which can lead to loss of consciousness, breathing difficulty, and
cardiac arrest.
General Poison Care
The American Association of Poison Control Centers supports 55 Poison Control Centers in the United States.
These centers provide care advice for poisoning incidents and help reduce costly hospital visits through proper
in-home care. Poison centers offer free, confidential advice 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, through the Poison
Help line at 800-222-1222.
Call the Poison Help line if the guest is responsive and not experiencing breathing problems. Otherwise call 9-1-1.

--- Page 173 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 161
When you call the Poison Help line, be prepared to answer questions that include:
• What poison was the guest exposed to?
• How much poison was the guest exposed to?
• In what manner was the guest poisoned?
• What is the age and approximate weight of the guest?
• What care has been provided?
Recognizing and Caring for Ingested Poisons
Ingested poisons are the most common type of poisoning. Poisoning by ingestion occurs anytime a person
swallows a toxic substance.
Commonly ingested poisons include:
• Pain medications such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin)
• Home cleaning products such as dishwashing liquids and drain openers
• Personal care products such as hand sanitizer, shampoo, and nail polish
• Laundry detergents
• Pesticides
• Plants
• Alcohol and other drugs
The signs of ingested poisons can include:
• Nausea and vomiting
• Abdominal cramps and pain
• Burns of the moth, lips, tongue, and throat
• Diminished consciousness
• Seizures
For responsive guests without breathing problems, call the Poison Help line and follow the advice provided.
This might include diluting the ingested poison with milk or water or inducing vomiting. Acids, alkalis, alcohol,
and gasoline are examples of some products for which different care is needed. Call 9-1-1 if the guest is
unresponsive or having difficulty breathing.
Recognizing and Caring for Inhaled Poisons
Carbon monoxide is the most common form of inhaled poison. It is colorless and odorless, and produced by
the incomplete burning of wood, gasoline, charcoal, and natural gas.
Other toxic inhaled substances include:
• Insecticides
• Gasoline
• Paint thinner
• Insect repellent

--- Page 174 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 162
The signs associated with inhaled poisons include:
• Headache
• Dizziness
• Altered consciousness
• Breathing difficulty
To care for a guest who has inhaled a poison, get the guest out of any toxic environment if it is safe for you to
enter. Check responsiveness and breathing. Provide supplemental oxygen support if available. Provide CPR if
the guest is unresponsive and not breathing normally. Call 9-1-1.
Recognizing and Caring for Absorbed Poisons
Poisons that can be absorbed through the skin include
chemicals such as cleaning solutions like bleach, as
well as poisonous plants.
Poison ivy, oak, and sumac are the most common
types of poisonous plants, and often lead to allergic
reaction (Figure 14.15). The allergic reaction is caused
from the oily resin called urushiol in the leaves,
stems and roots of these plants. The reaction usually
develops one to two days after exposure and can last
for a few weeks. The severity of the rash depends on
the amount of urushiol that gets on the skin. Figure 14.15 Poison Ivy is one type of common poisonous
plant.
The signs of plant poisoning include:
• Dermatitis (swollen red skin with an itchy rash)
(Figure 14.16)
• Blisters
• Difficulty breathing, if burning poison ivy smoke
has been inhaled
Follow these steps to care for plant poisoning:
Upon initial contact with the plant:
1. Wash the affected area thoroughly with soap
and water
2. If available, apply a commercial product such as
CortaidTM, TechnuTM, or ZanfelTM Figure 14.16 Dermatitis caused by exposure to a
poisonous plant such as poison ivy.
If the dermatitis is already present:
1. Apply a corticosteroid cream, calamine lotion, or commercial product such as ZanfelTM
2. Use oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (BenadrylTM)

--- Page 175 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 163
3. Soak in a cool-water bath containing an oatmeal-based bath product (AveenoTM)
4. Place cool, wet compresses on the affected area for 15 to 30 minutes several times a day
5. Seek medical care if the dermatitis is widespread, affects areas such as face, neck, or genitals, or appears
to be infected
6. Corticosteroids such as prednisone, and/or antibiotics may be prescribed to reduce the swelling and
irritation
Chemical Poisons and Safety Data Sheets (SDS)
Employers are required by law to maintain a copy of Safety Data Sheets (SDS) that document the
presence of, and care for, any hazardous materials in the workplace. The Occupational Safety and Health
Administration’s (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard requires this information to be provided to you
along with training on handling any chemicals, and proper chemical safety labeling. Safety Data Sheets
contain helpful information about product identification, accidental release response measures, exposure
control, personal protection, and poisoning treatment.
Recognizing and Caring for Injected Poisons
Injected poisons can result from a toxic substance in a needle or as a result of bites or stings from:
• Insects
• Spiders
• Ticks
• Scorpions
• Marine life
• Snakes
• Animals
• Humans
Insect Bites and Stings
Insects that bite or sting include bees, wasps, hornets,
yellow jackets, mosquitos, and fire ants. Ticks and
spiders are arachnids that bite. Bees are the only
stinging insects that leave behind part of their bodies,
the venom sack, when they sting. Most of these bites
or stings occur outdoors during warm months. Bites
and stings often result in an envenomation mark,
swelling, and itching (Figure 14.17).
Figure 14.17 Envenomation mark, swelling, and rash
associated with bites and stings.

--- Page 176 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 164
To care for insect bites and stings:
1. For a bee sting, remove the stinger as quickly as possible. This can be done by scraping away the stinger
with a fingernail or edge of a plastic card or removing it with tweezers
2. Wash any affected area with soap and water
3. Apply a cold pack to reduce pain and swelling
4. Provide an over-the-counter pain reliever such as ibuprofen
5. Reduce itching and swelling by using hydrocortisone cream or an oral antihistamine
6. Monitor the guest for signs of any severe allergic reaction
7. Call 9-1-1 if anaphylaxis occurs and assist the guest with his/her prescribed epinephrine
auto-injector if available
Spider Bites
Most spider fangs are too small to penetrate human
skin, or their venom is not potent enough to cause
harm. But two spiders of concern in the United States
are the black widow and the brown spider, such as
the brown recluse (Figure 14.18). A guest bitten by
a black widow spider may feel a pinprick at the time
of the bite. Shortly after being bitten the guest will
feel a dull, numbing pain at the site of the bite. Small
fang marks may be noticeable. This is usually followed
by muscle cramps and severe pain, fever, chills,
Figure 14.18 Two spiders of concern in the United States
headache, dizziness, and nausea.
are the black widow and the brown recluse
A guest bitten by a brown recluse spider often does not feel the bite. Hours later, pain, swelling, itching, and redness
will develop at the site of the bite. A blister develops days later that takes weeks or months to heal.
To care for a black widow or brown recluse spider bite:
1. Wash the site with soap and water and clean it further with an alcohol swab
2. Apply ice to control swelling and provide some relief from the pain
3. Provide an over-the-counter pain medication
4. Call 9-1-1
Tick Bites
Ticks carry diseases such as Lyme disease, Rocky
Mountain spotted fever, and tick paralysis. Because
tick bites can go unrecognized for days, the chance of
transmitting a disease is increased. The signs of tick
bite can include swelling and a rash. Sometimes the
tick can be embedded in the skin (Figure 14.19).
Figure 14.19 Embedded tick and rash.

--- Page 177 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 165
To care for an embedded tick:
1. Grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible with tweezers. Lift gently and hold with the skin tented until
the tick releases
2. Wash the area with soap and water and disinfect the site with alcohol
3. Apply an ice pack for any swelling or pain
4. Apply hydrocortisone cream for any itching
5. Advise the guest to watch for rashes, flu-like signs, or joint discomfort over the next 30 days. Seek medical
care if these signs occur. Treatment for tick diseases involves prescribed antibiotics
Scorpion Stings
Scorpions are closely related to spiders and ticks. The scorpion’s tail contains the stinger that injects a toxin.
Though most scorpions in the United States are harmless, the bark scorpion found in the southwest is
dangerous. Scorpion stings can be painful, but rarely fatal.
To care for a scorpion sting:
1. Wash the site with soap and water
2. Apply a cold pack
3. Seek medical care
Human Bites
Human bites can deliver high levels of bacteria and different types of viruses contained in human mouths. A minor
wound from a human bite can become infected and can sometimes be difficult to treat due to complications.
To care for human bites:
1. Clean a minor wound with soap and water, apply antibiotic ointment, and cover the wound with a clean
dressing
2. If the area is bleeding heavily, apply direct pressure with a clean dressing until the bleeding is controlled
3. Seek medical attention for any deep bites
Animal Bites
Most animal bites are from domestic dogs and cats that produce puncture and crushing-type wounds. Rabies is a
virus transmitted from the saliva of an infected animal through a bite or scrape. The rabies virus infects the central
nervous system, ultimately causing disease in the brain and death. Most rabies cases occur in wild animals like
raccoons, skunks, bats, and foxes. Domestic animals are usually infected by wild animals when the domestic pets
are not vaccinated against rabies. Human rabies cases in the United States are very rare. In unvaccinated humans,
rabies is almost always fatal after serious signs have developed. Vaccination after exposure is highly successful in
preventing the disease if administered within a few days of infection. Care for animal bites is the same as for human
bites. Seek medical assistance for any serious wounds from any animal that could be rabid. Report bites to local law
enforcement personnel.

--- Page 178 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 166
Marine Animal Bites, Stings, and Punctures
Marine animals can cause sting, bite, and puncture
injuries. Jellyfish and Portuguese men-of-war account
for the greatest number of injuries each year (Figure
14.20). The signs of stinging marine animals include
redness, swelling, and burning pain. In some cases,
more severe allergic reactions can occur. Most stings
can be treated by rinsing the area initially with sea
water, carefully removing any remaining tentacles,
applying vinegar, and taking a pain reliever. Call
9-1-1 at the first signs of anaphylaxis. Stingrays
are marine animals that often bury themselves in Figure 14.20 The tentacles of a jellyfish can deliver a
sand. Unsuspecting guests accidently step on them, powerful sting.
resulting in a laceration, puncture or impaled object
wound as the stingray flicks its barbed tail. Most
wounds are inflicted to the feet and anklesof guests.
To care for injuries caused by stingrays:
1. Flush the injured area to help remove any debris
2. Immerse the injured part in hot water to neutralize the venom and reduce pain
3. Seek medical care. The wound of a stingray can have pieces of barb and become infected. The wound may
also need sutures
Injuries from sharks, barracudas, and eels are rare, but when they occur the bite can cause lacerations or
punctures. Control bleeding, care for shock, and call 9-1-1.
Snakebites
There are 4 venomous snakes in the United States
(Figure 14.21):
• Rattlesnake
• Copperhead
• Water moccasin
• Coral snake
The first three snakes are pit vipers, getting their
name from the pit between their eyes and nostrils Figure 14.21 A rattlesnake is one of the four venomous
that acts as a heat seeking system. They inject their snakes found in the United States.

--- Page 179 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 167
venom through two fangs (Figure 14.22). The coral
snake is not a pit viper and does not have large fangs.
The bite of these snakes can cause severe burning,
pain, and swelling, and blood-filled blisters.
To care for these venomous snakebites:
1. Get the guest away from the snake. Do not try to
capture or kill the snake
2. Limit movement of the guest
3. Wash the wound and cover with a clean dressing.
4. Immobilize any bitten limb
5. Apply an elastic bandage over an affected limb to Figure 14.22 Pit viper bite.
help slow the spread of the venom
6. Call 9-1-1
Pregnancy Complications
While most pregnancies occur without complications, some unforeseen problems can arise. Some problems
during pregnancy are minor and expected, while others are more serious.
Pregnancy complications requiring medical care include guests experiencing:
• Severe abdominal pain or cramps
• Heavy vaginal bleeding
• Severe nausea and vomiting
• Significant decline in the activity of the baby
• Persistent, severe headache
• Visual disturbances
Pregnancy complications require the attention of medical professionals. Call 9-1-1. For vaginal bleeding or severe
abdominal pain or cramps, place the guest on her left side. If vaginal bleeding is present, have the guest place a
sanitary napkin or other sterile dressing over the opening of the vagina. Do not discard any blood-soaked dressings or
tissue that is passed. Save these for EMS personnel to take
with the guest to the hospital for further evaluation.
Seizure
A Seizure is uncontrolled electrical activity in the brain,
which may produce convulsions (shaking), muscle rigidity,
altered levels of consciousness, or thought disturbances
(Figure 14.23). The type of seizure and the signs that
are exhibited depend on where the abnormal electrical
activity takes place in the brain, its cause, and factors such
as a guest’s general state of health. Figure 14.23 Seizure.

--- Page 180 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 168
A seizure can be caused by head injury, brain tumor, hypoglycemia, drug overdose, poisoning, infectious
illnesses, and fever. A guest may have early warning signs (aura) of an impending event.
To care for seizures:
1. Protect the guest from injury by moving any items away that might cause harm, such as sharp objects
2. Roll the guest onto one side (recovery position) to help keep the airway clear
3. Protect the head from injury if convulsions are present by placing a soft object, such as a folded towel,
under the guest’s head
4. Call 9-1-1
5. Provide supplemental oxygen support if available
Stroke
Brain Stroke
A stroke occurs when blood flow to a part of the Ischemic Stroke Hemorrhagic Stroke
brain is disrupted due to blocked or ruptured
arteries in the brain (Figure 14.24). Signs of stroke
include weakness or numbness on one side of the
body, vision problems, problems speaking, dizziness
or loss of balance, confusion, and sudden severe
headache.
Use the FAST protocol to help recognize the need to
get care to a guest experiencing a stroke:
F = Facial droop. Ask the guest to smile and see
if one side of the face is drooping (Figure
Blockage of blood vessels; lack of blood flow to Rupture of blood vessels; leakage of blood

A = Arm weakness. Ask the guest to raise both Figure 14.24 There are two forms of stroke.
arms
S = Speech difficulty. Listen to the guest speaking
T = Time to call 9-1-1
To care for a guest with a possible stroke:
• Call 9-1-1
• Have the guest rest in the most comfortable
position. This position is often lying on the back
with head and shoulders elevated
• If vomiting occurs, roll the guest onto his/her
side (recovery position) to keep the airway clear

FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
Medical emergencies may occur at any time and for many reasons. It is important that you recognize signs of
common emergencies and provide the necessary care, including summoning EMS professionals when necessary
The signs of allergic reactions often appear shortly after an exposure to an allergen. The most serious is
anaphylaxis, a type of shock. For severe allergic reactions, call 9-1-1, and assist the guest with an epinephrine
auto-injector if the guest has one available.
The signs of breathing problems include breathing that is excessively fast, slow, or noisy. Asthma is a breathing
problem that afflicts millions of people. Care for an asthma attack by having the guest use his or her inhaler
whenever available. Provide supplemental oxygen support, if available, for guests experiencing breathing
difficulty and monitor the guest’s condition until EMS personnel arrive.
There are two types of cold emergencies. Hypothermia is a condition of abnormally low body temperature.
Warm the guest gradually, replacing any wet clothing. Call 9-1-1 if the guest’s condition doesn’t improve.
Frostbite involves the freezing of body parts. Get to a warmer area. Call 9-1-1.
There are two types of diabetic emergencies, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), and hyperglycemia (high blood
sugar). Care for diabetic conditions by providing sugar. Call 9-1-1 if the guest’s condition does not improve in a
few minutes.
If a guest is suffering from a drug overdose, call 9-1-1. If the drug is an opioid, administer naloxone if it is
available and you are trained to do so.
Fainting is a form of shock associated with a sudden, temporary loss of consciousness as a result of reduced
blood flow and oxygen to the brain. There are several causes of fainting, but the care is the same. Position the
guest on his or her back and call 9-1-1 if the condition does now quickly resolve itself.
Chest discomfort unrelieved by rest is a common sign of heart attack. Call 9-1-1. Administer aspirin if the guest
is not allergic. Provide supplemental oxygen support if available.
Provide rapid cooling to a guest that is experiencing a serious heat emergency such as heat exhaustion or
heatstroke. Call 9-1-1 if the condition does not rapidly improve.
Ingested poisons are the most common type of poisoning. Poisoning by ingestion occurs anytime a person
swallows a toxic substance. For responsive guests without breathing problems, call the Poison Help line and
follow the advice provided. Call 9-1-1 if the guest is unresponsive or having difficulty breathing.

--- Page 185 Text ---
Caring For Sudden Illnesses 173
Some problems during pregnancy are minor and expected, but others require advanced medical care such as
abdominal pain and heavy vaginal bleeding.
To care for marine stings such as that from a stingray, flush the injured area, and immerse the injured part
in hot water, and seek medical care. Injuries from marine animals such as sharks, barracudas, can result in
lacerations or punctures. Control bleeding, care for shock, and call 9-1-1.
There are different types and causes of seizures, but the care is generally the same. Keep the guest safe from
injury, keep the airway clear, and call 9-1-1.
Use the FAST mnemonic to recognize stroke. Call 9-1-1 and have the guest rest in the most comfortable
position until EMS professionals arrive.

Water Rescues For Responsive Guests 175
Introduction
An active guest in distress may remain conscious for only a short period of time. It is critical that you recognize
the event and respond promptly. You must quickly assess the situation and perform the appropriate rescue.
Once you have rescued the guest, move the guest to the closest safe point, provide any additional care and
document the incident.
The skills presented in this chapter will provide you with the necessary tools to safely provide rescues in a
variety of aquatic environments.
Assists
Sometimes you can help an active guest in distress without entering the water, while still maintaining your
10/20 Protection Standard. This is known as providing an assist.
There are various situations in which you might be required to provide an assist to guests:
• Help guests exit an attraction
• Aid small children who need help standing or reaching the attraction’s edge
• Assist weak swimmers who are being pulled backwards while trying to swim out of a current
• Support guests who lose their footing in an attraction
• Help guests who are disoriented when exiting a water slide
• Aid physically disabled or elderly guests needing assistance
When conducting an assist, you do not necessarily have to activate your emergency action plan (EAP) or
complete a rescue report because you are not leaving your zone unattended. However, if you’re attempting
to assist the guest and are unable to maintain the 10/20 Protection Standard, you must activate the EAP and
make a rescue.
Extension Assists
Extension assists can be performed from the deck if the guest in the water is within reach. Extend your rescue
tube to the guest and pull the guest to safety. If a rescue tube is not available, reach out and grasp the guest’s
arm and pull the guest to safety.
To perform an arm extension assist:
1. Lay flat on the deck near the edge
2. Extend your hand and grasp the guest’s arm or wrist
3. Pull the guest to safety
4. Assist the guest out of the water if needed

needed
Water Entries
A rescue is when you must enter the water, leaving
Figure 15.1 The rescue tube can be extended from the
your zone unprotected, to help a guest in distress.
deck to a guest in distress.
When entering the water, your personal safety is just
as important as the safety of your guest in distress.
Choose a safe entry approach that is appropriate for the
situation. The three most common types of safe entries
are:
• Compact jump entry (Entry from the pool deck or
elevated chair)
• High step entry (Entry from a zero-depth area into
waves or deeper water)
• Ease-in entry (Entry if a guest with suspected
spinal injury is near you)
The Compact Jump
Of the three types of entries, the compact jump entry
is the most common entry. The compact jump entry
is designed to be used in various depths of water and
from various heights into the water.
Figure 15.2 Hold the tube securely along with any excess
line as you prepare to do a compact jump. Jump into the

2. Hold the rescue tube against your chest with the

3. Jump into the water with your legs together,
knees bent, and feet flat (if you submerge, the
buoyancy of the tube will bring you quickly to the
surface)
4. Approach the guest

Water Rescues For Responsive Guests 177
High Step Entry
If you are working in a zero-depth entry area, such as
a wave pool or beach, enter the water using the high
step entry to help navigate any waves, speeding your
access to the guest in distress (Figure 15.3).
Carry the rescue tube beside you and run into the
shallow water with high steps so that you can step
over waves as they are rolling past you. After you reach
a water depth that slows you down (e.g. above your
knees), release the rescue tube and let it trail behind
you as you begin your approach swim. Figure 15.3 Use a high step entry when entering sloped
areas such as wave pools and beaches.
Ease-In Entry
The ease-in entry is used to enter shallow water or when
a nearby guest has a suspected spinal injury. Climbing or
sliding down a ladder or pool wall into the water causes
little water movement (Figure 15.4) and can help to prevent
further harm to a guest with suspected spinal injury.
Approach Strokes
After safely entering the water, your objective is to reach
the distressed guest as quickly as possible. With the
Figure 15.4 Use the ease-in entry if you suspect a nearby
rescue tube under your arms, swim towards the guest in
distress. This can be done by modifying the breaststroke guest has a possible spinal injury.
or front crawl stroke so that your head remains out of
the water allowing you to see the guest during your
approach (Figure 15.5).
In open-water situations, where the distance to the guest
may be greater than in a pool, use the front crawl stroke with
the rescue tube trailing behind you. When you get close to
the distressed guest, slow down and place the rescue tube in
front of you and finish your approach. This will put you in the
correct position to perform the water rescue.
As you near the guest, communicate clearly with simple
instructions, such as “Grab the tube.” A guest in distress
may change position as you approach. A guest on
the surface may slip below the surface requiring a

General Water Rescue Procedures
There are 10 general steps to follow when making a rescue:
1. Activate your EAP by blowing your whistle and pointing in the direction of the guest in
distress. This alerts others there is an emergency in the water and that your zone will need to
be covered as required by your facility specific zone plan
2. Depress the emergency stop (E-Stop) button if your duty station has one to stop operation of
the attraction such as waves at a wave pool
3. Enter the water safely
4. Quickly approach the guest
5. Perform the appropriate rescue
6. Move the guest to safety while providing any necessary care
7. Remove the guest from the water
8. Provide any additional emergency care needed
9. Complete a rescue report
10. Release the guest, or transfer the guest to EMS personnel.
When making a rescue, you must also quickly determine some critical information before you reach the guest:
• Does the guest appear to be active (responsive) or passive (unresponsive)
• What is the fastest way to get to the guest
• How do you safely enter the water
• What rescue technique will you need to use
• How many guests are involved
• Is it likely that assistance from other lifeguards may be needed
The 5 R’s of a Response
• Rescue. Rescue the guest in distress by using one of several techniques that enable the guest’s face
to be above the surface of the water
• Removal. Remove (extricate) the guest in distress from the water. Move the guest to the nearest
safe area to exit the water. This might be as simple as helping a guest walk out of the water. The
assistance of other lifeguards may be required if equipment such as a backboard is needed
• Render aid: Render any additional care when necessary. This could include helping calm a guest
who is distraught over the need to be rescued. It could be more complex, including performing CPR
or rescue breathing for an unresponsive guest
• Report: Complete a rescue report. If you provided additional care such as first aid, you may need
to complete a separate incident form as well. Documenting rescues serves as legal supportive data
and tracks statistical trends for your facility to evaluate.
• Release: Once the incident is documented, the guest can be released. Depending on the situation,
you may release the guest to a higher trained healthcare personnel, another lifeguard, a supervisor,
or an adult supervising the guest. Document when and to whom you released the guest.

Responsive Guests Beneath The Surface
Sometimes a guest in distress is responsive but is beneath the surface of the water. The guest may be within arm’s
reach from the surface, or deeper under the water requiring you to submerge to perform the rescue.
The Duck Pluck Rescue
The duck pluck rescue can be used when a responsive
guest of any size is beneath the surface of the water
but within arm’s reach. Follow these steps when using
this rescue:
1. Once you are above the submerged guest, hold
the center of your rescue tube with one hand
and reach over the tube with your other hand

Challenging Rescue Situations
Guests can be unpredictable. A guest in distress is often frightened or disoriented and might not behave as
you might expect as you make your approach. A guest may panic and try to grab you. Fortunately, you have a
rescue tube capable of supporting the weight of several people. Try to calm the guest. But if the guest is too
aggressive, your safety comes first, and you need to adjust to the situation.
Aggressive Guests
If you are unable to control an aggressive responsive guest, separate from the guest momentarily. The push
away technique is an effective means of moving away from a guest briefly so that you can attempt another
rescue or seek assistance from other lifeguards. Follow these steps to o perform the push-away technique
when a guest is forcing you under water:
1. Take in a breath, tuck your chin and submerge.
2. Push yourself down and away from the guest.
3. Resurface a few feet out of reach.
4. Recover your rescue tube if the guest is not holding it.
5. Signal for help from another lifeguard if needed.
6. Re-attempt your rescue.
Multiple Responsive Guests in Distress
When multiple guests are in distress at the same time,
you may need help from another lifeguard. Follow
these steps to handle this special situation:
1. Sometimes two guests in distress can be
rescued at the same time. For example, if one
small child has grasped another, you may be able
to use the rescue tube to support both guests.
Calm the guests and move to safety.
2. If this is not the case and you need help, raise
a clinched fist above your head to notify other
lifeguards (Figure 15.17).
3. Rescue one guest and move the guest to safety.
Figure 15.17 Raising a clinched fist overhead notifies other

signal will rescue the second guest and move the
guest to safety. If you are in a facility where you
are the only lifeguard, you will need to rescue
the second guest.

Two - Lifeguard Rescue
If a guest in distress is too difficult for you to rescue
due to the guest’s large size or aggressive behavior,
and you are in a multi-lifeguard facility, you can
perform a two-lifeguard rescue. In this situation,
lifeguards approach the guest from the front and
back and simultaneously execute a front drive and
rear hug front drive and rear hug (Figure 15.18,
Figure 15.19). Instead of grasping the guest’s chest

grasps the rescue tube that has been extended into
the guest’s chest. This enables the two lifeguards to
lock the guest between two rescue tubes providing
significant support. Calm the guest while moving
the guest to safety.

FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
You can use assist instead of a rescue to help a guest in distress if you can maintain the 10/20 Protection
Standard. If you cannot maintain this standard when performing a rescue, you must activate your EAP to notify
others that your zone is unprotected.
There are several different methods for entering the water safely and efficiently including the compact jump, high
step entry, and ease-in entry. Use a high step entry when entering sloped areas such as wave pools and beaches.
When a responsive guest is in distress on the surface of the water, you have several rescue options based on
the size, location, and position of the guest. These options include the grab and lift rescue, front drive rescue,
and front or rear hug rescues.
If a responsive guest in distress is below the surface but within your arm’s reach, you can use the duck pluck
rescue. If a guest is beyond your reach from the surface, perform the deep-water submerged rescue to bring
the guest to the surface and render aid.
As a lifeguard, your main objective is to get the guest’s head above water so that the guest can breathe. Calm the
guest while moving to safety. Render any additional care required, document the incident and release the guest.
If you find yourself in trouble while making a rescue, use the push away technique and then reattempt the
rescue. When multiple guests are in distress at the same time, you may need help from another lifeguard using
the two-lifeguard rescue. Be sure to signal for help from another lifeguard for rescue situations with multiple
guests or if a guest is too large or too aggressive. If you are in a single lifeguard facility, you will need to make
the second rescue.

Water Rescue For Unresponsive Guests 187
Unresponsive Guest In Distress
An unresponsive (unconscious) guest in the water is one who is passively drowning. The guest is generally face
down in the water. Sometimes, the unresponsive guest is floating on or near the surface of the water. An
unresponsive guest can be found in any depth of water:
• On the surface
• Below the surface within arm’s reach
• Below the surface beyond arm’s reach
An unresponsive guest can also be in flotation devices
such as lifejackets and inner tubes. An unresponsive
guest below the surface may be difficult to recognize
due to water turbidity (cloudiness) and clarity issues.
The guest may appear as a dark shadow, object, or spot
on the bottom (Figure 16.1). Anything that appears
abnormal requires you to investigate the situation
immediately. Activate your EAP, enter the water, and
Figure 16.1 An unresponsive guest below the surface may

appear as a shadow or blurry spot.
Unresponsive Guest Rescues
Your priorities with an unresponsive guest in the water are to:
• Get the guest’s face out of the water
• Open the guest’s airway to facilitate spontaneous breathing
• Provide in-water rescue breathing care if necessary
• Move the guest to the closest point to rapidly extricate the guest from the water
There are 3 different rescues that can be used for an unresponsive guest, based on where the guest is found in
the water:
• Surface ─ Rear hug rescue for an unresponsive guest
• Submerged within arm’s reach ─ Duck puck rescue for an unresponsive huest
• Submerged beyond arm’s reach ─ Deep water submerged rescue for an unresponsive guest
These rescues are similar to those you previously learned for responsive guests. The modifications involve the
placement of the rescue tube.

Caring For An
Unresponsive
Guest In The Water
You will need to act quickly to determine if the guest is
breathing, provide in-water care, and rapidly extricate
the guest from the water so that further, more
advanced care can be provided.
In-Water Rescue Breathing
Figure 16.10 Open the guest’s airway using a jaw thrust
with head-tilt and check for breathing.
To provide in-water rescue breathing for an
unresponsive guest, position the guest face up on the
rescue tube and follow these steps:
• Open the guest’s airway using a jaw thrust with
head-tilt and check for signs of normal breathing.
This may be all that is needed to start the guest
breathing (Figure 16.10)
• If the guest is not breathing, apply your
resuscitation mask and begin rescue breathing by
giving 2 initial ventilations. (Figure 16.11)
• If the guest does not respond to these
ventilations, continue rescue breathing (1 breath

• Remove the guest from the water as soon as
possible so that better care can be provided on land
If an unresponsive infant is rescued in the water, in-
water care may not be practical. The objective with
any unresponsive guest is to open the airway as soon
as possible. Rapidly move the infant to the nearest exit
point and begin care on land.

Rapid Extrication Of An Unresponsive
Guest
Rapid extrication is a technique used to quickly
and safely remove an unresponsive guest from the
water. The technique requires multiple lifeguards or
supplemental responders and a backboard. There are
two methods of rapid extrication:
• Carry-out technique
• Pool edge technique

backboard to rapidly remove an unresponsive guest
from the water with a zero-depth entry area such as a
beach or wave pool. There are several versions of this
technique based on the number of responders available
to assist. Your facility is responsible for the extrication
EAP you will use. To complete the carry-out technique
for rapid extrication, perform the following steps:
1. As the primary lifeguard moves with the guest
toward the extrication point, at least one other
lifeguard enters the water with a backboard
(Figure 16.13)
2. Submerge and position the backboard under the Figure 16.14 Position the backboard under the guest and

rises against the guest’s back (Figure 16.14)
3. If the distance to the zero-depth area is short and
the guest is small, grasp the handholds under
the guest’s armpits and drag the guest onto land
(Figure 16.15)
4. If the distance to land is greater, the guest is
large, or you have steps to navigate that require
lifting and carrying the guest on the backboard,
secure a chest strap for additional support
5. Move the guest at least six feet from the water’s
edge, lower the backboard, and begin on-land
care Figure 16.15 Grasp the handholds under the guest’s
armpits and drag the guest onto land.

Rapid Extrication: Pool Edge
Technique
The pool edge technique for extrication requires a
backboard and at least one other responder. The rapid
extrication is used in facilities with a perimeter edge
or gutter near the water line. Follow these steps when
using this technique:
1. As the primary lifeguard moves with the guest
toward the extrication point, the lifeguard on-
deck positions the backboard vertically in the

holding the backboard in position with the other
hand (Figure 16.17)
3. The primary lifeguard removes the rescue tube.
With the guest centered on the backboard, the
two lifeguards communicate their readiness to
remove the guest from the water (Figure 16.18)
4. The on-deck lifeguard pulls the backboard while
supporting the guest’s arm. At the same time, the
primary lifeguard pushes the backboard onto the
deck. The backboard will move smoothly along the
edge as the lifeguards work together (Figure 16.19)
5. Once out of the water, the lifeguards work

Care After Extrication
Once the unresponsive guest is removed from the water, follow these steps for care:
1. Assess the presence of breathing and pulse for up to 10 seconds (Figure 16.20)
2. If the guest has a pulse but is not showing signs of normal breathing, begin rescue breathing using a
resuscitation mask or a bag-valve-mask (BVM) attached to supplemental oxygen
(Figure 16.21)
3. If there is no pulse detected or if there is any uncertainty about a pulse, begin cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR), incorporating an automated external defibrillator (AED), when it is ready (Figure
16.22)
4. If the guest begins to vomit, place the guest in the recovery (side) position

• Once care has begun, pauses in continuous care
must be kept to a minimum
• Utilize appropriate PPE when confronted with body substances
• Include supplemental oxygen during all resuscitation efforts
• As these become available, apply the best equipment options without interrupting care
• Use good teamwork, clear communication, and anticipatory problem solving
Supplemental Responders
Supplemental responders are those designated and properly trained to assist lifeguards in an
emergency when there are not enough lifeguards available to perform to the standard of care the
situation requires. Supplemental responder procedures should be documented in your facility’s
Emergency Action Plan (EAP). If you are working in a single lifeguard facility where your EAP requires
you to work with supplemental responders, you should practice with these responders so that you are
able to work together to extricate a guest from the water and provide additional care as part of a team.

Water Rescue For Unresponsive Guests 196
FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
An unresponsive guest in distress may be located on the surface, below the surface within arm’s reach, or
submerged beyond arm’s reach.
An unresponsive guest below the surface may be difficult to recognize due to water turbidity and glare and
may appear as a shadow, object, or spot on the bottom of the water. If you are unsure of what you are seeing,
treat it as an emergency. Activate your EAP and respond immediately.
There are three types of rescues used to respond to unresponsive guests. These are rescues you previously
learned but with some modifications due to the unresponsive condition of the guest. The rescues are the rear
hug, duck pluck, and submerged deep-water rescue.
When delivering rescue breathing in the water, place the unresponsive guest face up on the rescue tube
and quickly check for breathing. If the guest is not breathing, provide rescue breathing by giving 2 initial
ventilations. If there is no response, give 1 ventilation every 5 seconds for an adult or every 3 seconds for a
child, while quickly moving the unresponsive guest to an extrication point. If the unresponsive guest is an
infant, quickly remove the infant from the water, open the airway, and provide care.
The carry - out technique and the pool edge technique are options used for rapid extrication. Both require the
use of a backboard. Rapid extrications are completed by multiple lifeguards.
When extricated from the water, the guest should be placed at least six (6) feet from the water’s edge for
safety to begin on-land care. Assess breathing and pulse. If the guest is unresponsive, not breathing, and
pulseless, begin CPR until an AED is available. If the unresponsive guest is not breathing but does have a pulse,
provide rescue breathing.
If the distressed guest shows signs of life or begins to vomit, place the guest in the recovery (side) position.

About The Spine
The spine is made up of 33 vertebrae that form the
spinal column, extending from the base of the skull to
the tip of the tailbone. The vertebrae are separated by
cushions of cartilage called discs. Within the center of
the spinal column is a bundle of nerves that comprises
the spinal cord (Figure 17.1). The spine is divided into
several regions:
• Neck (Cervical)
• Middle back (Thoracic)
• Lower back (Lumbar)
• Pelvis (Sacral)
Figure 17.1 The vertebrae of the spine.
• Tailbone (Coccyx)
Injury to the spine can damage the vertebrae, discs, or nerves. The most common aquatic spinal injuries
involve injury to the neck from impact with a structure such as diving board, slide, or surface sides or bottom.
Recognizing Spinal Injuries
The cause, also known as the mechanism of injury (MOI), is used to consider the potential for spinal injury.
For example, seeing or hearing a firsthand account of a guest entering shallow water head first and striking the
bottom indicates the potential for spinal injury. But this is only one item to consider. If the guest is responsive,
ask about pain and the ability to move body parts normally. Look for signs of spinal injury. Your observations
and questioning provide guidance when deciding how to proceed with these types of potential spinal injuries.
Signs of Spinal Injury
Most spinal injuries that occur in the water involve
conscious, breathing guests. Guests suffering from a
spinal injury may exhibit one or more of these signs
(Figure 17.2):
• Neck or back pain that is made worse by
movement
• Numbness, tingling, burning, weakness, or
inability to move limbs, neck, or back normally
• Deformity of the neck
• Altered level of consciousness
• Bruising of the head, neck, or back
Figure 17.2 You need to recognize the mechanism (cause)
• Blood or bloody fluid in the ears or nose
and signs of spinal injury.

Suspected Spinal Injury 199
Areas where spinal injuries are likely to occur include:
• Shallow depth areas
• Water slides
• Diving board areas
• Surf & stand up paddle board areas
• Watercraft sport areas
Possible Causes of Spinal Injury
The following high impact/high risk activities could result in spinal injury:
• Head-first entry into shallow water
• Colliding with another guest, pool or attraction walls, submerged object, or bottom
• Receiving a significant blow to the head, neck or back
• Entering the water from an elevated height, such as a high diving board
• Striking the water’s surface at high speed from a water craft or surf board
Caring For Spinal Injuries In The Water
If you suspect a guest has suffered a spinal injury in the water, care for the injury by minimizing movement of
the guest’s head, neck and back. This is known as Spinal Motion Restriction (SMR). Your initial SMR involves
holding the guest in a position that keeps the guest’s head in-line with the body. When additional lifeguards
arrive, SMR is continued by securing the guest to a backboard for removal from the water.
The specific care you provide for a guest with suspected spinal injury will depend on:
• The guest’s condition, including whether the guest is responsive and breathing. If the guest stops
breathing while in the water, follow your procedures for rapid extrication. Care priority is given to
breathing over spinal care
• The location of the guest (on the surface or submerged, in shallow or deep water, in a slide, or on land)
• The availability of other lifeguards or responders,
and EMS personnel
• Your facility’s specific procedures based on the
attractions
Water Entry and Approach
Enter the water in a manner that will not cause
further movement to the guest. Use an ease-in entry
to approach a nearby guest with suspected spinal
injury. This technique minimizes water movement

Suspected Spinal Injury 200
Vise Grip Technique
The vise grip technique is the spinal motion restriction (SMR) maneuver used when you reach the guest. It
involves positioning the guest’s arms alongside the head and holding the arms firmly to keep the head in-line
with the body. The vise grip can be used for:
• Responsive or unresponsive guests
• Guests found face up or face down
• Guests on the surface or submerged in any depth water
Vise Grip: Guest in Shallow Water
If you are in water that is waist deep or less, you can release your rescue tube as you reach the guest and
prepare to apply SMR.
Follow these steps to perform the underarm vise grip
for a guest found face up in shallow water:
1. Position yourself near the guest’s head
2. Grasp the guest’s upper arms. Hold the guest’s
right arm with your right hand and left arm with
your left hand
3. Place the guest on the back and slowly move the
arms alongside the guest’s head
4. Press the arms firmly against the guest’s ears to
hold the head in-line with the body (Figure 17.4)
5. Lower yourself in the water and check

roll the guest face up so that the guest can breathe.
This is done while maintaining SMR. Follow these steps
to perform the underarm vise grip for a guest found
face down in shallow water:
1. Position yourself near the guest’s head
2. Grasp the guest’s upper arms. Hold the guest’s
right arm with your right hand and left arm with
your left hand
3. Slowly move the arms alongside the guest’s head
4. Press the arms firmly against the guest’s ears to
hold the head in-line with the body (Figure 17.5)
Figure 17.5 For a face down guest begin by pressing the
arms firmly against the guest’s ears.

Vise Grip: Guest on the
Surface in Deep Water
The underarm vise grip technique used in shallow
water is also used in deep water. The only difference
is that you will keep the rescue tube under your arms Figure 17.6 Move forward and slowly roll the guest face

(Figure 17.7). Follow these guidelines to care for a
guest with a possible spinal injury on the surface in
deep water:
• Approach the guest with the rescue tube under
your arms
• If the guest is face up, use the underarm vise grip
technique
• If the guest is face down, roll the guest face up
into the underarm vise grip
• Check responsiveness and breathing
Figure 17.7 Use the rescue tube for support while caring
Vise Grip: Submerged Guest
for a guest on the surface in deep water.
Spinal injuries involving submerged guests are rare.
When a guest has a spinal injury and is submerged
but within reach from the surface, you can use the
vise grip to provide SMR. In these situations, you may
be able to keep the rescue tube under your arms to
support yourself as you apply the vise grip technique.
If the guest is submerged beyond your reach you
will need to submerge without your rescue tube and
bring the guest to the surface while maintaining SMR.
Follow these steps to perform the underarm vise grip

Overarm Vise Grip
Before a guest can be removed from the water the
guest must be placed on a backboard. To accomplish
this skill, you must switch from the underarm vise grip
to the overarm vise grip. This technique will enable
you to remove your arm from beneath the guest
without disrupting SMR. Then the guest can be placed
on the backboard. To switch to the overarm vise grip,
follow these steps:
1. Hold the guest firmly against your chest with the
Figure 17.13 Using an underam vise grip, pull the guest
hand that is furthest away from you
firmly against your chest.
(Figure 17.13)
2. Release the grip of the hand that is closest to
your chest, reach across the guest’s chest and
grasp the guest’s arm furthest from you
(Figure 17.14)
3. Remove your hand that is under the guest and
move it to the arm that is against your chest
(Figure 17.15)
4. Continue squeezing the guest’s arms to
maintain SMR

Suspected Spinal Injury 204
Backboarding And Extrication
A guest with a possible spinal injury in the water will
need to be removed carefully to avoid the possibility of
further injury. This process is known as backboarding,
and it requires the use of a board, straps, and head
immobilizer to secure the guest to the board prior to
removal from the water (Figure 17.16). There are three
methods used to backboard a guest depending on the
guest’s location in the attraction and the number of
responders available to help:
• Pool edge backboarding
• Team carry out backboarding
• Slide run-out / zero-depth area backboarding Figure 17.16 16 Backboard, straps, and head immobilizer.
Lifeguards need to communicate with each other
during backboarding to ensure the guest’s safety.
Pool Edge Backboarding
A minimum of two lifeguards can maintain SMR and
use a backboard to remove a guest at the pool edge
by following these steps:
1. The primary lifeguard maintains the overarm
vise grip as the second lifeguard positions the
backboard in the water. The lifeguards work to
safely slide the guest onto the backboard
(Figure 17.17) Figure 17.17 Work as a team to slide the guest onto the

Suspected Spinal Injury 205
3. The primary lifeguard uses straps to secure the guest to the backboard in this order (Figure 17.19):
• Chest – Over the chest and under the armpits
• Hips
• Legs
4. Once the body is secured to the backboard the guest’s head must be secured using the head immobilizer.
Before this can be done, SMR must be transferred back to the primary lifeguard. The squeeze play is a
technique used to accomplish this. The primary lifeguard places one hand under the backboard and the
other hand on the guest’s cheekbones. The second lifeguard lowers the guest’s arms (Figure 17.20)
5. The second lifeguard applies the head immobilizer blocks to the sides the guest’s head and secures the
head with a forehead strap (Figure 17.21)
6. The primary rescuer rechecks straps and moves to the foot of the backboard. The lifeguards work
together to slide the backboard along the pool edge and onto the deck (Figure 17.22)
7. The lifeguards monitor the guest’s condition, maintain normal body temperature, and provide any
additional care until EMS personnel arrive. If the guest vomits the lifeguards must tilt the board onto its
side while supporting the guest’s head
Figure 17.19 Secure the guest’s body to the backboard Figure 17.20 Use the squeeze play to transfer SMR back to
the primary lifeguard.

Team Carry Out Backboarding
When more than two lifeguards are available, they can work as a team to enter the water, secure the guest to
the backboard, and carry the guest out of shallow water such as a zero-depth facility. Follow these steps when
performing team carry out backboarding:
1. The primary lifeguard maintains SMR as additional lifeguards submerge the backboard and raise it under
the guest (Figure 17.23)
2. A second lifeguard takes over SMR while others hold the backboard and secure the body straps
(Figure 17.24)
3. SMR is transferred and the head immobilizer is applied (Figure 17.25)
4. Lifeguards carry the guest from the water and provide care on land (Figure 17.26)

Slide Run-out Backboarding
Slide run-outs provide limited space for backboarding. Since facilities differ regarding the type of slide run out
that may be available your facility will have a specific EAP for removing a guest from a slide run-out. Follow
these general steps for backboarding and extricating a guest from a slide run out:
1. The primary lifeguard maintains SMR at the head of the guest by simply holding the head in line with the
guest’s body (Figure 17.27)
2. Additional lifeguards assist to log roll the guest to the side. The primary lifeguard gives the command to
roll and moves guest’s head with the body (Figure 17.28)
3. Another lifeguard positions the backboard properly so the guest’s head will rest on the immobilization
pad when rolled onto the backboard (Figure 17.29)
4. Roll the guest onto the backboard and secure the body straps (Figure 17.30)

Special Situations
Seated or Standing Guests
Guests with possible spinal injury found sitting on the steps of an attraction or a chair on land do not need to
be placed on a backboard. In these situations, apply SMR by holding the head and neck in a neutral position to
prevent further injury until EMS personnel arrive (Figure 17.33).
If a guest with a possible spinal injury is standing in shallow water or on land apply SMR in the same manner
as seated guests to prevent further injury until EMS personnel arrive (Figure 17.34).If the guest feels weak or
dizzy, additional lifeguards can assist you to lower the guest slowly onto his/her back.In the water the guest can
be lowered onto a backboard. On land the guest can be lowered to the ground.

FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
Spinal injuries can occur in any depth of water and are often caused by high-impact/high-risk activities. Areas
where spinal injuries are more likely to occur include shallow depth areas, attraction walls and bottom, diving
boards, water slides, surfing & paddle board areas and water craft locations.
A guest with a suspected spinal injury exhibits signs that include neck or back pain made worse by movement,
numbness, tingling, burning, weakness, or an inability to move normally. There may also be deformity of the
neck, bruising or blood or bloody fluid in the ears or nose.
If the cause (mechanism of injury) suggests possible spinal injury, and the guest has signs of possible spinal
injury you should care for the guest by using spinal motion restriction (SMR).
The vise grip is the primary SMR technique used to care for a guest in the water. This technique requires you
to restrict movement of the head and neck.
While the rescue tube will not be necessary when performing SMR in shallow water, it is a necessity when the
guest is on the surface in deep water. If the guest is submerged, you must remove your rescue tube, surface
dive, apply the vise grip and swim to the surface with the guest.
Backboarding is the process of placing and securing a guest suspected of having a spinal injury onto a
backboard to maintain SMR so that you can remove the guest from the water. Backboarding and extrication
can be performed in select facilities with as few as two lifeguards. Once the guest is placed on the backboard
fasten the body straps first, then secure the head using the head immobilizer.
You can care for a guest with a suspected spinal injury found seated or standing in shallow water or on land by
providing SMR that simply holds the guest’s head and neck in alignment with the rest of the body, minimizing
movement until EMS personnel arrive.

Open Water Lifeguarding 211
Introduction To Open Water Lifeguarding
The concepts and skills you have acquired so far in this course can be effectively modified for use in open water
environments. The key to making these modifications work begins with your ability to understand the unique
operating challenges an open water facility presents and how your facility accounts for these challenges.
You must become familiar with the unique characteristics of your facility and master the skills required to
maintain safety at the facility. This chapter and the next chapter will provide direction on how to accomplish
those goals. As part of your training, you will learn site-specific techniques and procedures. This will include
hands-on practice sessions at your open water facility using the equipment and devices your facility has
determined to be most effective.
The Designated Swimming Area
Open water facilities will have a prepared area of
water and beach marked as the designated swimming
area. This identifies the safe area for guests to swim
(Figure 18.1). Your facility may mark the boundaries of
the designated swimming area by using:
• Ropes and Floats
• Flags and signs
• Buoys Figure 18.1 Swimming areas have clearly designated
• Piers, docks, floating platforms boundaries.
• Physical landmarks
The designated swimming area is subdivided into Zones of Protection similar to what is used by large
swimming pools and attraction facilities. However, the standard for protecting open water facilities is different
than the standard protection for larger facilities. Here, you will be required to follow the 10/3-Minute
Protection™ Standard which allows a lifeguard 10 seconds to recognize an aquatic emergency and 3 minutes
to perform a rescue and begin care. Each zone will have the following characteristics:
• The entire surface area of a zone can be seen by a lifeguard at the designated duty station within 10
seconds
• Following a pre-determined search and rescue, the entire bottom of each zone can be searched in
3-minutes or less, utilizing a minimum number of facility staff trained in the procedure
Open water facilities will validate their swimming zones periodically to confirm that the 10/3-Minute
Protection Standard can be applied whenever the facility is in operation. This regular validation also allows
you to frequently practice your facility’s bottom search procedure, which will enhance your confidence and
effectiveness in a real emergency.

--- Page 224 Text ---
Open Water Lifeguarding 212
The 10/3-Minute Protection Standard requires you to be vigilant, recognize a guest in distress, and be
responsive (Table 18.1).

to another and providing needed
assistance
“10 Seconds to See”
Water clarity is critical to the success of a pool or waterpark lifeguard’s guest surveillance. In open water,
clarity is rarely adequate to allow visibility below the water surface. In open water facilities, you are not
expected to scan from the bottom up. Instead, you will scan guests on the surface, focusing on guest
behavior. When an open water facility adheres to
the 10/3-minute protection standard, lifeguards
are positioned to allow you see everything on the
surface within 10 seconds. You may assume
responsibility on elevated guard stations or as a roving
lifeguard along the beach. Your facility may also use
water craft to position lifeguards in key locations
of the designated swim area, to allow for complete
coverage (Figure 18.2).
Figure 18.2 At open water facilities lifeguards may be

stationed at a variety of locations, including water craft.
Search
If a guest in distress is submerged or is reported as missing and believed to have been in the water, you will
activate your EAP and begin a coordinated search starting with the zone where the guest was believed to be.
The objective is to search the entire bottom of the zone and locate the guest within 3 minutes. Your facility will
have a specific search procedure for you to follow. This procedure will rely on equipment that will allow for a
rapid search and rescue.

--- Page 225 Text ---
Open Water Lifeguarding 213
Managing Guest Safety
Like lifeguards in other environments, you will also need to be proactive, taking steps to prevent problems
before they occur. In an open water environment, this includes being familiar with the characteristics of
all areas of the designated swimming area. You must be aware when conditions change and alert guests to
emerging dangers that come with these changes. If changes occur that would compromise guest safety, you
must act to return the facility to normal operation. If it is not possible, the facility may need to be closed until it
can be made safe.
Water and Bottom Conditions
Water conditions in open water facilities are something you have little, if any, control over. Performing daily
pre-opening 10/3-Minute Protection Standard validations of each zone is an excellent way to determine the
conditions of the water and the bottom.
Being able to recognize various water conditions will help you and your team keep your facility safe. Table
18.2 describes some water conditions you may encounter and ways you may manage the condition to keep
guests safe.

You will need to be able to recognize when weather might become dangerous. Facilities have numerous
weather monitoring systems to watch for adverse weather in advance so that you will have time to direct
guests to safety. Table 18.3 details various weather conditions and actions to take to manage guest safety in
the event of inclement weather.

Equipment For Open Water Lifeguarding
Your personal equipment such as the rescue tube, hip pack and rescue breathing mask will be the same as that
used in other facilities. Emergency response equipment, such as the backboard, AED, supplemental oxygen,
and related BLS supplies are the same. There is, however, additional equipment that you may use in order
perform your duties. Table 18.4 provides examples of equipment you may use at your facility.
Table 18.4 Open Water Lifeguarding Equipment
Equipment How It is Used
Binoculars To provide a closer look at the zone extremes, check on the status of a guest,
or evaluate approaching weather.
Fins Used for added speed during water rescue emergency procedures and for
underwater searches in deeper water. Fins should be placed on your feet upon
entering the water.
Drag Nets Drag nets are used to help search for a missing guest in shallow water. These
devices are created by modifying a volleyball net or similar netting with
weights, secured between two poles. Each pole is handled by a designated
lifeguard to allow for the sweep of the bottom of a zone being searched. If the
net encounters a submerged guest, the resistance will alert you.

Open Water Lifeguarding 216
Flags Communicate operating conditions to guests:
Green – Swimming area is open
Yellow - Swimming area is open, but caution is recommended
Yellow and Red combined – Swimming area is open, but water and/or
weather conditions are expected to change which may result in closure
Purple – Dangerous marine life has been spotted nearby
(may be combined with red)
Red – Swimming area is closed
Masks and Snorkels Masks are worn to provide you with a clearer and possibly extended view
under water. Snorkels are extended tubes with a mouth piece on one end and
an open end on the other. Masks and snorkels must be properly fitted and
require practice to become proficient in their use during underwater searches.
Kayaks Kayaks are used at some facilities as a means of patrolling the water farthest
from the beach. The kayak acts as a mobile lifeguard platform, allowing you to
quickly navigate to guests in distress or those who have wandered too far from
the beach. Kayaks require specific training and should not be utilized unless
you have completed adequate practice in maneuvers, including safe entry and
exit, effective paddling, rolls and recovery, and how to balance with a guest
using the kayak for support.
Rescue Boards Rescue boards represent a fast way for a lifeguard on the beach to reach guests
in distress. Like other specialized equipment, rescue boards require specific
training and regular practice to become proficient in launching, paddling,
maneuvering, and placing a guest on the board.
Scuba The ability to use scuba equipment for extended underwater searches or other
work may be required. However, scuba training and certification are required
before you should attempt to use this equipment. Once formal training is
completed, additional site-specific training will need to be completed, in
accordance with your facility’s emergency response protocols.
Powered Watercraft In addition to kayaks, powered water craft such as jet skis, and motor
boats may be used by your facility. Watercraft such as these may patrol the
perimeter of the swimming area, allow for additional surveillance, and provide
quick response. Never operate power watercraft without specific training and
only in an official, authorized capacity.

Open Water Lifeguarding 217
Open Water Rescues
Much like a swimming pool, entering open water in response to an emergency needs to be done safely. How
you enter may directly contribute to the outcome of the response, so appropriate care and consideration is
required. When you spot a guest in distress from your duty station, activate the EAP and begin quickly moving
toward the guest.
Responding from the Beach
If your duty station is on the beach, you may need to run a short distance to enter the water. It is recommended
to keep paths to the water from your duty station clear of guests and other obstructions to accommodate your
safe response, but this is not always possible. Grab your rescue tube and secure the excess strap so that it does
not dangle as you run. These measures will help prevent the tube from accidentally hitting guests, getting caught
on objects, or tripping you as you run.
As you move, alternate your gaze between the location
of the guest in distress and your running path. Give
equal attention to both so that you do not lose sight of
the guest and can maintain your own safety. Lift your
knees as you run into the water with high steps (Figure
18.3). Once you are in waist deep water, release the
rescue tube and allow it to trail behind you so that
it does not impede your movement. Reconfirm the
location of the guest in distress and swim quickly to the
guest.
If you lose sight of the guest, continue making progress
Figure 18.3 Lift your knees, using high steps as you run
to the location where the guest was last spotted. Signal
into the water.
to other lifeguards if the guest has submerged so that
they can alter their EAP response accordingly. Depending upon water depth and current, you may attempt
to locate the guest below the surface using a deep-water rescue similar to what is utilized in a swimming
pool. However, visibility may be variable, so having goggles or a mask may be needed. If the guest cannot be
immediately located by the responding lifeguard, then a missing guest search will be required.
Dolphin Diving
If you encounter waves and/or currents, you may choose to use a dolphin dive technique. This technique will help
you move through oncoming waves with minimum impact on your progress toward the guest in distress. Start
by arching your body and diving forward, timing the dive so that you enter the water under the wave. Take care

--- Page 230 Text ---
Open Water Lifeguarding 218
to keep your dive shallow with arms extended to avoid
contact with the bottom. Your momentum will enable
you to glide under the wave, minimizing its impact.
Surface when the glide stops. Confirm the location of
the guest and the next wave and repeat the process as
you move to the guest. When the water becomes too
deep for the technique to be effective, swim toward
the guest (Figure 18.4).
Responding with a Rescue
Board
Figure 18.4 Dolphin diving helps you move through
oncoming waves with minimum impact on your progress.
A Rescue Board is an oversized surfboard that enables
you to quickly paddle to any area of the facility. Enter
the water with the rescue board and allow the rescue
tube to drag behind you (Figure 18.5). When the
water is above knee height, climb onto the board in a
prone or kneeling position. Paddle using crawl stroke
or butterfly stroke (Figure 18.6). As you approach
the guest, allow the guest to hang onto the board,
or extend the rescue tube to the guest. If the guest
cannot grasp the board or tube, get off the board and
execute the appropriate rescue.
Responding with Water Craft
Figure 18.5 Enter the water with the rescue board and
allow the rescue tube to drag behind you.
Each type of water craft will have specific steps to
follow for safe emergency response. The following
general steps apply when responding to a guest in
distress:
• Activate your EAP
• Maneuver your craft alongside the guest, but not
so close that the craft may accidentally injure
the guest
• Turn off the engine, if using a powered water craft
• Extend the rescue tube to the guest
• If the guest is unable to grab the tube, enter the
water and complete the rescue
• If the water craft can hold multiple people, assist Figure 18.6 Climb onto the rescue board in a prone

Rescuing Responsive Guests
For responsive guests, the rescue techniques described
previously in this manual will be effective in open
water. The rescue tube will be critical in maintaining
your safety and the safety of the guest. Communicate
with the guest during the rescue. The time it takes
you to reach the guest, and the water temperature,
may affect the guest’s ability to cooperate during the
rescue. Communicate with other lifeguards if you need
assistance. If a second lifeguard arrives, he or she can
help tow you and the guest toward the beach.
Once you reach a depth that is shallow enough to stand,
Figure 18.7 Assist guests to walk out of the water
release the tube and assist the guest to walk out of the
whenever possible.
water if possible (Figure 18.7). Seat the guest on the
ground and evaluate the guest. Contact EMS if needed.
Rescuing Unresponsive Guests
If the guest is unresponsive, it is critical that you alert other lifeguards and begin the appropriate care:
• Position the guest face up on the rescue tube so that the guest’s head is out of the water
• Move toward the beach
• Open the airway and check for breathing
o If not breathing, begin rescue breathing using your resuscitation mask
If you are in the surf with waves rolling, it is not likely that you will be able to effectively perform rescue
breathing. Move quickly toward the beach keeping the guest’s head out of the water. Once in shallow water,
additional lifeguards should be ready to assist with the extrication. The Carry out technique can be used,
placing the guest on a backboard and moving away from the water. If you arrive at the beach before the team
arrives with the backboard, you can use the shoulder drag to remove the guest from the water:
• Place your arms underneath the guest and grasp the armpits
• Rest the guest’s head on your forearms
• Walk backwards, dragging the guest from the water. The rescue tube will slide out from under the guest
• Lay the guest down, reassess, and provide care
If a second lifeguard is available, work together on each side of the guest to drag the guest from the water.

Suspected Spinal Injuries
The Spinal Motion Restriction (SMR) and backboarding techniques learned earlier in the course work well in relatively
calm open water. But in the surf, with breaking waves or strong currents, it may not be possible to maintain SMR or
perform in-water backboarding. In such cases you should do what you can to keep the head and body in line and
extricate the guest. Your facility will have specific procedures for the conditions you will encounter.
Missing Guest Search
If a guest is reported missing, staff immediately begin performing the facility’s Missing Guest Search EAP. Each
facility will have specific communication, equipment, and plans to effectively execute the search. The following
principles apply for any Missing Guest Search:
• Call 911
• Clear the entire designated swimming area
• Determine the location where the guest was last seen
• Immediately search the zone nearest where the guest was last seen in 3 minutes or less
• If needed, repeat the search in the remaining zones
Other staff, and even guests may be used to search for the missing guest on land, including:
• Restrooms
• Restrooms and locker rooms
• Buildings and structures adjacent to the open water area
• Park or open space adjacent to the open water area
• Parking lots, walking paths, trails
• Beach area away from the designated swim area
If non-staff are used to assist in the non-aquatic portion of the search, they should be coordinated and led by a
staff member who can direct an orderly search, following a pre-determined protocol.
Shallow Water Search
Your facility EAP for shallow water searches may include
a specially prepared drag net operated by several
lifeguards (Figure 18.8). Once the team is in place, the
net drag search will begin following these steps:
• The net is opened and pulled tight by multiple
lifeguards
• When pulled tight, the net is lowered into the
water with the weighted portion on the bottom
Figure 18.8 Use a net drag to conduct a rapid shallow
water search.

--- Page 233 Text ---
Open Water Lifeguarding 221
• The lifeguard team moves in a straight line, at an established pace toward the opposite side of the zone
• Once at the opposite side, the lifeguards reposition themselves deeper, overlapping the previously searched
area by a few feet
• The team moves in a straight line, at an established pace toward the opposite side of the zone
This procedure is repeated until the shallow area of the zone is completely searched or the guest is found.
Deep Water Search
Performing a deep-water search is best accomplished
by using a mask, snorkel, and fins (Figure 18.9). Along
with other lifeguards you need to quickly proceed
to the designated starting point in the zone to be
searched. Your lifeguard team should have a rescue
tube to rescue the guest if found. Once the team is in
place, the search can begin following these steps:
• Searchers should be arranged in a straight line
on the zone’s edge no more than an arm’s length
away from the searcher next to them
• Searchers surface dive to the bottom
• Searchers sweep their hands along the bottom Figure 18.9 A deep water search is best accomplished by
and in front as they begin to move forward, trying using a mask, snorkel, and fins
not to disturb the sediment which may further
compromise visibility
• After a pre-determined number of strokes, the search team surfaces and realigns a few feet back from
where they emerged
• The team performs another surface dive, bottom search and surfaces after the designated number of
strokes
• This is repeated until the team locates the guest or reaches the other side of the zone
• Once at the other side of the zone, the team will shift the search line deeper, while over lapping the area
previously covered by a few feet
This will continue until the entire deep area of the zone is searched or the guest is found.
If it is known that the guest was last seen in the deeper area of the zone, the search should begin near that last
known location. The center of the line of searchers should correspond to the point last seen before the guest
submerged. If a current is present, the direction of the search should follow the direction of the current.

FOR YOUR REVIEW
Summary
Open water facilities will have a prepared area of water and beach marked as the designated swimming area.
The standard for protecting open water facilities is known as the 10/3-Minute Protection™ Standard which allows a
lifeguard 10 seconds to recognize an aquatic emergency and 3 minutes to perform a rescue and begin care.
Water conditions in open water facilities are something you have little, if any, control over. Performing daily
pre-opening 10/3-Minute validations of each zone is an excellent way to determine the conditions of the water
and the bottom.
You will need to be able to recognize when weather might become dangerous. Facilities have numerous
reporting systems to watch for adverse weather in advance so that you will have time to direct guests to safety.
Additional equipment that you may use in order to perform your open water duties includes binoculars, masks,
snorkels, fins, flags, rescue boards, water craft, and scuba.
Lift your knees as you run into the water with high steps. Once you are in waist deep water, release the rescue
tube and allow it to trail behind you so that it does not impede your movement.
Dolphin diving is a technique that will help you move through oncoming waves with minimum impact on your
progress toward a guest in distress.
A Rescue Board is an oversized surfboard that enables you to quickly paddle to any area of the open water facility.
Enter the water with the rescue board and allow the rescue tube to drag behind you. When the water is over
knee height, climb onto the board in a prone or kneeling position. Paddle using crawl stroke or butterfly stroke.
