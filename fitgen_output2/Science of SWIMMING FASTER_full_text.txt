Preface
Welcome to Science of Swimming Faster, a unique book that blends the
theory of swimming science and medicine with practical application.
How many times have you read an article or book chapter describing some
aspect of sport science and swimming yet walked away asking, “How am
I supposed to apply this information with the athletes I work with?” Sci-
ence of Swimming Faster aims to break down that barrier and bridge the gap
between theory and practice—providing just enough theoretical foundation
to show that the authors know what they are talking about before diving
in to discuss what the information means to the swimmer in the water, the
coach on the pool deck, or the parent in the stands.
The world of swimming has changed considerably over the past decade.
We have seen the introduction of revolutionary new suits that have had a
significant effect on performance. We’ve watched athletes take advantage
of performance-enhancing substances, sometimes legally and sometimes
illegally, to achieve a competitive advantage. We’ve seen modifications to
the ways that athletes and coaches approach training and stroke technique,
leading to faster and faster times. We are seeing increasing professional-
ization of swimming at the elite level. No stone is left unturned to achieve
peak performances, and more attention and importance are placed on such
areas as performance nutrition and sport psychology. Greater consideration
is given to dissecting stroke technique and analyzing race performances to
milk every drop of speed out of an athlete. It is true that as athletes get to
the Olympic level, everything affects performance. We are now seeing this
increased level of interest in the sport sciences and sports medicine funnel
down to collegiate, high school, and age-group swimmers as well as to
masters swimmers and triathletes. All swimmers seem to want to know
what they can do to swim faster and more efficiently, while staying healthy
and injury free. Science of Swimming Faster will help athletes and coaches of
all abilities gain scientific insights that will positively affect performance.
Purpose
If you perform a search of the research literature related to swimming, you
would quickly find hundreds of studies on myriad topics. But what can
you do with this information? Most coaches and athletes simply don’t have
time to read and digest every research study that is published. Couple this
with the fact that scientific articles do not typically present information in
a user-friendly format, and it’s easy to see why staying abreast of the latest
advances can become a frustrating endeavor.

But those studies contain a lot of good information—if only it could be extracted
and put in a format that is easy to understand and related directly to challenges
faced by coaches and athletes in the real world of swimming. Enter Science of
Swimming Faster. The information contained here is presented in an easy-to-
understand manner, using swimming terminology and examples that will be
familiar to coaches, athletes, and parents. Training suggestions and sample exer-
cises make the information real and usable right out of the box (or book). As an
added benefit to those who want to delve more deeply into a specific topic, each
chapter provides a comprehensive reference list that will direct you to the most
current research and publications.
Whether you are coach, a swimmer who swims competitively, or a swimmer
who swims just to stay fit, you will benefit from the content in this book.
Content
Science of Swimming Faster is organized into four sections. Part I overviews the
technical aspects of swimming. Chapters are dedicated to understanding the
mechanics of swimming—that is, how swimmers generate propulsive force while
reducing drag—and looking closely at stroke-specific aspects of technique. These
chapters present the latest scientific information, from in-pool studies to computer
simulations of performance. Additionally, this section looks at new and emerg-
ing technologies and ways in which they can be used to dissect the intricacies of
stroke technique and improve in-water performance (chapter 7).
Part II focuses on training and competition. The question has often been asked,
“What is the best way to prepare for competition, and do I really have to train
three hours a day to compete in a race that lasts less than two minutes?” This
section of Science of Swimming Faster looks at how the body responds to training
and what can be done to prepare the body optimally for competition. Chapters
are dedicated to topics such as the physiology of swimming, planning and peri-
odization, and tapering. Information is presented about how elite athletes swim
their races and what coaches and athletes can focus on to improve performances
on race day.
Part III addresses other areas of sport science that have an effect on perfor-
mance—areas such as nutrition, sport psychology, and injury and illness pre-
vention. All these areas are important to swimming performance, but they are
sometimes swept under the rug in favor of focusing only on technique or training.
Also included is a chapter on growth and development and ways to maximize the
long-term development of swimmers. Growth and development is a theme that
weaves through almost every chapter in the book because it affects how athletes
should be viewed and trained. As has been stated many times, young athletes
are not simply small adults. How a coach trains a 10-year-old will differ dramati-
cally from what the same coach would do with a 20-year-old. Remember that no
matter how talented a 12-year-old is, he is not a fully mature Michael Phelps, and
he should not be trained in the same way.

Preface ix
Finally, part IV addresses special swimming populations like the female athlete.
We identify specific differences between males and females that coaches should
keep in mind when working with this group of athletes. Additional chapters are
devoted to masters swimmers, age-group swimmers, open water swimmers, and
adaptive swimmers. No other resource on the market attempts to consolidate this
type of information and present it in one place, let alone share ideas on how best
to work with these athletes on the pool deck.
All in all, this is a one-of-a-kind book, and we hope you enjoy it. We’re confi-
dent that the information contained in Science of Swimming Faster will lead you,
whether you are a coach or an athlete, to new levels of performance.

CHAPTER
Fluid Dynamics,
Propulsion, and Drag
—Timothy Wei, PhD, Russell Mark, and Sean Hutchison
It is fair to say that at some time in their lives, swim coaches, swimmers, and
swim parents (sweating in the bleachers of hot, humid swimming-pool
facilities) have contemplated and discussed what exactly the water does when
someone tries to swim through it. Over the decades, a language and a perceived
knowledge base have evolved across the swimming community about the fluid
dynamics of swimming. Although much of this understanding is sound, some
key elements are either incorrect or have been misinterpreted, resulting in inef-
ficient or counterproductive stroke technique.
The fluid dynamics of swimming is extremely complex. Understanding the
process is further complicated by the fact that seeing what the water is doing as
the swimmer goes by is not possible. Even worse, every swimmer is different.
What works well for one swimmer could be counterproductive for another.
The primary objective of this chapter is to provide a primer on the fundamentals
of fluid dynamics in the context of swimming. First, we cover the fundamentals,
discussing the physics associated with drag and thrust production in a way
that is rigorous and accurate without being daunting to the nonscientist. Next,
in the section “Force and Flow Measurement,” we provide a brief description
of two of the state-of-the-art measurement techniques that have been brought
to the study of swimming. The section “Application to Swimming” contains a
discussion on the fundamental physics of the arm pull. The primary purpose
of this culminating section is to provide the reader with a practical example of
how the fundamentals of fluid dynamics can be applied to stroke analysis to
provide an accurate understanding of what constitutes good stroke production.
Ultimately, no stroke will be perfect, but we open here with the observa-
tion that every swimmer is competing with and against the same laws of fluid
3

dynamics. Understanding those laws in a practical way is crucial to developing
rational approaches to swimming fast.
The Fundamentals
To gain an understanding of the fluid dynamics of swimming, we need to start
with a discussion of some of the basic physical principles. When we discuss
scientific concepts, everyone in the conversation needs to understand the terms
we use. Words such as velocity, acceleration, force, and pressure have distinct mean-
ings, so they cannot be used interchangeably. In this section, we introduce the
key terms and concepts that we will need to know to gain a true understanding
of the fluid dynamics of swimming.
Newton’s Second Law:
The Critical Balance Between Thrust and Drag
A saying in the academic engineering community is that every time you show
an equation, you lose half the audience. Unfortunately, mathematics is the
language of physics, so talking about the fluid dynamics of swimming is virtu-
ally impossible without using equations. Fortunately, in the case of swimming,
almost everything stems from a single equation: Newton’s second law. In its
simplest form, we know it as
F = Ma
or force is equal to mass times acceleration. That is, in order for a body of mass,
M, to undergo an acceleration, a (i.e., to increase velocity with time), we need
to apply a force, F.
In real life, F is often not just a single force. Rather, it is the sum of a number
of forces acting on the body, sometimes simultaneously, sometimes at different
times. In swimming, for example, the swimmer pulls with her arms, kicks with
her legs, and possibly throws in some sort of dolphin motion. The forces created by
these body motions vary with time and do not all occur at the same time, though
presumably an elite swimmer has figured out how to coordinate these forces in an
optimum way to go as fast as possible. These propulsive forces are counteracted by
the resistance of the water to the swimmer’s attempts to move through it.
We can classify the propulsive forces as thrust forces and those that oppose
motion as drag forces. We can rewrite Newton’s second law as
thrust forces − drag forces = Ma
or for simplicity, let’s just write it as
T − D = Ma
Here, T represents all of the propulsive forces and D represents all of the forces
that resist forward motion.

--- Page 16 Text ---
|
Fluid Dynamics, Propulsion, and Drag 5
Note that when we write Newton’s second law in this manner, we can draw
the following insights. If the thrust forces are larger than the drag forces (T >
D), the swimmer will speed up. If the drag is too great, the swimmer will either
slow down (D > T) or will have to work a lot harder (i.e., increase T) to maintain
speed. Finally, regardless of how fast the swimmer is swimming, at a constant
speed the thrust exactly offsets the drag (T = D).
In the context of swimming then, Newton’s second law states that a competi-
tive swimmer needs to maximize thrust while minimizing drag. Maximizing
thrust comes from building strength and improving technique, and minimizing
drag is optimized primarily through adjusting body position in the water. We
will return to this thought at the end of this section.
Note that noncompetitive swimmers who swim primarily for fitness do not
need to worry about minimizing drag. The greater the drag is on the swimmer,
the more calories the swimmer will burn. Still, using those calories to go far or
fast and at less risk of injury is more satisfying.
The next step in this overall discussion is to explore in detail some of the fluid
dynamic principles associated with drag and thrust. Before doing that, however,
we need to throw another equation into the mix, Bernoulli’s equation. This
equation relates pressure with flow speed, a concept important in applications
from airplane design to swimming.
Bernoulli’s Equation
In 1738 Dutch-Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli published the derivation
of an important relation that now bears his name. At its core, it is a mechanical
energy equation for fluid flows that relates the pressure and fluid speed at one
location in the flow to the pressure and speed at another location.
Derivation of the Bernoulli equation involves integrating the forces experi-
enced by a fluid particle as it travels along a streamline from one location to
another. In one respect, this is a pressure equation with units of force per unit
area or (mass / length / time2). The units of the terms in the equation also can
be viewed as kinetic energy per unit volume (mass × length2 / time2 / length3),
which becomes (mass / length / time2). That the Bernoulli equation is a mechani-
cal energy equation stems from the derivation and from the dimensions of the
terms in the equation.
In a somewhat simplified form, the Bernoulli equation is
p = p + 1/2 ρV2 = p + 1/2 ρV 2
o 1 1 2 2
Here, p, p, and V refer to pressure, fluid density, and flow velocity, respec-
tively. The subscripts and refer to two arbitrary locations in the flow where
1 2
we might be interested in comparing pressure and velocity. The first term, p ,
o
represents what is known as either the stagnation pressure or total pressure. It is
the pressure that would result if it were possible to bring the flow to rest, that is,
V = 0.

--- Page 17 Text ---
}
6 Wei, Mark, and Hutchison
The Bernoulli equation may be thought of as a mechanical energy equation;
that is, total mechanical energy in the fluid = potential energy in the fluid at some
location + kinetic energy associated with the moving fluid at that same location.
To understand this better, consider a highly pressurized tank of fluid. Initially,
the tank is closed. The fluid is at rest, and its pressure is as high as it will ever
be. When the tank is opened, the pressure starts to drop as fluid flows out. The
initial pressure in the closed tank is the total pressure, p . It is the maximum
o
potential energy (per unit volume) that the fluid will ever have.
When the tank is opened, fluid starts flowing out; a conversion of energy
occurs from potential energy to kinetic energy. Those familiar with physics
will recognize that the term in Bernoulli’s equation, 1/2 ρV 2, indeed looks like
1
kinetic energy (1/2 MV2, where M is mass and V is velocity). Because density, ρ,
is mass per unit volume, then 1/2 ρV 2 can be understood as kinetic energy per
1
unit volume of fluid. As such, this is probably the easiest term to recognize in
terms of physical meaning. We call this the dynamic pressure.
The remaining term, that is, the pressure in the fluid, p (or p) in Bernoulli’s
1 2
equation, corresponds to the potential energy of the fluid at those locations. This
works out to be the difference of the total pressure and the dynamic pressure.
Alternatively, this is the potential energy that remains after you convert some
of the maximum possible potential energy (the pressure of the fluid at rest)
into kinetic energy (hence the name, dynamic pressure). If the static pressure,
p or p , were ever to drop to zero, that would mean that all the original energy
1 2
available in the flow had been converted entirely to kinetic energy; that is, this
is as fast as the flow could possibly go.
So, in summary, p is total energy, 1/2 ρV 2 is kinetic energy or dynamic pres-
o 1
sure, and p is the potential energy or static pressure remaining in the fluid as it
moves with speed, V. The Bernoulli equation provides a relationship between t e
speed of the water flowing past some part of the body and the pressure of the water
at that point. For a competitive swimmer in a competition swimming pool, the
total pressure is constant. Thus, if the fluid slows down, the static pressure goes
up. If the fluid is moving quickly, then the static pressure in the high-speed fluid
will be low. Observe that if the flow speed changes by a factor of two, then the
static pressure will change by a factor of four because pressure varies as velocity
squared. Additionally, keep in mind that Bernoulli’s equation applies under spe-
cific conditions (e.g., constant density fluids with no viscosity). For our purposes,
the general physical insight provided by this equation is extremely helpful. The
key point to remember is that if we are looking at two points in the flow, say, for
example, on either side of the hand, if the water is flowing faster over one side than
the other, then the pressure will be lower where the flow is faster. If the speeds
are the same on either side of the hand, the pressure will be the same as well.
Drag
We now turn to the forces acting on or generated by a body in water. Let’s define
drag as any force opposing motion of a body or body part in a particular direction.

--- Page 18 Text ---

Fluid Dynamics, Propulsion, and Drag 7
The three types of drag are pressure drag, viscous drag, and wave drag. Pressure
drag is also known as bluff body drag. As the alternative name implies, this is
most dominant when the body is not streamlined, or bluff. Consider for instance,
how you have to lean into the wind on a windy day, shown schematically in
figure 1.1. As the moving air approaches your body, it decelerates. And we know
from the Bernoulli equation that decreasing speed means increasing pressure.
Remember that pressure is force divided by area, or, conversely, force caused
by pressure is pressure multiplied by an appropriate area. It is incorrect, although
common, to use the terms pressure and force interchangeably. This error is perhaps
the greatest contributor to incorrect analysis and understanding of the fluid
dynamics associated with swimming.
Pressure Drag and Viscous Drag
In an ideal fluid, figure 1.1a, the flow would smoothly accelerate around your
body and then decelerate again as it passes around to your back. Note that in
this ideal case, the flow is symmetric front to back. From the Bernoulli equa-
tion, we would then expect that the pressure on the back of your body would
exactly return to the pressure on the front of your body. In this scenario, because
the pressure is the same front to back, you wouldn’t feel any force pushing on
you. Fluid dynamicists refer to this situation as complete pressure recovery. The
concept that you could somehow move through the wind without feeling any
resistance is what is known as d’Alembert’s paradox.

the actual case, (b), appears on the bottom.

8 Wei, Mark, and Hutchison
In real life, of course, the harder the wind is blowing, the more you have to
lean into the wind to avoid being blown over. A great deal of turbulence (lots of
interacting vortices) is generated behind your body. The flow doesn’t return to
being nice and smooth after it passes behind your body. Rather, what is called
a wake region is found behind your body, shown in figure 1.1b, and the pres-
sure immediately behind you does not return to the same level as the pressure
in front of you. Now a pressure difference is seen between the front and back
of your body; the higher pressure is in front, and the lower pressure is in back.
The net force acting against you is the pressure on the front of your body minus
the pressure on the back of your body multiplied by the projected frontal area
of your body, represented mathematically as
pressure drag = (p − p )A
front back front
The projected frontal area is the area of the silhouette that would be formed if
someone were to shine a spotlight from behind you with you standing facing a
wall. That frontal area would naturally be the same whether you were standing
facing the wall or standing with your back to the wall. Because p is larger than
front
p , you feel the wind pushing you backward as you try to move forward into it.
back
This phenomenon is called pressure drag or bluff body drag. If the body shape
does not allow the flow to travel smoothly from front to back, then pressure
drag will be significant. If, however, the body shape permits smooth flow all the
way around, if the body is streamlined like a wing, then pressure drag will be
minimal or nonexistent. That does not mean that the drag will be zero. All real
fluids are viscous, which means there is always a frictional resistance to motion
through or by a fluid. To visualize this, think about a brand new deck of cards.
Imagine that you set the deck on a flat horizontal table and place the palm of
your hand flat on top of the deck. Now imagine sliding your hand horizontally
to the right, as shown in figure 1.2. If the cards were perfectly frictionless, they
would not sense the motion of your hand and the entire deck would stay put. In
figure 1.2, the deck set on the table appears as dark rectangles with light edges.
The deck after the application of the sliding force, F, is shown as grey rectangles.
Clearly, if no friction were present, the before and after pictures would be identi-
cal and look like figure 1.2a.
In reality, some amount of friction is present between your hand and the
top card, between the table and the bottom card, and between the individual
adjacent cards in the deck. In that case, when your hand moves parallel to the
table top, the top card moves with your hand, the bottom card sticks to the
table, and all the cards in between move by varying amounts depending on
how close they are to either the table or your hand. This concept is illustrated
in figure 1.2b. The closer the cards are to your hand, the more they will move.
The closer they are to the table, the less they will move. The card closest to the
table is held in place by the frictional force between the table and that card. The
top card experiences a frictional force imparted by the movement of your hand,
which drags it forward at the same speed as your hand. Each card in between

the top and bottom cards experiences a force pulling it forward from the card
above and a resisting frictional force imparted by the card below. In the end,
the entire deck starts to lean.
Think of viscous or frictional drag in a similar fashion. Instead of playing
cards, think of the rectangles in figure 1.2 as imaginary layers or laminates of
fluid. Think of the tabletop as a streamlined body, say a wing on an airplane. In
this analogy, we would be sitting inside the airplane looking out the window.
The wing looks as if it is stationary, and the air is flowing over the wing from left
to right. If the flow were frictionless, as shown in figure 1.2a, the grey rectangles
would all shift to the right by an equal amount like a giant cardboard box being
blown along the wing. The picture for viscous, or frictional flow, figure 1.2b,
however, would be exactly the same as it was for the deck of cards. The layer of
air closest to the wing would stick to the wing and move with the wing. From our
vantage point looking out the window, it would appear as if it were stationary.
Far away from the wing, the air would simply blow on by. In the region referred
to as the boundary layer the air speed would vary from zero at the boundary out
to the speed at which the plane is flying. This boundary layer region is typically
very thin. Over the wing of a large commercial airliner, it could be only a few
inches (5 to 10 cm) thick before the air passed over the trailing edge of the wing.

Wave Drag
The third form of drag relevant to swimming is wave drag. Probably the simplest
way to gain a conceptual understanding is to remember that as a body moves
through any fluid, a bow wave forms in front of the body. For a boat or a swimmer,
this wave is clearly visible. Below a certain speed, the bow wave sits in front of
the swimmer and the swimmer is essentially swimming uphill, trying to get on
top of the wave but never getting there. This phenomenon is known as wave drag.
For every object, there is a critical speed at which it is possible for the object
to climb up on top of the bow wave. This speed is known as the hull speed. The
formula for calculating the speed at which a body can overcome its own wave
drag is
V = 1.248 × √H
hull
where V is the hull’s, that is, the swimmer’s, speed in meters per second and
hull
√H is the square root of the height of the swimmer expressed in meters.
When V is achieved or exceeded, the swimmer is in a sense surfing her own
hull
bow wave. When this happens, the wave drag drops dramatically and the speed
can increase equally dramatically. To visualize this, think of a motorboat when
you first try to get it to go as fast as it can and then when it later gets to high
speed. When you first push the throttle forward, the hull is deep in the water.
The bow rides very high, the back of the boat is very low, and the boat essen-
tially plows through the water. When the boat speed exceeds its hull speed, the
boat rises out of the water and can accelerate to high speeds by planing across
the top of the water.
The reason that wave drag is so interesting is that the hull speed of a human
swimmer turns out to be right around the same speed as world-class swimming
speeds. As a rough estimate, suppose a swimmer is about 2 meters tall; his hull
speed would be 1.76 meters per second. This speed translates to a 56.7-second
time in a 100-meter race. We are, of course, neglecting the start and turn, but
you will notice that only a relatively few swimmers can swim faster than this.
So the next time you are watching an elite-level race, watch how high or how
low the swimmers are in the water. If you are watching the preliminary heats, you
will probably notice that on average the faster swimmers ride higher in the water
whereas the slower swimmers are lower in the water. Of course, other variables
such as percentage and distribution of body fat will cause certain swimmers to
float higher or lower. The polyurethane and neoprene body suits that were used
in 2008 through 2009 were extremely helpful to many swimmers in terms of
buoyancy. They automatically sat higher in the water and gained much of the
benefit of overcoming wave drag without having to generate the speed necessary
to overcome it.
As a quick summary up to this point, the three forms of drag experienced by
a swimmer are pressure or bluff body drag, viscous or friction drag, and wave
drag. Pressure drag and wave drag are the dominant forms of drag in swimming.
Friction drag dominates only for very streamlined bodies such as airplanes or

animals that depend on high-speed swimming or flight for survival. In those
cases, friction becomes dominant not because frictional drag increases but
because the pressure drag is extremely small, by virtue of body shape. Note that
fish and birds typically do not move at the air or water interface like competi-
tive swimmers do. As such, their wave drag is zero. In any event, swimmers can
do little to eliminate viscous drag. Their focus needs to be on optimizing body
position to reduce pressure drag and optimizing stroke production to maximize
thrust. Swimmers need to be constantly winning the battle between thrust and
drag by both maximizing thrust and minimizing drag.
Thrust
With this thought in mind, let’s spend some time on the fluid dynamics of
thrust. The underlying question in this discussion is, What must a swimmer
do to make the water move in such a way as to generate as much thrust (i.e.,
speed) as possible?
Two thrust generation mechanisms are dominant in competitive swimming:
the thrust associated with the pull of the arms and vortex-induced thrust in
which body motions create an organized system of vortices that effectively pump
fluid along the axis of the body. A third mechanism derived from wing theory
gave rise to the S stroke popular in the 1960s and 1970s that continues at the
club level today. Because of the legacy surrounding the S stroke, we will examine
the underlying aerodynamic theory to provide a framework for comparing the
straight pull with the S stroke.
Actually, a variety of physically accurate ways can be used to explain each of
the thrust production mechanisms. For ease of comparison, the best approach
is to use a single physical concept and relate each of the mechanisms to that
concept. Consider the example of an ice skater standing on a smooth sheet of ice
holding a ball of significant mass. At some instant in time, the skater brings the
ball to his chest and throws it by pushing it away from his chest. You have likely
heard of the law of equal and opposite reaction or possibly the conservation of
linear momentum. In this example, when the skater throws the ball forward,
he ends up being propelled backward. How much or how fast each one moves
depends on their relative weights (or to be precise, their relative masses). If the
ball happens to be a small balloon filled with air, the balloon will move and the
skater’s backward motion will be negligible. But if the ball were the same weight
as the skater, each would move an equal distance in their respective directions.
If the ball were as heavy as a train locomotive (let’s not worry about how he
manages to pick it up), it would be the skater who moves backward.
The takeaway from this example is that to propel himself forward, the swim-
mer must somehow take as much water as possible and throw it along the axis
of his body past his feet. This action will propel him forward in the water. The
trick is that water doesn’t come in easily grabbed balls. Those balls of water are
in fact the same stuff that the swimmer is trying to push his way through. It’s
slippery stuff. The swimmer must learn how to work with the water to push as

much of it past his feet as quickly and effectively as possible. How he does this
is through technique.
One way to propel water along the body and past the feet is to set up a system
of counter-rotating vortices that pump fluid between them in a particular direc-
tion. An easy way to envision this is to think of a baseball pitching machine
consisting of two rubber wheels that are very close together and spinning in
opposite directions. When a baseball is dropped between the two wheels, it is
squeezed through the gap and shot out by the spinning action of the wheels.
The direction of the ball will be perpendicular to the line connecting the centers
of the two spinning wheels.
This example illustrates the principle of vortex-induced thrust. Another
example of this phenomenon is found in a swimming eel, shown in figure 1.3.
As the eel undulates along, it generates vortices on either side of its body. If you
think of the body undulations as a wave, the vortices form in the peaks and
valleys of the waves as shown in the figure. How those vortices are created is
beyond the scope of this discussion. What is important is the orientation and
interaction of the system of vortices. Observe that the two vortices on the top of
the figure (i.e., on the eel’s left side) rotate in a clockwise direction. Conversely,
the two vortices on the eel’s right rotate in a counterclockwise direction. Next,
note that if you were to choose a vortex on one side of the eel’s body, the vortex
closest to the one you’ve chosen is on the opposite side of the eel. Finally, if you
think of the vortex you’ve selected and the vortex closest to it, those two vortices
form a counter-rotating pair. That is, they are two vortices that rotate in opposite
directions like the two spinning rubber wheels on the baseball pitching machine.
This counter-rotating vortex pair pumps fluid backward along the eel’s body,
which in turn propels the eel forward. The vortex pumping action is indicated
by the arrows along the eel’s body. The entire vortex system acts to pump water
along the eel from the head to the tail. The result is a continuous pumping of

fluid and a continuous generation of thrust. If the eel wants to accelerate for any
reason, it snaps its body to create a high-energy wave, producing a system of
much stronger vortices that pump more water, faster, along the axis of its body.
This mechanism is how the dolphin kick works.
The second dominant thrust production mechanism in competitive swim-
ming comes from the arm motions in each stroke. Keeping with our concept of
throwing water backward, the arms and hands push as much water as possible
toward the feet. The arms must move in a manner to maximize both the amount
and the speed of the water being pushed backward.
There is an alternative way to think about this. Let’s return to the earlier
discussion on bluff body drag. Recall that we talked about pressure differences
between the front of the bluff body and the rear. We discussed that in real flows
past bluff bodies, the flow separates from the body, creating a wake region; the
pressure does not recover behind the body, resulting in higher pressure in front
and lower pressure behind. For a body moving forward, for instance, if you stick
your arm out the window of a moving car with your palm facing forward, the
net action of the pressure difference multiplied by the frontal area of the arm
and hand results in a drag force opposing the forward motion.
In the case of the arm stroke, however, the arm moves in the direction oppo-
site the swimming direction. If we think of the hand and arm combination as
a single bluff body with the palm of the hand typically facing toward the feet,
then the pressure on the palm side of the hand and arm will be higher (we hope
significantly higher) than the pressure on the back side. In this case, the drag
experienced by the arm pushing backward through the water is actually a thrust
for the swimmer. In this context, thrust produced by the arm is drag backward.
Wing Theory and Lift
Before closing out this section on the fundamentals of fluid dynamics, let’s
examine the concept of lift generated by wings. This idea is important in the
context of swimming because it is the underlying phenomenon that gave rise
to the S-shape pull pattern that misdirected many thoughts on ideal swimming
biomechanics.
The concept is that the swimmer can generate thrust by sweeping the hand
outward initially and then inward toward the centerline of the body during the
front half of the pull; this is the top of the S. The swimmer then moves the hand
outward again during the back half of the pull. In so doing, the hand acts like
a wing, particularly in the inward sweep. We will examine this in detail in the
discussion of the pull. At this point, we will focus on the underlying theory of
wings.
Figure 1.4 is a sketch of a simple cambered wing. Camber means the wing is
not symmetric top to bottom. In this case, the upper surface is curved whereas
the bottom surface is essentially flat. The direction of the incoming wind is
shown with an arrow labeled with the speed, V. Notice that the wing is at an
angle of attack, , meaning that the wing is tilted up (or down) by an angle we

denote with the Greek letter . The wing is said to have a chord length, b, and
a span, S. For a rectangular wing, the wing planform area is simply the product
of the chord length and the span, that is, A = b × S. This is the projected area,
plan
or the area of the silhouette of the wing from a viewpoint looking straight down
on the wing.
As air flows around the wing, the airspeed on top of the wing will be faster
than the speed under the wing, simply because air must travel a greater distance
over the top of the wing than under the bottom. If you’ve read the discussion
of the Bernoulli equation, you will understand the consequence that the pres-
sure on the upper surface of the wing is lower than the pressure on the lower
surface. We refer to the upper and lower surfaces of the wing as the suction and
pressure surfaces, respectively. Let’s say those pressures are p and p . From
upper lower

by the wing is

V and A are a speed and area, respectively, that are characteristically associated
with the force.
The purpose for this is that it is possible to compare different wing designs
by comparing plots of lift coefficient as a function of angle of attack, that is, C

versus . A characteristic C versus  curve for a simple cambered airfoil like

The important features of figure 1.5 are that lift, that is, C , increases almost

same rate, reaches a maximum, C , and then drops off dramatically. The steep

drop-off in lift is because of stall, when flow no longer smoothly follows the
upper wing surface but instead separates much in the manner of a bluff body.

For simple wings, C ≈ 1. This typically occurs at angles of attack, , between

10 and 15 degrees. Modern commercial airliners use complex systems of flaps
to increase C to as high as 3.5 to 4.0 during crucial times such as takeoff and
Lmax
landing. These planes are also designed to fly at angles of attack much lower
than maximum lift to avoid the disastrous consequences of small changes in
angle of attack leading to stall.
When applied to swimming, the hand is presumably acting as the wing. The
lift on the wing becomes a thrust force when the hand sweeps inward toward
the centerline of the body in the S stroke. You can calculate the thrust that could
be generated by such a motion in which the wing planform area, A , would be
plan
roughly the projected area of the hand; the flight speed, V, would be roughly the
speed at which the swimmer sweeps her hand across her body in the S stroke.
(Note that this is distinctly different from the speed at which the swimmer is
swimming or the speed at which her hand moves in the direction from head
to feet.) We will use some representative numbers when we discuss the fluid
dynamics of the arm pull.
Force and Flow Measurement
Up to this point, we have been discussing in a somewhat theoretical way forces
that swimmers apply to the water. You have likely gained some practical insights
into fluid mechanics that will be helpful with respect to swimming. In this
section, we provide a description of some of the state-of-the-art measurement
systems used in fluid mechanics.
Ultimately, the challenge to understanding the fluid dynamics of swimming
is knowing exactly what the water is doing as the swimmer swims through it
and what resulting forces the swimmer generates. Two key advances in flow and
force measurement techniques have made it possible to provide time-resolved
data of both flow and force.

--- Page 27 Text ---
}
16 Wei, Mark, and Hutchison
The first of these is an adaptation of a noninvasive flow measurement technique
called digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV), a term first coined by Willert and
Gharib in 1991. The technique employs a high-resolution digital video camera
to record flow seeded with very small reflective particles. Every individual video
image in the recording is then captured and stored in a computer as raw data.
A DPIV processing program takes pairs of successive video frames in the
recording (known as DPIV image pairs) and computes how much the seed par-
ticles have moved from one frame to the next. An example of how this process
works appears in figure 1.6. Two successive video frames taken from flow past
a cylinder are shown in figures 1.6a and 1.6b. Note that the images shown are
only about 10 percent of the full frames. You can see the cylinder on the left side
of both images and many little white dots that are reflections of laser light off
small silver-coated glass spheres. In the lower right of figure 1.6a a white square
has been drawn around a group of particles. In the second frame, figure 1.6b,
the particles have moved. The previous location of the particles is shown as a
square with a dotted white line. The new location of the particles is indicated
by a square with a solid white line. Assuming that the particles move exactly
with the flow, the flow velocity associated with the water in the square region
shown is then simply the particle displacement divided by the time between
images. In practice, the computer is programmed to subdivide the two frames
into identical grids of small squares like the one shown in figure 1.6a. By repeat-
ing the velocity calculation for the entire video frame and for every image pair
in the video record, we can generate movies of the fluid velocity everywhere in
the camera field of view.
Examples of DPIV measurements of flow around swimmers are shown in
figures 1.7 and 1.8. Figure 1.7 shows flow from the feet of Megan Jendrick as she
is doing a breaststroke kick. This single still frame was taken from a movie in
which small air bubbles were used as the seeding particles. The movie was gener-
ated by filming Megan swimming in a flume with the bubbles in the water. We
calculated the velocity vectors for each pair of video frames in the video sequence
and then overlaid the measured velocities on top of the original video images.
In this single frame, Megan’s feet can be observed just as she is beginning
the power stroke of her kick. She is swimming to the right, and her body has
passed out of the field of view. Only her ankles and feet appear in this frame.
Notice the long dark vectors pointing straight back from the bottoms of her feet.
This particular image was used in an analysis of breaststroke kicking that led to
an understanding that the thrust generated during the kick was probably best
thought of as having the feet push water straight back in the thrust direction.
The strength of Megan’s kick greatly contributed to her winning gold in the 100
breaststroke event at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney.
Figure 1.8 is another single still frame showing an overlay of the original
video frame and the corresponding flow vectors. In this example, flow associ-
ated with Ariana Kukors’ freestyle pull is highlighted. In this image, Ariana’s
head and upper torso are visible. The key feature of figure 1.8 is the long dark
vectors extending from Ariana’s right hand as she engages the water early (i.e.,

dots are images of small silver-coated glass seed particles illuminated by laser light. It
is possible to see how the particles have moved from the first frame (a) to the next (b).
For example, observe how the particles identified by the white square have moved up
and to the left.

winning combination that led her to break the world record in the 200 IM twice
as she took gold in that event at the 2009 World Championships.
Besides measuring flow, we can also directly measure forces generated by swim-
mers. This is done using a force balance shown in figure 1.9. This is essentially
a much larger scale model of force measurement devices used in wind tunnels
to measure forces on airplane models.
As shown in figure 1.9, the balance consists of a steel frame, shown as black
lines. If the swimmer pushes on either bar A-A or bar Aρ-Aρ, a time-varying
force, F(t), will be applied to the frame. In the figure, a swimmer is shown doing
an underwater dolphin kick and is pushing on bar A-A. Two load cells, or force
sensors, are mounted on the vertical frame elements, A-C, to measure the verti-
cal component of the applied force. At the same time, load cells are mounted on
the top two horizontal frame elements to measure the horizontal component
of the force applied by the swimmer.
A single frame from a video recording of Ariana Kukors’ flutter kick is shown
in figure 1.10. In this video Ariana is kicking against the force balance that is

The smaller peaks between the larger peaks on the time trace are particularly
interesting. The larger peaks are spaced roughly 0.25 seconds apart, and the
peak force was generally between 20 and 25 pounds (between 9 and 11 kg).
Each peak corresponds to the downward kick of one of Ariana’s legs. As noted,
the peak at t = 0 corresponds to a left-leg kick. The peak to the right of that is a
right-leg kick. The one immediately after that is another left-leg kick and so on.
Note the smaller peaks between the larger ones. These are the forces gener-
ated when Ariana kicks backward, or up toward the water surface. The ability
to quantify the force generated during this reverse kick shows the power of the
measurement technique. Clearly, this force is significantly less than that gener-
ated during the downward, or forward, kick. This result is not surprising; when
was the last time you saw a soccer player run up to a ball backward and kick a
hard shot past a diving goalie? The data create the opportunity for the coach and
swimmer to discuss the relative benefits of generating this additional thrust at
the cost of using energy that might be needed at the end of a race.
Application to Swimming:
Optimizing the Arm Pull
We end this chapter with a discussion of how the fundamentals presented can
be meaningfully and accurately brought into the analysis of a swimming stroke.
Although four distinct strokes are used in competitive swimming, the arm pull
for all of them share a characteristic that we will focus on in this chapter. In
particular, swimmers need to catch the water as early as possible and get as
much of the forearms as possible perpendicular to the swimming direction. The
swimmer should get her hands and forearms pointed straight down toward the
bottom of the pool as quickly as possible, especially for the free and fly. For the
backstroke, the hand does not point down, but the forearm and hand should
become aligned perpendicular to the swimmer’s long axis as quickly as possible.
This happens, of course, after the start of the pull and not before. Otherwise,
the arms are a major source of drag.
When the pull is initiated in this way, we can think of the swimmer trying to
move her arms backward in the direction opposite where she wants to go. While
the arm is being pushed along the body toward the feet, the resulting drag force
on the arm is actually toward the head in the thrust direction. This is the concept
of drag backward discussed earlier. By getting the arms perpendicular to the
swim direction as early as possible, the swimmer maximizes this drag backward
and therefore maximizes thrust. Because this chapter is not a primer on stroke
technique, the swimmer and her coach need to work out the mechanics of this
concept to maximize thrust at the highest possible rate (i.e., stroke count) while
maintaining good body position in the water.
At this point, we return to the discussion of the S stroke. The purpose here is
to explain why elite swimmers and coaches today are emphasizing the straight-
line pull as opposed to an S stroke. This approach is counter to a decades-long
perception of proper swim technique.

--- Page 31 Text ---
}
20 Wei, Mark, and Hutchison
The rationale for the S stroke can be easily understood by thinking about
what happens when you stick your hand out of a moving car window with your
hand slightly cupped and your palm facing down. If you twist your hand so
that the thumb is slightly higher than the pinky finger, you will feel your hand
being pushed up. If you twist your hand in the opposite direction so the thumb
is lower than the pinky, then you will feel your hand being pushed down. In
effect, you are using your hand as a small wing. If you twist your hand too far,
so that the palm faces forward into the direction you are traveling, you will, of
course, feel the bluff body drag discussed previously.
Developers and proponents of the S stroke believed that by pulling diagonally
across the body, a swimmer combined the effects of bluff body thrust and hydro-
dynamic lift. To test this reasoning, we will do a simple quantitative analysis in
the following paragraphs. It is sufficient to note that the S stroke likely produces
about 8 to 18 percent less thrust than the straight pull used at the top levels of
swimming today.
For this comparison, we need to recall the definition of the force coefficient,
C = F / (1/2 ρV2A), which can be written either as a drag coefficient, C , or a lift
F D
coefficient, C . We next make a number of physically justifiable approximations
L
to simplify the analysis without unduly skewing the conclusions. The first of these
approximations is that the swimmer’s arm speed during the pull will essentially
be the same regardless of whether he does a straight pull or an S pull. The second
approximation is that C ≈ 1.0 on the arm. This estimate is based on knowledge
D
that C = 1.0 for a circular cylinder of the same diameter and speed as a typical arm.
D
The final assumption is not entirely correct, but we will err in favor of the
S stroke. Specifically, we assume that the lift coefficient of the hand will also
be unity, so C ≈ 1.0. For small private planes, wing lift coefficients of 1.0 are
L
common. To assume that the hand performs as a lifting surface as well as a
Cessna wing is generous.
Figure 1.11 is a simplified schematic comparing the hand trajectories for an
S stroke and a straight pull. The heavy dashed curve on the far left of the figure
represents the path taken by the left hand of a swimmer when viewed from
above. The straight solid black arrow on the far right of the sketch represents
the trajectory of the right hand for a straight pull. The velocity of the hand in
the straight pull is indicated by the shorter vertical downward arrow labeled
V . Recall that for a velocity vector, the length of the arrow corresponds to
straight
the speed and the orientation of the arrow indicates direction.
Immediately to the right of the S stroke hand trajectory is a triangle made of
dashed velocity vectors. The vector pointing down and to the left, labeled V ,
S
denotes the hand velocity through about the top 60 percent of the stroke. Note
that we have assumed that the magnitude of V is the same as the magnitude of
S
V . You will therefore find that the lengths of the V and V arrows are
straight S straight
equal. The other two vectors, V and V , making up the triangle represent
S-thrust S-lift
the two components of V in the thrust and lift directions (i.e., the swim and
S
cross-body directions, respectively).

between 20 and 30 degrees, then the arm speed in the direction of motion will
be 6 to 13 percent slower than for a straight arm pull. Recall that the bluff body
thrust is 1/2 ρV2A C and that the drag coefficient, C , is 1.0 for the arm regard-

less of whether it is an S or straight pull. The area of the arm, A , presented to

the flow will also not be significantly different for the two strokes. So ultimately,
then, the difference in thrust between the two strokes is the difference between
V 2 and V 2. If the difference in velocity is 6 to 13 percent, then the dif-
S-thrust straight
ference in velocity squared, or thrust, is 12 to 26 percent. The straight arm pull
produces significantly greater bluff body thrust.
For a swimmer doing an S stroke, the lift generated by the hand from the
sideways motion across the body must make up for that lost thrust. The thrust
generated by the sweeping motion of the hand is given by 1/2 ρV2A C . Recall
hand L
that we assumed C ≈ 1.0. For a 20 to 30 degree inward sweep, V will be

or 34 to 50 percent of V . But keep in mind that the hand is only a quarter
straight
to a third of the length of the arm. So if we assume that the area of the hand is a
third of the area of the arm, then for a 20-degree arm sweep, the hand generates
only 4 percent additional thrust for a net loss of 8 percent in comparison with

a straight arm pull. The hand obviously generates more lift for the 30-degree
sweep, 8.3 percent to be precise, but a 26 percent loss of bluff body thrust also
occurred. So the net loss in thrust for the 30-degree S stroke is something close
to 18 percent in comparison with the straight arm pull. And this assumes that
the hand really does work as well as an engineered airfoil. The net result is that
the S stroke produces between 8 and 18 percent less thrust than the straight arm
pull. The only way to make up that difference would be for the arm to move
roughly 5 to 10 percent faster than V . But then the benefits of the S stroke
straight
are lost because the swimmer must work much harder to reach the same speed.
Summary
In this chapter, we have focused on the underlying physics, specifically the move-
ment of water, associated with swimming. We have examined the principles
behind thrust and drag. Presumably, the reader started the chapter already know-
ing that the swimmer needs to present as small a cross-section as possible to the
water, that is, to streamline. You should now also have a better understanding
of what needs to go into a more powerful stroke. For example, the concept of
drag backward on the arm leads to the high elbow entry for the arm pull, par-
ticularly in the free and fly. And perhaps most important, we have provided an
analysis of the S stroke as a practical example of how we can use fluid dynamics
fundamentals to draw meaningful conclusions about the relative benefits and
limitations of a particular stroke.

CHAPTER
Freestyle Technique
—Ross H. Sanders, PhD, and Carla B. McCabe, PhD
In competitive swimming, swimmers can use any stroke and any stroke tech-
nique in freestyle events. Because front crawl is the fastest and most efficient
of the four competitive strokes, swimmers invariably use it in freestyle events.
Thus, freestyle universally implies front crawl, and it is used in this chapter to
mean front crawl swimming.
In this chapter we investigate freestyle technique and training. The topic is
presented in three sections. In the first, freestyle technique in general is explored.
The second section examines differences in technique at different paces (sprint
and longer distance events) and the effect of fatigue. The third section deals with
application of the general training principles to freestyle swimming.
Understanding Freestyle Technique
As in all the strokes, freestyle swimming is cyclical. So where do we start as we
attempt to break down and understand the freestyle stroke technique? Strictly
speaking, the stroke should really have no parts because all movements are con-
tinuous and the transition from one movement to another should be smooth.
In this chapter, we refer to phases of the freestyle stroke for convenience of
presentation, but you should recognize that the stroke is continuous. A major
responsibility of a good teacher or coach is to ensure that the stroke is continu-
ous and rhythmical.
In fact, rhythm is an essential element of swimming that separates efficient
from less efficient swimmers (Sanders and Psycharakis 2009). The more efficient a
swimmer is, the faster he can travel for a given rate of energy expenditure. Swim-
mers who are still developing their technique often have everything operating
23

smoothly with good timing of the legs and arms and streamlined posture until
they have to take a breath. Then the whole thing falls apart, suddenly becoming
jerky and uncoordinated. The additional task, breathing, has upset the rhythm.
In contrast, skilled swimmers are able to maintain good rhythm that is not
disrupted by breathing. Skilled swimmers are also able to change the frequency
and amplitude of the kick readily without affecting the rhythm of the arms,
body roll, or breathing. Accomplished swimmers can swim in a rhythmical and
coordinated way when the swimming pace and kicking frequency change, such
as when the kick changes from a two-beat kick in which each foot goes up and
down once during the stroke cycle (from hand entry until the next entry of the
same hand) to a six-beat kick in which each foot goes up and down three times
during the stroke cycle.
How do coaches develop good rhythm among swimmers? Good rhythm is
achieved by having appropriate timing of the body actions. To monitor and train
rhythm, having some sort of reference to which body actions can be adjusted
would be useful. In a grandfather clock, the timing is maintained by the regular
oscillation of a pendulum. What could act as the rhythm generator in freestyle
so that the motion of the legs, arms, and breath are sequenced in a way that
maintains the rhythm?
Could the arm pull determine the timing of the swimming actions? It could,
but the problem with using the arms as the rhythm generator is that their
rhythm also changes in complex ways. They don’t rotate about the shoulder
joint in a simple regular pattern. For example, the rotation about the shoul-
der joint is much faster during the pull than during the entry and stretch. Unlike
the flutter kick in which there is a regular alternation of the feet, the temporal
relationship between the arms is constantly changing. In a catch-up technique,
in which one arm stays in the extended glide position while the other recovers,
this change is even greater. Similarly, skilled swimmers such as Sun Yang, the
current 1,500-meter world-record holder, regularly switch between two- and
six-beat kicks during a race without disrupting their rhythm and coordination.
Body Roll as a Clock Setter
The motion that sets the clock and serves as the temporal reference to coordi-
nate all the actions is the rotation of the body about its longitudinal axis, or
body roll. This rotation needs to occur all the time in a regular pattern, just like
the oscillation of the pendulum in the grandfather clock, to maintain rhythm.
Figure 2.1 shows that the temporal pattern of the shoulder roll (a measure
of body roll) of a skilled swimmer during a stroke cycle is like a sinusoidal
wave.
If, for example, the timing of breathing is set to the time when the body is
rolled maximally to one side, when the pendulum has reached its most extreme
position and is about to start back the other way, then breathing shouldn’t dis-
rupt the rhythm. In fact, many skilled swimmers roll the same amount whether
they are breathing or not breathing, and they roll the same amount to both the

breathing side and the nonbreathing side. Further, their arm actions are not
changed much by breathing. In contrast, less-skilled swimmers show disruptions
to this sinusoidal pattern when they take a breath.
During the development of swimming technique, teachers and coaches need to
encourage breathing to both sides. Learners often have a favorite breathing side,
but coaches should encourage breathing to the nonfavored side once or twice per
length. Problems that arise from not practicing breathing to both sides include
• rolling more to one side and leaning on one arm,
• asymmetrical posture such as the upper body and head twisting excessively
to one side,
• one side of the body contributing more to the stroke than the other, and
• different balance and timing of right-arm and left-arm actions.
Setting the body roll rhythm and then coordinating the other arm and leg
actions to suit would seem to make sense. Having a simple regular rhythm as a
foundation for the other actions offers obvious advantages.
Stroke Phases and Links to Body Roll
In this section we explore how the phases of the stroke are linked to the rhythm
of the body roll. The elements of good technique emerge from the swimmer’s
attempts to ensure that her actions are tuned to the body roll with timing that
promotes effective propulsion and streamlined alignment.

Recovery Phase
Coaches should emphasize a high-elbow position in recovery for several reasons.
One of the main reasons is that it helps ensure that the arm does not swing out to
the side. Outward swinging of the upper limbs (i.e., a wide recovery) produces a
reaction in which the lower limbs naturally rotate in the opposite direction (figure
2.2). Beginning swimmers typically swing the arms out wide to the side as they
recover. Consequently, the lower body swings laterally to balance the rotation
of the arms. The legs then act as a brake, creating drag and making it difficult
to move through the water easily. The emphasis on a high-elbow recovery helps
minimize this problem so that the swimmer can maintain good alignment to
minimize resistive force (drag).
A high-elbow recovery doesn’t necessary mean that the elbow is flexed so
that the hand is below the elbow. Many elite swimmers, including Janet Evans,
who held the world record for 800-meter freestyle for many years, have been
highly successful with a recovery in which the hand is higher than the elbow.
But shoulder flexibility combined with body roll enables these swimmers to
recover the arms close to the midline of the body rather than swing out to the
side. Thus, both bent-elbow and straight-arm recovery styles can be effective if
the mass of the upper limbs is not very wide of the midline during recovery. One
of the advantages of rolling the body is that it enables the hand to exit easily and
to recover without the arm and forearm swinging out to the side.
a b

alignment. (b) An unskilled swimmer displaying a wide recovery, which causes the lower
limbs to swing laterally.
Reach and Entry Phase
As the arm reaches forward, the body rolls to the other side. Let’s say that the
right arm is recovering and the body is rolling from having the right side out of
the water to having the left side out of the water.
Depending on the amount of catch-up the swimmer is using, at some stage
during the arm recovery and entry, the other arm will make its catch and start
moving through its pull. The timing of that relative to the position of the recover-
ing arm varies according to the amount of catch-up that the swimmer is using,

Freestyle Technique 27
which is influenced to some extent by whether the swimmer is swimming at a
leisurely pace or sprinting (Millet et al. 2002; Lerda and Cardelli 2003; Seifert,
Chollet, and Rouard 2007). The roll onto the right side (left side coming out of
the water) allows the swimmer to breathe to the left if she wants to. The head
rotates as part of the body roll and turns just sufficiently to enable breathing in
the hollow created by the head itself. There is no need for the head to lift back
or for the body to roll farther than it would if breathing wasn’t required. The
obvious implication is that if the swimmer’s body roll rhythm is correct and
the other actions are tuned to it appropriately, then breathing should not cause
any disruption to the rhythm.
The body roll is important in developing a technique that is free of the common
irregularities in breathing. For example, many swimmers, even swimmers at
advanced stages of learning, have the unnecessary habit of raising the head back
when breathing. This action increases the surface area exposed to the flow and
thereby increases resistance. Second, it disrupts the rhythm and body alignment.
As the body approaches its maximum body roll, the right hand and forearm
slice into the water and stretch forward. The word stretch can be misleading
because the use of this word as a verbal cue to swimmers can cause them to try
to push the hand too far forward, thus disrupting alignment and streamlining
because the upper body kinks to the left. But when the body is rolled to the side,
the hand can naturally reach comfortably forward without causing this mis-
alignment. In fact, the rolled position of the body assists streamlining because
the head is naturally nestled close to the upper arm. The good alignment and
streamlining minimize disruption to the water flow around the body.
The rolled position minimizes form drag (resistance because of the difference
in pressure between the leading and trailing boundaries of the body parts). Also,
because the body has a narrower cross-section moving through the water, one
shoulder is clear of the water while the other is below the surface. Disturbance at
the air and water interface is minimal, thereby minimizing wave drag (resistance
caused by making waves as the body moves through the water or air interface)
as well as form drag.
Catch and Insweep (Pull Phase)
The body roll has helped align the arm and body to a streamlined posture. In
accordance with the principle of minimizing time of resistive forces, the hand
and forearm should be positioned quickly to make a strong and early catch,
particularly in sprint swimming. In longer events a small glide before the catch
is appropriate because it helps maintain a good rhythm at a slower stroke rate.
The short glide helps optimize body alignment to reduce resistance and obtain
maximum benefit from the propulsion gained by the other hand. It improves
stroke length, allows some physiological recovery, and optimizes economy.
After the short glide the transition into the catch and insweep should be
quick. A common fault is allowing the arm, forearm, and hand to drop lazily
before making the catch. During that period the limbs are not streamlined, so

--- Page 39 Text ---

28 Sanders and McCabe
they cause resistance. An elbow-up position creates a strong lever system and
enables internal rotation of the shoulder to generate propulsive force. Thus, the
elbow-up position should be emphasized to ensure that the catch and initial
part of the pull are performed strongly.
The body roll helps to streamline the arm and body and to place the muscles
in a strong position to commence the pull. The body is near its maximum roll
as the catch is made. The roll, combined with shoulder internal rotation and
elbow flexion, adds greatly to the speed of the hand and therefore propulsion
during the insweep. The roll itself is pulling the arm, forearm, and hand, thereby
creating additional hand speed.
Underwater views show that good swimmers move their hands very quickly
under the water even though actions above the water appear relatively slow
and relaxed. Good swimmers create fast hand speeds not only by extending
the shoulder (pulling the arm back) but also by internally rotating the shoulder
with the elbow somewhat flexed. This action allows the hand and forearm to
move quickly at an orientation that accelerates a large mass of water using a large
surface area. The larger the mass accelerated and the greater the acceleration of
that mass, the larger the propulsive force.
Upsweep (Push Phase)
The hand moves from the insweep into what is commonly called the upsweep.
Although these terms are used in the literature, the upsweep is not so much an
upward sweep but a continuing backward push that also happens to coincide
with the hand moving up to the surface. Mechanically, a transition occurs from
internal rotation to a backward push in which elbow extension and shoulder
extension are prominent. The body roll reverses during the transition from the
insweep to the upsweep and helps to maintain the backward motion with a sort
of flinging action. Just as trunk rotation contributes to a powerful throw when
an athlete is throwing a ball forward, trunk rotation in swimming helps fling
the hand back to apply more backward force for a longer time.
Hip and Leg Actions
Coaches need not be too concerned about teaching the body roll of the hips for
several reasons. First, the hips do not roll as much as the shoulders do, as can be
seen in figure 2.3. Second, the hip roll tends to occur automatically in response
to the shoulder roll. Therefore, if the roll of the upper body is taught properly,
then the hips and legs will roll automatically. Further, allowing the hips to roll
to some extent makes it easier for the shoulders to roll through an appropriate
range of motion.
The implications for the legs are that it is not necessary—in fact, it is coun-
terproductive—to try to keep the feet kicking perfectly in the vertical plane.
Allowing the hips and legs to roll so that the leg kick is oblique is beneficial in
helping to offset the tendency for the lower body to swing out in reaction to

the arm action. Oblique kicking can cancel that tendency and therefore prevent
the added resistance that occurs because of the legs swinging out to the side.
The legs and feet remain in a narrow channel aligned with the body, thereby
minimizing resistance.
Therefore, roll of the hips and oblique kicking should be encouraged. Coaches
can help swimmers understand that they are not expected to stay flat and not
rotate. The analogy of the sleek yacht that is alternately tilted to one side and
then the other can be useful in developing a beneficial image with regard to the
rolling action of the lower and upper body.
This discussion emphasizes the value of using realistic kicking drills in which
swimmers practice kicking while also rolling the body. Kickboards designed to
encourage rather than discourage rotation should be used. The wider and flat-
ter the kickboard is, the more it tends to limit the natural roll of the swimmer.
Rolling is also easier if the swimmer has the hands close together rather than
near the edges of the kickboard.
Reducing Drag and Increasing Economy
To reduce the effort required to maintain a certain speed, or alternatively to
increase the speed for a given effort, the swimmer must reduce resistance. When
that happens, an increase in stroke length and a reduction in stroke rate will
occur at any given speed. It sounds simple and obvious, but reducing resistance
may be more easily said than done.

A sloping body that may arise because of the tendency for the legs to sink is
one of the major contributors to resistance. This problem can be partially over-
come by kicking. Kicking produces a counter torque to balance the body and
allow it to travel in a more level position (figure 2.4).
a

 Figure 2.4 (a) Swimmer not using a flutter kick experiencing increased drag. (b)
Swimmer using an effective leg kick and having better horizontal alignment.
Obviously, kicking has a physiological cost. Therefore, we need to look for
mechanisms by which the rotational torque because of the buoyancy force being
in front of the gravitational force can be reduced. When kicking is absent, the
body’s rotational equilibrium is attained at a much greater angle and the swim-
mer’s motion is greatly affected by resistive drag. The body attains rotational
equilibrium at a particular body angle and speed using torques generated by the
force of water pushing against the angled body. The force tends to lift the legs
but also adds to the resistive drag.
What other torques can be used to attain horizontal alignment? The catch-up
technique, in which the pull is delayed until the recovering arm is about to enter
the water, reduces the sinking legs effect. The catch-up technique places more
mass forward of the lungs, and for a longer period, than the high-stroke-rate
technique used by unskilled swimmers does. Consequently, the center of mass
and center of buoyancy are more closely aligned, thereby reducing the turning
effect that tends to sink the legs. Thus, we have the desirable situation whereby
resistance is reduced, stroke rate is reduced, speed is maintained, and, as a con-
sequence, stroke length is increased. Further, the rate of energy expenditure is
reduced because the effort supplied by the pulling arm is applied with reduced
rate because of the longer cycle time.
Another torque that tends to sink the legs is the torque produced by the upward
force in reaction to the downward movement of the arm and hand during and
after entry. When a swimmer is attempting to cycle the arms quickly, the hand
and arm tend to be driven downward rather than stretching forward and hold-
ing a level position, as in the case of the catch-up technique. When the pull

commences in the catch-up technique, the forces can be generated so that the
upward component that tends to produce unwanted sinking rotation is relatively
small. That is, the swimmer focuses on pulling backward rather than pushing
downward. Further, at this time, the recovering arm is well forward and is above
the water, thereby producing a strong torque that counters the sinking torques.
In summary, the catch-up technique reduces resistance by two main mecha-
nisms:
1. It reduces the torques that tend to sink the legs by moving the center of
mass forward so that it coincides more closely with the center of buoyancy.
2. It encourages appropriate range and timing of body roll. Thus, the swimmer
can readily adopt positions that minimize resistance during some phases
of the stroke, particularly during exit and recovery.
Body Roll and Resistance
In Total Immersion, Terry Laughlin and John Delves (1996) provide an effective
analogy for reducing resistance by the swimmer being more on the side. In this
analogy they compare the resistance of a flat barge with that of a leaning yacht.
The leaning yacht cuts the surface with a narrower profile and thereby produces
less wave and form drag. Unskilled swimmers frequently have inadequate body
roll. Also common among unskilled swimmers is the tendency to roll and wobble
all over the place. These unstreamlined positions do not facilitate smooth flow
of water over the body.
A range of body roll whereby the cross-sectional area cutting through the
water at its surface is less than when the body is flat is desirable in reducing
wave drag and form drag. When the swimmer has one arm stretched forward,
roll of up to 60 degrees about the long axis facilitates a streamlined position to
glide through the water. In this position the water can flow readily along the
body with little disruption around the submerged shoulder. Further, the body
roll allows the arm to be merged nicely with the head. Meanwhile, the body
roll assists the shoulder of the recovering arm to be clear of the water so that the
adverse effects of its irregular shape on flow are minimized.
The slower stroke rate associated with the catch-up technique also enables a
suitable range of body roll while maintaining good flow characteristics. When
the stroke rate is fast, the roll associated with the pull is well underway during
the recovery of the nonpulling arm. Therefore, having the resistance-reducing
posture described earlier is not possible. Further, when swimming with a fast
stroke rate, rolling through a large angle is difficult, in part because of a lack of
time. Also, attempting a large body roll in a short period makes it difficult to
maintain a smooth flow of water over the body. The rapid changes in posture
tend to produce turbulence and increase drag.
Therefore, a catch-up technique can be economical. The challenge is to gain
the benefits of a catch-up technique without reducing stroke rate so much that
speed falls below that required to be competitive over the specific event distance.

Differences in Technique Between
Sprint and Distance Swimming Pace
In the previous section, we discussed freestyle technique in terms of optimiz-
ing propulsion, minimizing resistance, and maximizing efficiency. To achieve
those goals the actions of the arms and legs are tuned to the rhythm of the body
roll. But when swimming at different paces, a swimmer must adapt technique
to suit the changing demands of that pace. This section explores the differences
in technique between sprint pace and distance pace.
Race Parameters
The main difference between swim paces is the combination of stroke frequency
(also referred to as stroke rate and expressed either as stroke cycles per minute
or seconds per stroke cycle) and stroke length (expressed as meters travelled per
stroke cycle) used by a swimmer to optimize swimming speed. Compared with
distance swimming, sprint swimming is characterized by a greater average swim
velocity and stroke frequency. Because of the higher stroke frequency when sprint-
ing, the stroke length is typically less because the swimmer has less travelling time
per stroke. That is, the greater swim velocity does not compensate adequately to
enable the same distance to be covered in the reduced time available.
When swimming longer distances, sprint speeds cannot be maintained
because of the body’s inability to supply adequate energy to the muscles. As
muscles increase their speed of contraction, energy expenditure rises rapidly. In
fact, energy expenditure of a muscle is proportional to the cube of the speed of
the muscle’s contraction. Thus, the energy required to swim at faster stroke rates
goes up dramatically in sprint events and, consequently, stroke frequency needs
to slow to reduce the rate of muscle contraction and therefore delay the onset of
accumulating lactic acid (Maglischo 2003). The fact that sprinting is character-
ized by a higher stroke frequency and lower stroke length than distance swim-
ming explains the negative relationship between these variables as reported in
the literature (Keskinen and Komi, 1993; Arellano et al. 1994; Pelayo et al. 1996;
Maglischo 2003). Each swimmer needs to find his optimal stroke rate to maxi-
mize performance at each event pace. This optimum varies considerably among
swimmers because of differences in physiological makeup, body shape, and limb
lengths (anthropometric characteristics). Specifically, stroke length is positively
related to the height of the swimmer, arm span, arm length, and hand and foot
cross-sectional area (Grimston and Hay 1986; Kennedy et al. 1990; dos Santos
1998). Because males are generally taller than females, males tend to have a greater
stroke length compared with females when swimming at the same race pace.
Hand Pathway
McCabe, Psycharakis, and Sanders (2011) and McCabe and Sanders (2012)
found that swimmers use a similar hand pathway both in terms of maximum

Freestyle Technique 33
vertical (depth) and maximum lateral (width) displacement across swim paces
(approximately 0.66 and 0.39 meters, respectively). But the time when these
events occur within the stroke cycle depends on the swim pace. For example,
the maximum depth of the middle finger occurred approximately 10 percent
later within the stroke cycle at a distance pace compared with the sprint pace
(figure 2.5). McCabe (2008) reasoned that the later obtainment of maximum
depth was most likely caused by the prolonged duration of the entry phase (10
percent) when distance swimming compared with sprint swimming.
Swimmers have a deeper average pull path when swimming at a distance pace
than when sprinting (figure 2.6). The average range of lateral displacement of
the finger also tends to be greater at distance pace than when sprinting (figure
2.6). Because upper-limb displacement has been related to the magnitude of
body roll (Lui, Hay, and Andrews 1993; Hay, Lui, and Andrews 1993; Payton
and Mullineaux 1996), it is reasoned that the increased magnitude of shoulder
and hip roll at distance pace accounts for these differences.

Elbow Angle
The elbow angle in swimming has received attention by researchers because
of its associated influence on the arm trajectory (Hay, Lui, and Andrews 1993)
and links to the efficiency and power of the applied propulsive force by the arm
during the underwater stroke cycle (Counsilman 1973; Colwin 1977; Deschodt,
Rouard, and Monteil 1996; Cappaert 1998; Haffner and Cappaert 1998). At the
instant the hand enters the water, the elbow is more extended when sprinting

than when distance swimming (figure 2.7). When sprinting, swimmers enter
with the arm extended to enable a quick transition from entry to catch so that
they can maximize the time of applying propulsive force. When swimming at a
distance pace, swimmers extend the elbow after entry to glide the hand forward
so that they can adopt a streamlined gliding posture and have an economical
and sustainable stroke rate.
At the catch position (the moment when the hand initiates a backward move-
ment following hand entry), the elbow angle does not vary by swim pace. Swim-
mers typically have an elbow angle of 152 degrees at this position, irrespective
of swim speed. As the hand continues to travel backward and becomes vertically
aligned with the shoulder (transition from pull to push phase), the elbow angle
does not differ between swim paces and is typically about 103 degrees (figure 2.7).
McCabe, Psycharakis, and Sanders (2011) and McCabe and Sanders (2012)
revealed that the magnitude of the elbow angle at the instant when the hand
stops moving backward (end of push phase) and the range of elbow angle within
the push phase were greater by approximately 7 degrees when swimmers were
sprinting compared with when they were swimming at a distance pace (figure
2.7). The elbow angle at the end of the push phase is a measure of elbow extension
at the end of what is regarded as the most propulsive phase of the underwater
stroke cycle. Therefore, the greater range of motion within the push phase when
sprinting may contribute to greater generation of propulsion during the push
phase compared with distance swimming.

Stroke Phase Duration
The swimming stroke cycle is typically divided into four distinct phases: entry,
pull, push, and recovery. This process allows us to compare phase durations of
various swim strokes and is an effective tool for coaches and teachers to assess the

development of technique (Wiegand, Wuensch, and Jaehnig 1975). Phase dura-
tions are commonly expressed as a percentage of the total time of a stroke cycle.
Studies have shown that swimmers adjust the time spent in each of the stroke
phases to meet the physiological and performance objectives of the event distance
(Chollet, Chalies, and Chatard 2000; Millet et al. 2002; Lerda and Cardelli 2003;
Seifert, Chollet, and Brady 2004; Seifert, Boulesteix, and Chollet 2004; Seifert,
Chollet, and Rouard 2007). Sprint swimming is characterized by a shorter entry
phase and longer pull, push, and recovery phases in comparison with distance
swimming (figure 2.8). This structure of the stroke cycle results in longer appli-
cation of propulsive forces (Millet et al. 2002; Lerda and Cardelli 2003; Colwin
1969; Duclos, Legreneur, and Monteil 2002; McCabe, Psycharakis, and Sanders
2011; McCabe and Sanders 2012). The longer relative time in the entry phase
when swimming at distance pace supports the idea that at this pace, swimmers
adopt this style to improve the hydrodynamic position of the body, reduce the
stroke rate, and improve the economy of swimming (Keskinen and Komi 1993;
Chollet, Chalies, and Chatard 2000; Lerda and Cardelli 2003).
Within the underwater stroke cycle, the occurrence of the catch position also
occurs at different instances relative to the swim pace. Because the catch occurs
at the end of the entry phase, figure 2.8 indicates that swimmers made the catch
at approximately 30 percent and 40 percent of the stroke cycle for sprint and
distance swimming, respectively.
Researchers have investigated the coordination between the arms throughout
the stroke cycle based on the duration of the stroke phases: entry A, pull B, push
C, and recovery D (figure 2.9). Chollet, Chalies, and Chatard (2000) developed
the index of coordination (IdC) as a tool to quantify the relationship between
the arms when swimming freestyle in a standardized manner. This index is

based on quantifying the lag time between the start of propulsion by one arm
and the end of propulsion by the other.
Lag time 1 (TL1) was defined as the time between the beginning of propul-
sion in the first right-arm stroke and the end of propulsion in the first left-arm
stroke (figure 2.10). Lag time 2 (TL2) was defined as the beginning of propulsion
in the second left-arm stroke and the end of propulsion in the first right-arm
stroke (figure 2.10). These lag times were then expressed as a percentage of mean
duration of a stroke cycle, resulting in IdC1 and IdC2 respectively. Figure 2.10
shows that the IdC was the mean of these two indices (TL1 + TL2).
Using this measure Chollet, Chalies, and Chatard (2000) identified three
modes of freestyle swimming:
1. catch-up, which is lag time between the propulsive phases of two arms
(IdC < 0);
2. opposition, described as propulsive actions whereby one arm begins to pull
while the other is finishing the push (IdC = 0); and,
3. superposition, described as an overlap of the propulsive phases (IdC > 0).

To test this new tool, Chollet, Chalies, and Chatard (2000) examined the rela-
tionship between 44 French national division swimmers, swimming at 800-meter,
100-meter, and 50-meter pace. It was found that IdC increased with swim velocity.
That is, at 800-meter pace, swimmers displayed a catch-up style, whereas at 100-
meter and 50-meter pace, opposition style was prevalent. The best swimmers
displayed a superposition between the arms at 50-meter pace.
Other researchers have adopted this tool to examine freestyle coordination
between elite swimmers and triathletes (Millet et al. 2002), with gender adapta-
tion (Seifert, Boulesteix, and Chollet 2002; Seifert, Chollet, and Rouard 2007;
Seifert et al. 2010), on the effect of swim velocity (Lerda and Cardelli 2003;
McCabe 2008), during exhaustive exercise (Alberty et al. 2002), and on the
effect of breathing and skill level (Lerda and Cardelli 2003; Seifert, Chollet,
and Allard 2005).
These studies produced the following conclusions:
• Swimmers and triathletes adapt their stroke patterns from a catch-up style
to an opposition style when changing from long-distance pace to maximum
sprint pace. This change resulted in a decrease in entry phase duration and
an increase in pull and push phases, thereby creating longer propulsive
forces (Millet et al. 2002; Lerda and Cardelli 2003).
• Men change from catch-up to opposition spontaneously at a critical veloc-
ity and stroke frequency corresponding to 100-meter pace (1.8 meters per
second) and 40 strokes per minute. Women adopt their pattern progres-
sively (Seifert, Chollet, and Brady 2004; Seifert, Chollet, and Rouard 2007).
• A critical change of coordination occurred at the 100-meter pace relative to
swimming at a distance pace. This finding was explained by the fact that the
sample subjects were sprint specialists who changed to a preferred pattern
at the 100-meter pace (Seifert, Chollet, and Brady 2004).
• Only the best male performers can adopt a superposition stroke pattern
when maximally sprinting (Lerda and Cardelli 2003; Seifert, Boulesteix,
and Chollet 2002; Seifert, Chollet, and Rouard 2007).
• Top performers demonstrate a shorter push phase during all swim paces,
resulting in greater acceleration of the hand during this phase (Lerda and
Cardelli 2003).
• Skilled and less-skilled swimmers illustrate changes in breathing pattern at
different velocities (Lerda and Cardelli, 2003).
• Elite swimmers show no change in arm coordination when breathing. Sub-
elite swimmers change arm coordination when breathing (Seifert, Chollet,
and Allard 2005).
Table 2.1 presents quantitative data from previous studies with regard to
the duration of each stroke phase and the coordination index. To enhance the
meaningfulness of the data, only values in relation to sprint or distance swim-
ming are presented.

Shoulder and Hip Roll
Distance swimming is characterized by greater rotation of the shoulders com-
pared with sprint swimming (Castro et al. 2002; McCabe and Sanders 2012).
Researchers have proposed that this action reduces the frontal surface area and
consequently minimizes active drag (Cappaert, Pease, and Troup 1995; Cappaert
1998; Castro et al., 2002). Cappaert, Pease, and Troup (1995) proposed that
reducing the difference in magnitudes of shoulder and hip roll would minimize
active drag. Studies have shown that the difference between total shoulder and
hip roll was less at distance pace (57 degrees) than in sprinting (68 degrees)—in
other words, the body rolls more as a unit—confirming that swimmers adopt a
more streamlined or improved hydrodynamic body position when swimming
at distance pace.
Researchers have proposed that an increase in shoulder roll with increasing race
distance is because of a longer entry phase (Cappaert 1998; Castro et al. 2002).
Thus, the high stroke frequency associated with sprinting does not enable as great
a body roll to be achieved because of the reduced time available to roll. Further,
an increase in duration of the entry phase, longer stroke length, and reduced
stroke frequency have been related to better economy in distance swimming in
comparison with sprinting. But the reduction in economy in sprinting because
of reduced body roll is offset by the advantage gained by increasing propulsive
force and stroke frequency (Costill, Maglischo, and Richardson 1992; Cappaert
1998; Chollet, Chalies, and Chatard 2000; Seifert, Chollet, and Brady 2004).
These priorities are higher in sprinting because of the short duration of the event.
The magnitude of the maximum hip roll is also greater when swimming at
distance pace compared with sprint pace. The large difference in magnitude of hip
and shoulder roll further supports the independency of the hips and shoulders in
that a change in one is not necessarily reflected in a proportional change in the
other. Indeed, McCabe and Sanders (2012) reported that the hip roll increased
by approximately 16 degrees when swimming at distance pace compared with
sprint pace, whereas the shoulder roll increased by only 5 degrees.

--- Page 50 Text ---

Freestyle Technique 39
It has also been proposed that the magnitude of the kicking action may con-
tribute to the change of hip rotation between paces because of the generated
torques about the longitudinal axis. The suggestion was that hip rotation is
dampened when sprinting because of the vigorous action of the leg kick (Yanai,
2001; Sanders and Psycharakis 2009). Although not always statistically signifi-
cant, swimmers tend to kick with reduced amplitude during distance events
relative to sprint events (Cappaert 1998; McCabe 2008). In distance events,
swimmers may not produce torques as powerful as those they produce in sprint
swimming, permitting them to increase hip rotation during this pace (Sanders
and Psycharakis 2009). It is suggested that the magnitude of the kicking action
may determine the degree of hip roll and consequently the degree of shoulder
roll in swim paces.
This discussion raises the issue of the timing to attain maximum shoulder
and hip roll. Studies have reported that swimmers reached maximum hip roll to
both sides later in the stroke cycle when swimming at distance pace compared
with swimming at sprint pace (figure 2.11). The longer time to reach maximum
rotation of the hips at distance pace may be related to the reduced vertical kick-
ing displacement of the feet at this pace. It is assumed that the kick is not as
aggressive when distance swimming and therefore that the torques produced
from the leg kick are diminished in comparison with sprinting, resulting in a
longer period to obtain maximum hip rotation at distance pace.

Kicking Action
The magnitude of the kicking action has been linked to the change of many
variables between paces, as presented previously. But the primary purpose of a
greater foot vertical displacement when sprinting is to increase propulsion (Wilke
1992; Deschodt, Arsac, and Rouard 1999; Maglischo 2003). Swimmers tend to

}

decrease the foot vertical range during periods of distance swimming, which
consequently produces less propulsive force than the kicking action in sprint
swimming but may be advantageous in terms of reducing the frontal surface
area and minimizing active drag.
Differences Between Sprint and Distance Swimmers
at the Same Pace
Although sprint and distance swimming are clearly different, it is uncertain
whether sprint specialists and distance specialists need to be taught different
techniques. A coach of an age-group swimmer might ask, “Do I need to teach
different techniques to the sprinters and distance swimmers?” or “Given the
difficulty of changing technique as the technique becomes automated through
years of repetitive practice, do I need to encourage early distance specialization
and fine-tune the swimmers’ techniques to suit their specialist events? Or do
swimmers spontaneously adjust their technique in an appropriate way when
they change pace?”
These issues were addressed by analyzing both sprint and distance special-
ists at both sprint (McCabe, Psycharakis, and Sanders 2011) and distance paces
(McCabe and Sanders 2012). The results for both groups found that swimmers
adjust their technique automatically for the event distance. That is, when sprinters
swim at a distance pace they swim like distance swimmers, and when distance
swimmers swim at a sprint pace they swim like sprinters. The important implica-
tion for coaches is that they do not need to encourage early specialization and
they do not need to coach different techniques to swimmers at an early age in
anticipation of their specializing in particular event distances.
Tables 2.2 and 2.3 show that differences between sprint and distance swim-
mers when swimming at sprint pace and distance pace respectively were small
and not significant for many variables analyzed by McCabe, Psycharakis, and
Sanders (2011). Only the duration of the pull phase, which is shorter for sprinters
than for distance swimmers, and the occurrence of peak shoulder roll (left and
right sides), in which sprinters reach the maximal shoulder roll later within the
stroke cycle compared with distance swimmers, were significantly different when
both groups swam at a sprint pace. Although the explanation for the difference
in shoulder roll is unclear, the difference in duration of the pull phase can be
explained readily by strength differences between the groups. Sprint swimmers
tend to be stronger, so they can pull against the resistance of the water at faster
speeds than the distance swimmers can.
The only variable that was significantly different between sprint and distance
swimmers when swimming at a distance pace was swim velocity (table 2.3). It
was found that distance swimmers were able to maintain a greater swim velocity
throughout the 400 meters compared with sprint swimmers.
McCabe, Psycharakis, and Sanders (2011) and McCabe and Sanders (2012)
found that swimmers are not significantly different in most stroke characteristics.

These findings challenge current views with regard to freestyle sprint and distance
swimmers. Coaches should be aware, however, that they do differ in terms of
the duration of the pull phase, the timing of the maximum stroke width and
maximum shoulder roll angle when sprinting, and the average swim speed
when distance swimming. Consequently, coaches should include specific drills
to develop these characteristics and emphasize them throughout the training
session. Otherwise, coaches can be confident that sprint and distance swimmers
are not as different in terms of technique as once suspected.
Changes in Technique Due to Fatigue
Fatigue is defined as the inability to sustain exercise at a required pace or inten-
sity (Alberty et al. 2009). Fatigue in swimming develops during a race and can

affect technique and coordination, particularly toward the final stages of the race.
Besides reducing capacity to generate propulsive force, fatigue induces changes in
technical proficiency, posture, and coordination, which can increase resistance
(Alberty et al. 2009, 2011; Potts, Charlton, and Smith 2002; Seifert et al. 2010).
Therefore, swimmers must learn to minimize these effects and hold form as
much as possible.
Thow (2010) identified a battery of technique and coordination variables in
freestyle swimming that change significantly because of fatigue. In this study,
fatigue was induced by instructing 10 Scottish national-level swimmers to
perform a series of repeated 100-meter max effort freestyle swims (rest 30 sec-
onds) until their 100-meter time exceeded 125 percent of the best time relative
to their personal best. The results highlighted that fatigue causes swimmers to
alter their technique. In particular, swimmers do not maintain limb positions

corresponding to good form in freestyle swimming when they become fatigued.
This result reflects strength deficiencies of particular muscle groups. For example,
increased arm recovery width reflects an inability to maintain a high elbow and
may indicate deficiencies in muscles used to rotate the shoulders externally
(Pollard and Fernandez 2004).
In Thow’s (2010) study, changes with fatigue included increased shoulder roll
and change in body angle, that is, lower-leg position. These alterations are known
to increase resistance (Maglischo 2003; Sweetenham and Atkinson 2003). Given
that fatigue affects technique, an additional concern is that if swimmers con-
tinually perform under a fatigued state during training, adaptations may result
in incorrect muscle development, imbalances, and increased injury risk (Becker
and Havriluk 2006; Brukner and Khan 2006; Grace 1985). The identification of
poor or incorrect technique patterns before they become automatic in nature
is imperative to maintain peak performance and prevent strength and postural
imbalances that reduce performance and increase the risk of injury.
Training for Freestyle Swimming
General training principles are well established in various swimming texts, such
as Maglischo’s Swimming Fastest: The Essential Reference on Technique, Training, and
Program Design (2003). In this section we look at differences resulting from event
specialization with particular emphasis on event distance. We also look at how
training must consider the different needs of sprint and distance swimmers.
Considering the Needs of Distance Specialists
Swimmers who are suited to longer events such as 1,500-meter freestyle are
those endowed with good potential for developing the aerobic contribution to
. .
performance, that is, VOmax. A high VOmax in combination with fewer fast-
2 2
twitch fibers that are producing large amounts of lactic acid means that distance
swimmers can sustain fast speeds without suffering severe lactic acidosis.
Elite long-distance swimmers tend to have a high percentage of slow-twitch
fibers relative to fast-twitch fibers compared with sprint swimmers and do not
tend to develop great muscle bulk through training. Another characteristic
common to distance swimmers is that they don’t rely on a strong kick and may
have a somewhat lazy kick of inconsistent rhythm that is not especially vigorous.
Rather than providing propulsion, the kick is used to maintain good balance
and streamlining. This is not to say that development of a strong six-beat kick is
not advantageous to distance swimmers. They often use bursts of strong six-beat
kicking to burn off an opponent and to bring the race home.
Because of their high aerobic capacity and preponderance of fatigue-resistant
slow-twitch fibers, distance swimmers can tolerate high training volumes at
relatively fast speeds (Maglischo 2003). Their lactate threshold pace tends to
be faster than that of swimmers of equivalent ability in shorter events. Because
slow-twitch fibers use muscle glycogen at a slower rate than fast-twitch fibers

--- Page 55 Text ---

do and because slow-twitch fibers are more capable of metabolizing alternative
fuels such as glucose and fat, distance swimmers can swim longer before they
deplete their glycogen reserves.
Speed can be maintained over a long distance only if the metabolism is
.
predominantly aerobic. Therefore, distance swimmers need a high VOmax
2
and associated high anaerobic threshold pace. Thus, training is geared toward
development of aerobic capacity rather than anaerobic capacity.
Lactate tolerance training is not important for distance swimmers. Overload
endurance training and race-pace training should have less emphasis than in
the training programs of specialists in shorter events. But distance swimmers do
need to be able to maintain swimming speed and anaerobic power to bring the
race home. They also need to be able to buffer the lactate buildup that occurs by
swimming above threshold in a race, particularly in the final stages of the race.
The ability to buffer lactate is developed through overload endurance training
and race-pace endurance training.
Considering the Needs of Middle-Distance
Specialists
Middle-distance events include 200-meter and 400-meter freestyle. These
swimmers are all-rounders in terms of their physiological endowment. They
have both good aerobic power and good anaerobic power. Thus, they have the
entire physical package that allows them to swim fast for the duration of these
events. They have a balance of fast-twitch and slow-twitch fibers, although pos-
sibly slightly more slow-twitch fibers than fast-twitch fibers (Maglischo 2003).
Although not as explosive as sprint swimmers, they have the ability to start and
finish fast across the distances in which they compete.
Middle-distance swimmers respond well to both endurance and sprint train-
ing. But because of their higher percentage of fast-twitch fibers, they are more
susceptible to fatigue and depletion of glycogen. Consequently, they cannot
perform the same quantity of endurance training as distance swimmers can,
particularly at threshold and overload training speeds. They also require more
recovery time to replace the glycogen in their muscles.
Middle-distance freestyle swimmers require a strong six-beat kick, although
they may adopt a more relaxed two-beat or four-beat rhythm during the middle
of the race. The training program for middle-distance freestyle swimmers empha-
sizes development of aerobic capacity through the first two-thirds of the season
and maintenance through the remainder of the season as the focus shifts to
the development of anaerobic power and buffering capacity through overload
endurance training and race-pace training (Maglischo 2003).
Lactate tolerance training is not typically emphasized with this group of
swimmers unless they also compete in 100-meter events. Similarly, speed is
maintained primarily through technique development rather than development
of muscle strength and power.

Freestyle Technique 45
Considering the Needs of Sprint Specialists
Sprint events include 50-meter and 100-meter freestyle. The physical makeup
of those who perform best at 50 meters can be quite different from those who
perform best at 100 meters. Those who excel at 50 meters but drop off in the 100
meters generally do so because they have a large percentage of fast-twitch fibers.
They have high levels of muscle power and anaerobic power but limited aerobic
power when expressed as a percentage of body weight (Maglischo 2003). They
have more muscle bulk in general and more muscle made up of fast-twitch fibers.
Those who perform well at 100 meters have a more balanced percentage of
fast- and slow-twitch fibers. They have higher aerobic power and high anaero-
bic power, although less than that of those who excel over 50 meters. Because
sprinters also tend to have more muscle bulk than middle-distance swimmers
and a higher percentage of fast-twitch fibers, their aerobic capacity expressed
per unit of body weight is generally less than that of middle-distance swimmers
although greater than that of 50-meter sprinters.
Because of their high percentage of fast-twitch fibers, sprinters tend to improve
muscle size and strength more easily than middle- and long-distance swimmers
do. The kick contributes more to speed in freestyle sprint events than it does
in middle- and long-distance events. Thus, sprint swimmers need to develop a
powerful six-beat kick.
Because they have a large number of fast-twitch fibers, sprinters are prone to
rapid accumulation of lactic acid as well as rapid depletion of glycogen stores
in the muscles. Thus, they are not suited to train fast for long distances or to
perform long-distance repeats with short rest intervals. This is particularly the
case for those who are best at 50-meter sprints but drop off the pace in 100-
meter sprints.
When doing basic endurance and threshold sets, they need to swim at a slower
pace and with slower heart rates than middle-distance and distance swimmers
do. They also need more recovery swimming to replace glycogen and clear the
lactate. Although they can cope with paces of overload endurance training in a
similar manner to middle-distance and distance swimmers, those whose best
distance is 50 meters in particular tend to struggle to maintain the pace for
long cumulative distances in overload sets. The overall training volume should
be less for sprint swimmers than for middle-distance and distance swimmers.
Dryland Training for Freestyle Swimmers
The primary aim of land training for swimmers is to prepare the athlete physi-
cally to train and compete. The goal of land programs is to develop strength
and endurance in the muscles to the levels required for optimal performance.
This includes ensuring good posture for swimming and appropriate balance
among the muscle groups in strength and endurance. Because athletes differ in
anthropometric (body shape) and physiological makeup, the training program
must be individualized to ensure optimal physical preparation for each swimmer.

Maintaining Muscle Balance and Good Posture
Because of the cyclical nature of the swim strokes and the large volumes of train-
ing, swimmers are prone to postural problems. These postures can be both a
cause and effect of musculoskeletal imbalances. The imbalances and postures
can lead to injury as well as limit swimming performance. An example of this
issue is tight hip flexors that pull the pelvis into anterior tilt. This problem can
affect the ability of the pelvis to get into full hip extension, which is important
in performing correct movement patterns in starts and turns. The anterior tilt
may also affect the swimmer’s ability to adopt streamlined positions in the water
and is likely to reduce the efficiency and effectiveness of muscles involved in
swimming motions, including those of the arms, head, trunk, and lower limbs.
The upper-limb motions in freestyle involve strong internal rotation and
extension of the shoulders. Specific adaptations occur in muscles such as the
deltoids, pectorals, and latissimus dorsi. These muscles (agonist muscles) will
adapt favorably to the volume of swim training by becoming stronger and
gaining in endurance. But the muscles that provide the opposite movements
(antagonist muscles) such as the trapezius, infraspinatus, and supraspinatus do
not develop strength and endurance to the same level. Consequently, postural
problems occur, so the athlete is unable to adopt the streamlined position that
minimizes resistive drag.
Understanding Movement Patterns
Before prescribing effective land program interventions, coaches need to under-
stand basic muscle mechanics. The actions of the shoulders are crucial in all
swimming strokes. The scapula plays a pivotal role. It is the largest bone in the
shoulder complex and has the greatest number of muscles attached to it. These
muscles are responsible for providing stability as well as moving the arm. Any
altered scapular function arising from muscular weakness or fatigue, including
inability to position or stabilize the scapula properly, directly affects swimming
performance and increases the risk of injury. Table 2.4 provides a basis for iden-
tifying the muscles involved in the movements in swimming and for selecting
exercises in a dryland program to ensure appropriate muscle balance for swim-
mers. All these muscles are important in swimming and in maintaining proper
shoulder function, so they should be trained appropriately.

Chapter 18, “Sports Medicine: Swimming Injuries and Prevention,” and chap-
ter 20, “Strength and Conditioning for Performance Enhancement,” present some
practical guidelines for preventing injury and developing swimming-specific
strength. Here are some practical guidelines to help you plan your strength and
conditioning program to maximize performance in freestyle swimming.
When possible, combine the individual movements listed in table 2.4 when
performing strengthening exercises. An example is the bench press, in which
the shoulder is internally rotated with scapular protraction and elevation during
the concentric phase of the movement.
Always incorporate balance into your program. In the bench press example,
include an exercise such as rowing to maintain strength balance in the rotator
cuff (external rotation) and around the scapula (scapular retraction).
Selection of appropriate sets and number of repetitions for exercise balance is
another key consideration. For example, doing resistance-band work for scapular
retraction and shoulder external rotation is not sufficient as a stimulus to counter-
act the high volume of shoulder internal rotation movements in the pool. Thus,
in land training, higher volumes and loading are essential. Inclusion of loaded
exercises such as dumbbell rows and other loaded variations is appropriate.
During training periods in which high volumes of work are done in the pool,
consider increasing the volume of dryland work that is focused on scapular retrac-
tion and shoulder external rotation while decreasing work done in exercises like
the bench press and overhead press that replicate the shoulder internal rotation
movements done in the pool.
Regression in certain exercises can result from weaknesses in the opposing
muscle groups, which may not allow stabilization of muscle groups to exert force.
An example of this occurs among athletes who struggle to perform pull-ups. The
scapula may wing upward because of lack of strength in the lower trapezius to
stabilize the scapula. Consequently, a reduction occurs in transmission of force
through the latissimus dorsi and other musculature.
Care in performing exercises that mimic freestyle stroke patterns is essential
because this work can increase the adaptation stimulus that is already dominant
in pool training. The resulting strength imbalance can adversely affect posture
and increase the risk of injury. A more efficient method of developing stroke-
specific strength is through in-water resisted training because this work satisfies
all the neurophysiological and mechanical demands for transfer in accordance
with the principle of specificity.
Movements of the Hips and Lower Limbs
The musculature of the hips and lower limbs enables generation of propulsion
through kicking. Understanding the muscles and the movements that they
initiate is essential in designing land programs to help develop the strength of
the musculature. Table 2.5 provides a basic overview of the movements of the
hips and lower limbs and the muscles involved. The next stage is to identify
appropriate exercises to strengthen the movements.

--- Page 59 Text ---

48 Sanders and McCabe
Table 2.5 Muscles Involved in the Motions of the Hips and Lower Limbs
Movement Primary muscles involved
Hip flexion Psoas major and minor, rectus femoris
Hip extension Gluteus maximus, biceps femoris
Hip external rotation Gluteus medius, piriformis
Hip internal rotation Tensor fasciae latae, gluteus minimus
Hip adduction Adductor magnus, adductor brevis, adductor longus
Hip abduction Tensor fasciae latae, gluteus minimus
Knee flexion Biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus
Knee extension Rectus femoris, vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius
Ankle plantar flexion Gastrocnemius, soleus
Ankle dorsiflexion Tibialis anterior
As with the muscles of the upper limbs, the muscles of the lower limbs com-
bine to perform a variety of movements working in an eccentric, concentric, and
isometric fashion to provide the movement. Careful selection of training exercises
can stimulate multiple muscle groups. For example, squatting variations stress
all the lower-limb movements used in starts and turns, whereas squat jumps,
Olympic lifts, and pull variations involve the ankle musculature and develop a
power component of the leg musculature.
Ensuring balance in exercise selection and strength of muscle groups is essen-
tial to reducing risk of developing imbalances and injury.
Train movements, not muscles. Muscles work in synergy to provide move-
ment. The hamstrings not only perform knee flexion but also work to extend
the hip. Exercises that train those movements are more efficient than those that
isolate muscle groups.
Core Training
The use of core musculature to transfer forces across extremities is an important
factor in all sporting actions, particularly in swimming, because of the environ-
ment in which the sport is performed. Freestyle swimmers need to develop a
strong trunk musculature to maintain optimal posture so that they can transfer
forces and achieve a streamlined posture.
Movements of the Trunk Musculature
Traditional trunk training methods have been challenged by the findings of recent
research. Previous training interventions that encouraged spinal flexion have been
discouraged because of the effects on low-back health and its encouragement of
a kyphotic posture. A more recent trend is to build stability through the trunk
musculature in order to build endurance in specific postures and help steer forces
to the extremities while encouraging mobility through the hips and shoulders.
For the swimmer, this approach implies reducing the amount of movements that
encourage spinal flexion and implementing exercises that encourage thoracic
extension while challenging stability through the trunk musculature (table 2.6).

Freestyle Technique 49
Table 2.6 Muscles Involved in the Motions of the Trunk
Movement Primary muscles involved
Lumbar flexion Rectus abdominis
Lateral flexion External oblique, internal oblique
Lumber extension Erector spinae
Spinal rotation External oblique, internal oblique
Suitable exercises include static holds known as plank or bridge variations,
such as plank, side plank, and back bridge. These low-level trunk exercises pro-
mote the development of stability through the trunk musculature by building
endurance in an optimal posture. These exercises can be progressed by changing
stance width to increase the demand on the trunk musculature.
After stability is developed, velocity-specific training can be introduced through
medicine ball training to encourage higher force, high-velocity movements that
increase the stimulus to trunk musculature and develop of speed and power.
Effect of Muscle Flexibility on Posture
As muscles develop strength, flexibility can be affected for two reasons. First, the
increased pull of the muscle on the joint changes the resting position of the articu-
lating components of the skeleton. That is, a change in posture occurs. Second,
the muscles themselves can shorten, reducing their range of motion. Therefore,
training that results in changes in strength of muscles must be accompanied
by work to maintain flexibility. This point is particularly important in freestyle
swimming because the shoulders, in particular, and the hips and spine must be
able to move through a large range of motion with minimal internal resistance.
The muscles that commonly tend to be dominant within the swimming popu-
lation are usually located within the anterior chain, that is, the muscles on the
front of the body. Some of the muscles that make up the anterior chain are the
anterior deltoid, pectoralis major and minor, latissimus dorsi, and hip flexors and
rectus femoris. These muscles tend to be tight and strong, whereas the muscles of
the posterior chain such as the gluteals, hamstrings, and calf muscles tend to be
short and less strong. This situation arises from the swimming actions that favor
the anterior muscles.
The identification of targeted interventions that focus on developing the flex-
ibility of the dominant muscles while strengthening the opposing muscle groups
is key to reducing musculoskeletal dysfunction and improving performance. An
example of this would be doing flexibility work on the pectorals and latissimus
muscle groups and doing strength work on the opposing muscle groups such as
the lower trapezius and rhomboids.
When implementing flexibility interventions, keep these guidelines in mind:
• Prepool dynamic and PNF stretching (contract–relax and other variations)
are appropriate interventions to change muscle length and prepare the body
before performance.

--- Page 61 Text ---
}
50 Sanders and McCabe
• Postpool static stretching is appropriate. This stretching will have a relaxant
effect on the nervous system, but it is not appropriate as a prepool exercise
when an increase in nervous system activation is required.
• During periods of high-volume pool training, increase the focus on flex-
ibility to maintain range of movement within safe ranges to reduce the risk
of injury. Placing extra emphasis on pre- and postpool flexibility and mobil-
ity work as well as monitoring flexibility of individual athletes is essential.
• Each stroke has its own flexibility challenges. The breaststroke kick chal-
lenges the leg muscles, especially the adductor muscle groups, whereas
backstroke and fly challenge shoulder and latissimus muscle groups. Con-
sider the stroke and its demands and create a flexibility program specific to
each swimmer and her events.
• A strength program that encourages lifting through a full range of move-
ment is also essential to developing strength through the full range and
maintaining flexibility in movements.
Summary
In this chapter we explored three facets of competitive freestyle swimming. In
the first section we established the importance of rhythm and the role of body
roll as the rhythm generator. The swimming actions and the elements of sound
technique were linked to the goals of maintaining good rhythm and streamlined
alignment to optimize swimming efficiency and minimize resistive forces.
In the second section we described differences and similarities in technique
between distance and sprint swimming. These topics included comparison
of sprint and distance swimming in terms of the standard race parameters of
stroke length, stroke frequency, and swimming speed followed by comparison
of observable technique features such as hand paths and elbow angles. Timing
and coordination were considered in terms of phase durations and patterns of
shoulder and hip roll. We also explored differences between distance and sprint
swimmers swimming at the same pace. Surprisingly or not, these two species
of swimmer display few differences when swimming at the same pace. The
important implication is that coaches don’t need to encourage early specializa-
tion of swimming distance and technique training. The section concluded with
a discussion of how fatigue might affect technique.
The third part of the chapter provided information about the general prin-
ciples of training for front crawl swimming and the different training needs of
sprint, middle-distance, and distance swimmers. The section concluded with
a discussion of principles of dryland training, emphasizing the importance of
maintaining good muscle balance to optimize performance and minimize the
risk of injury.

his input on the section on dryland training.

CHAPTER
Backstroke Technique
—Russell Mark
Backstroke technique, as with all the competitive strokes, has seen an evolution
of sorts over the past decade. We are seeing many of today’s top backstrokers
adopting common characteristics in their techniques. A number of the methods
being used by the best in the world challenge teachings that were provided to
swimmers only a generation ago.
Stroke technique analysis and instruction may be done in several ways. Each
has its strong points and flaws. First, the ideal stroke can be created by using
the laws of physics, our understanding of fluid dynamics, and complex mod-
eling techniques and then teaching that ideal stroke to swimmers. Although
this method may have a strong foundation in the sciences, in many cases these
approaches gloss over the applied side of swimming—the way in which athletes
actually execute the technique in the water. Additionally, these types of methods
often present data in ways that are not intuitive to a swimmer.
Second, we can watch what the best in the world are doing and then try to
explain why those swimmers are successful; we outline the kinematics of the
movements and teach others to swim the same way. This is the “Michael Phelps
swims this way, so you should swim this way too” approach. The best in the
world are always innovative and push the envelope faster and farther than those
who use a pure scientific approach. But this method overlooks the fact that all
swimmers are different and that the things that work so well for one swimmer
may not be best for another. This approach also runs the risk that a coach does
not fully understand why certain things work to make a swimmer faster, which
is certainly information required for effective coaching.
The third, and arguably best, approach to analyzing and prescribing technique
is to combine the first two methods by critically analyzing the techniques used
by the best in the world but interpreting those techniques through the laws of
51

science and fluid dynamics, explaining why those methods produce faster times
and reduce injury risk, and tweaking techniques to match the characteristics
of the individual swimmer. This approach does not get deep into the numbers,
but it matches observation with science and often presents information in a way
that intuitively makes sense.
This chapter uses this third approach. The characteristics of the techniques of
the best backstrokers in the world are presented and then explained using what
is known about generating propulsion and reducing drag to provide guidelines
for teaching the mechanics of a fast and safe backstroke. Some ideas fall in line
with conventional teachings, but others challenge traditional thinking and
present new ideas about backstroke mechanics and the achievement of speed.
Use of Video as a Foundation
for Stroke Analysis
Underwater training and competition video of the best backstrokers has become
increasingly available since the early 2000s and provides today’s coaches and
athletes with unique insights into how the top backstrokers swim so fast. One
of the surprising insights gained after engaging in intensive video analysis is that
the techniques used by elite backstrokers have many qualities in common and
definitely trend toward a common, optimal technique. The development and
understanding of this ideal technique and the components that contribute to it is
the focus of the chapter.
The technique presented in this chapter is both derived and validated from video
evidence. Real athletes, including Aaron Peirsol, Natalie Coughlin, Kirsty Coventry,
Ryan Lochte, Missy Franklin, Michael Phelps, Camille LaCourt, Margaret Hoelzer,
Tyler Clary, Emily Seebohm, and Elizabeth Beisel, swim with great success using
the techniques described. Additionally, the technique makes sense from a scientific
and theoretical standpoint. Science and the potential of the human body say that
this technique will succeed.
A particular focus of this chapter is to explain why this technique leads to suc-
cess because that level of understanding makes each concept more convincing
and powerful. The many aspects that make up the overall stroke will be explained
separately and sequentially because that is the easiest way to explain concepts in
written form. In action and reality, the stroke typically isn’t thought of as follow-
ing from step-by-step instructions; instead, each element flows seamlessly into the
next and makes for one elegant, smooth motion. Each part of the stroke is directly
related to all the others. The effective backstroke coach needs to understand those
relationships and the integration of all the movements as well as the mechanics
of the individual pieces themselves.
As with all strokes, individual swimmers will display minor variations from the
ideal technique to account for their unique characteristics, and some swimmers will
succeed despite unusual aspects of their techniques. A coach must keep the ideal
technique in mind and coach the majority of athletes toward that model while also

Backstroke Technique 53
being mindful that a person’s physical strengths and traits could lead to unique
technical aspects. These exceptions, along with common and older teachings that
differ, will also be touched on because the complete picture of what the stroke
should look like, what the stroke can look like, what many people think the stroke
looks like, and what the stroke used to look like are all important.
Overview of the Backstroke
Swimming the backstroke can be likened to paddling a kayak or raft. The head
and body represent the boat, the arms are the oars, and the legs are a propeller
at the rear of the craft. To move through the water as swiftly and efficiently as
possible, the body (boat) must be firm and steady. The legs (rear propeller) should
be constantly motoring to assist in propulsion and stability through the core.
The arms (oars) provide most of the propulsion. Like boat oars, propulsion from
the arms is rather simple—push water in a straight path back toward the rear of
the boat (or the feet in swimming) to move forward. Additionally, the surface
area of the hand and forearm (oar) should be as large as possible to apply direct
force toward the feet. This type of propulsion in swimming has been referred
to in literature as drag-based or drag-dominant propulsion, as opposed to lift-
based or lift-dominant propulsion. The distinction of these terms is historically
significant because in the past backstroke technique was taught in a way that
primarily relied on lift forces to generate propulsion.
Let’s look at this in more detail because this concept is important for generat-
ing propulsion in backstroke. A swimmer always wants to generate force in the
backward direction (toward the feet) to move forward. To create the backward
forces, a swimmer has the option of producing drag forces or lift forces. Whether
a swimmer generates propulsive lift or drag is largely determined by the orienta-
tion of the hand and the way in which it moves through the water. Propulsive
drag occurs when the palm faces toward the feet and the arm moves backward to
create the propulsive force. Lift-dominant propulsion is created when the palm
pitches slightly downward or upward and the arm follows a curved downward or
upward path to create force in the backward direction. Lift forces are an indirect
way to generate backward force; drag forces are direct.
When they hear the word drag, many people think of resistance, something
that all swimmers should avoid when it works to slow down the body. But the
principles of drag can work to a swimmer’s advantage when he is attempting to
generate propulsion. As the hand and arm pull through the water, they experi-
ence drag, but this force helps push the body forward. The more resistance the
hands and arms experience, the greater the propulsive drag will be. With all
other things being equal, the swimmer will move faster through the water.
Understanding Lift Forces
In airplane flight, producing lift forces makes sense. The wing is specifically
shaped so that when it moves in a forward direction, it creates an upward (lift)

--- Page 65 Text ---
}
54 Mark
force perpendicular to the direction of the wing’s movement, allowing the plane
to leave the ground.
In swimming, lift forces do not make as much sense. A swimmer can pro-
duce lift forces, but the speed, size, and shape of the hand can never generate
enough lift force to have a significant effect on forward propulsion. Upward and
downward arm movements in backstroke (think of an S pull) can be observed
in nearly every swimmer’s stroke to some degree, but these movements are not
necessarily contributing to making the swimmer go faster. These extraneous
movements in backstroke can happen because of the body rotation that occurs
during every stroke. They may be due to an adjustment that the swimmer makes
to maintain the best backward arm movement and force generation. More likely,
they happen because the swimmer changes the angle of the hand to keep the
arms moving through the water as fast as possible. Although common, these
indirect movements are not what make the swimmer move forward.
The backstroke arm stroke should be just like a boat oar; the face of the paddle
pushes water directly back toward the feet. Propulsion from the backstroke
arm movement is based on grabbing hold of as much water as possible as early
in the stroke as possible and using the strongest muscles to push that water
straight back so that the swimmer can move forward. To achieve that goal, let’s
look deeper into the stroke mechanics, particularly what goes on underwater
to generate propulsion.
Underwater Phase of the Backstroke
A great catch is shallow and to the side of the body, pushes straight back through
the water, and follows through to the end with a downward finish. This state-
ment is important because as recently as the mid-2000s, a commonly accepted
(and taught) pull pattern for backstroke was to press the hand down as deeply as
possible during the catch, then bring the hand back up toward the surface, and
then flip the hand back over with a downward finish. The hand would go down,
up, and down, like the shape of a sideways letter S. The origin of this teaching is
uncertain, but it was widely accepted and was based on two premises—that lift
forces were important and that the initial part of the stroke needed to be deep
because the deeper water was better to pull against (more on that later). What’s
most surprising about the wide acceptance of this idea is that so many of the
best backstrokers in history, even going back to the mid-1970s and films shot
by Doc Counsilman, did not swim like that.
Because the underwater arm stroke has the greatest effect on propulsion and
speed, all other parts of the backstroke should be built to support the mechan-
ics and strength of that perfect underwater arm movement. Body rotation, head
position, body position, and kick are each important to overall performance
in the water, but taken separately, none of these elements can contribute near
as much to forward propulsion as the arm stroke. They can aid a swimmer in
achieving the best arm stroke when used correctly; when not used correctly,

--- Page 66 Text ---
|
Backstroke Technique 55
they can be detrimental to the arm stroke and overall performance. With this
in mind, a swimmer and coach must be careful about how each of those move-
ments is performed and emphasized and how they each contribute to overall
stroke performance. Let’s look in more detail at the various components that
make up the underwater stroke.

Among the pieces that make up the underwater arm stroke, the catch (figure 3.1)
is arguably the most critical aspect to fast and efficient swimming. Ultimately,
the catch determines how propulsive the entire arm stroke will be. The key ele-
ments to a good catch are to grab, or catch, a lot of water and to do it as early
as possible. The concepts of quantity and timing are inseparable. The sooner a
swimmer can grab hold of a lot of water, the better the entire arm stroke will be.
If a swimmer doesn’t catch water early, she won’t be able to catch a lot of water.
Conversely, if a swimmer does catch water early, she will also catch a lot of it,
and that arm stroke will likely be highly effective.
The catch is seen as the defining characteristic of the best swimmers at every
level, yet it can be the hardest and most elusive skill in backstroke to master.
Every aspect of the stroke must come together to produce a solid catch, and any
flaw in rotation, body position, or kick will negatively affect the stroke. At the
same time, a distinct, visible catch often translates into overall backstroke success.
The catch and underwater arm stroke start after the hand is fully submerged
after entry. One arm is extended above the head straight above the shoulder,
the pinky finger is pointed down toward the bottom of the pool, and the palm
is facing out. The body should be rotated just 30 degrees to the side of the hand
entering the water. The first movement is to bend at the wrist so that the finger-
tips point to the side and the palm faces back. The elbow bends in immediate
succession so that the entire arm moves laterally to the side. The inside of the

forearm faces back as well. A rule of thumb is that the amount of elbow bend
determines how good the catch is, and all good backstrokers have some degree
of elbow bend. In the ideal catch position, the arm forms the shape of a hook
above the head, and it can cradle and catch the water that is to the side of the
body. All this happens while the arm is still well above the head.
The swimmer must achieve two prerequisite positions to initiate a good catch:
1. For the elbow to bend and for the arm to twist in the manner described, the
arm has to be oriented so that the point of the elbow is facing outward or
laterally. The elbow will rotate upward, away from the head, when it bends.
2. To orient the way properly and to keep the hand underwater during the
entire catch, the body first needs to be rotated toward the side of hand entry
and the rotation needs to be completed before the catch is made.
Without hitting these positions, the arm will physically not be able to bend to
get to catch position. If a swimmer does not set up the catch well, the swimmer’s
arm stays straight and pushes water either downward or to the side. In either
case, water is pushed in a direction that isn’t optimal for producing propulsion.
Regardless of whether the arm moves downward or to the side, the reason is
the same—the rotation isn’t completed soon enough. The swimmer usually
compensates for this by pressing the arm down to help continue the body rota-
tion onto that side. Similarly, the arm can be pressed laterally to the side if body
rotation stops before reaching the recommended angle of 30 degrees relative to
the surface of the water. The swimmer should attain the proper depth for the
catch based on the arm entry and body rotation, not because the arm is push-
ing downward. Note that this way of thinking is in conflict with the instruction
that many swimmers receive about the catch—to drive the hand and arm deep
to assist with rotation. But using the timing and technique described here is the
best way to achieve the most propulsive stroke.
In the ideal backstroke technique, the palm should never be pitched downward
to face the bottom of the pool during the initial part of the stroke. The thumb
should always face straight up and the palm should initially face laterally before
it quickly transitions to facing backward toward the feet for the remainder of the
arm stroke. The fingertips need to face directly to the side (laterally) while the
palm faces rearward. Any compromise of those positions compromises the catch.
The optimal catch may be visible to an observer on deck, and anybody in
the water will definitely be able to see it. Besides the body rotation and arm
orientation, the proper depth and width of the hand and arm are important to
achieving a proper catch.
Depth of the Stroke
The hand should travel through the water in a straight line at a constant depth
for the most propulsive phase of the pull, from the start of the catch until the
hand reaches the waist. The hand should be just under the surface of the water, or

--- Page 68 Text ---
|
Backstroke Technique 57
as shallow as a swimmer can move his hand through the water without causing
disturbance on the surface. Stating an exact depth that a swimmer should aim
to achieve is difficult because many of the best backstrokers vary in this to some
degree, but a general depth of 4 to 12 inches (10 to 30 cm) under the surface is
recommended. Swimmers often cannot think in terms of exact numbers, so the
general term shallow should be sufficient. This depth and the straight-line pull
pattern will enable the strongest and most efficient pull.
As mentioned earlier, conflicting teachings have encouraged athletes to reach
as deeply as possible during the catch and then move the hand down and then
up in a wave-shaped pull pattern. The rationalization that this type of a pull pat-
tern will produce lift-based propulsion has already been discussed, but another
incorrect belief behind trying to have a deep pull is that deeper water is better
to pull. Some have said that deep water is still water. It is true that the hand
can be too shallow if it’s breaking the surface or creating waves at the surface,
but if the surface is not disturbed and all the motion is directed toward push-
ing water in the proper direction, the shallow pull will be more effective than a
deeper one. There is no compelling evidence that a deep pull will be any more
beneficial or efficient than a shallow pull. In fact, a deeper pull has a number
of major drawbacks that outweigh any potential insignificant benefit that we
could envision. A deeper pull will
• lead to a less effective catch and initiate an S-shaped hand path that will
direct water up and down, not backward toward the feet;
• increase the total time required to execute the stroke, reducing stroke rate
and speed at the same time; and
• induce a weaker pull because the arm will be too far behind the plane of
the body (more to come on this point later).
A pull that stays to the side of the body and keeps the hand just under the
surface is definitely what we see repeatedly in video of the best backstrokers.
The pull of many world-record holders and Olympic medalists is so shallow
that in underwater video taken from the side just underneath the surface, the
hands move through the water at a depth just underneath the laneline buoys in
the pool (in other words, the pull is very shallow). Pulling in this way means
that the swimmer wastes no time or movements to get deep and that the hand
is constantly pushing water backward because it is not wavering up or down.
A pull that takes place just beneath the surface of the water is not only the
most efficient but also the strongest because the swimmer’s arm will be to the
side of the body, allowing the body and arm to remain connected and work
together to produce power. The concept of the kinetic chain, in which forces and
power generated in one part of the body can flow to other parts of the body to
augment the forces generated locally, is not new to sport, but it is not commonly
discussed in swimming literature.
During the initial phase of the pull, the upper arm should be positioned in
the scapular plane to achieve the strongest and most effective pull (figure 3.2).

 Figure 3.2 Initial phase of the backstroke pull.
Imagine looking at a swimmer head on as she catches the water with the left arm.
If the upper arm is in the scapular plane, we should be able to draw a straight line
from the right shoulder to the left elbow. In this position the arm can remain
connected to the body (a relatively stable base of support) so that the swimmer
can engage the strongest muscles of the upper back when producing propulsion.
Although the natural range of motion for most people allows the upper arm
to be slightly behind the back, the swimmer can safely aim to have the upper
arm and the back form a straight line with each other. In many instances, erring
on the side of having the arm too far forward is better than having the arm too
far behind the scapular plane. When we see this alignment of the upper arm
and back, we call it being lined up or in line. Executing a shallow pull makes it
likely that the arm and back will line up and work together.
Imagine being asked to throw a ball as hard as possible toward the ground
while standing up. The best, most natural arm angle for that throw would be
to have it somewhere between directly in front of you and directly to the side
of the body. It would definitely not be a throw that you would try to make with
your arm reaching behind your body. Now make that throw while lying on your
back with your upper arm also in contact with the ground. You will find that to
generate the most force when throwing the ball, the arm will be to the side and
in line with the back. That’s how the backstroke arm pull should feel. Translate
that to lying in water by rotating the body downward so that the throwing arm is
completely submerged in the water. That’s what the backstroke pull should be like.
Mechanics and Injury Risk
Unfortunately, backstrokers often experience shoulder pain. Most swimmers
attribute shoulder pain to the repeated cyclic motion of the arm stroke, but
more specifically and accurately, it should be attributed to flaws in the repeated

--- Page 70 Text ---
|
Backstroke Technique 59
cyclic motion of the arm stroke. This diagnosis is actually a good thing because
it means that the problem can be remedied and relieved.
When the arm and back are not in line with each other, and the upper arm
is behind the line of the back, the position is called humeral hyperextension.
Repeated pulling motions in this position are not within the natural range of
movement for most people, and the shoulder impingement can become painful
over time. To diagnose the contributing factors to any pain, the swimmer must be
able to locate the specific point in the stroke where the shoulder is causing pain.
If the swimmer identifies the first half of the underwater arm stroke, specifically
the catch, as the part that hurts, then the pain is likely arising because the arm
is too far behind the back and outside the scapular plane.
A combination of two movements can fix the pathological mechanics, relieve
the pain, and possibly eliminate any stroke problems. The swimmer can either
bring the arm closer to the surface or increase the body rotation to that side.
Most of the time, the cause of the pain is that the swimmer drives the arm too
deep on the initial hand entry and catch; to remedy this problem, the swimmer
just needs to bring the hand and arm closer to the surface.
Midpull Mechanics
After the catch position is established, the palm and forearm need to maintain
pressure against the water and maximize propulsion. The initial hook-shape
catch position of the arm becomes less of a hook as the arm moves through
the water until the arm reaches shoulder level, at which point the arm should
be directly out to the side of the body (figure 3.3). At this point, with the upper
arm and the back lined up and the hand, elbow, and shoulder all at the same

level, the elbow angle should be about 110 to 120 degrees, or slightly more than
90 degrees. Because no swimmer can determine exact arm angle when moving
at full speed, this figure is just a guide to give a swimmer a goal to strive for. If
the elbow angle is much larger than 110 to 120 degrees, the arm likely will be
at a mechanical disadvantage because it is too straight (long moment arm from
the shoulder to the hand) and it will not be possible to engage the strongest
muscles in the body optimally. If the elbow angle is much smaller than 110 to
120 degrees, the arm might be too compact and too close to the body for it to
be able to engage in an effective pull.
A key aspect to an effective pull is for the hand and elbow to move through
the water together in the same plane. A common flaw is for the arm to collapse so
that the elbow is in front of the hand as the arm moves through the water. From
the moment when the swimmer initiates the catch, the goal should be to have
the hand and forearm pull through the water together. If the arm collapses, the
swimmer will not be able to maximize the size of the pulling surface and will
likely try to rush through the pull too quickly. This often happens if a swimmer
tries to swim with a higher stroke rate than her strength can handle while main-
taining proper technique. With the elbow pulling in front of the hand, moving
the arm through the water will definitely be easier and the arm tempo will be
faster, but the position is not mechanically efficient. The swimmer should slow
the motion to a speed that is appropriate for her strength to maintain the best
technique. When the swimmer demonstrates the ability to maintain the proper
mechanics, she can progress to faster tempos.
A similar indicator that the hand may not be holding on to water during
the pull occurs when the hand slides or slices through the water, that is, when
the palm is pitched downward and the thumb is leading the hand movement
through the water. The palm needs to face squarely toward the feet. If this is not
happening, the swimmer again might need to slow the arm speed to focus on
maintaining proper mechanics.
The lats, pecs, and even the core should be involved in the pull; the goal is to
pull with the entire body, not just the arm. The entire point of having the arm
connected to the body is that the arm is much stronger when its motion is sup-
ported by the body. Olympic champion Aaron Peirsol went as far as describing
this whole-body involvement as a side crunch. This side crunch is much more
than just a feeling to this swimmer and others; it's visible to the observer in many
of the top backstrokers. The upper body bends or crunches to the side during
the catch, as if the nearer hip is trying to connect to the hand. Stand up and
hold your right arm out to your side as if in the catch position. Now let the right
side of your core tense up and cave in a little as your right hip moves outward
a little. The tension of the entire right side is the body reinforcing the position
of the arm. A wiggle motion in backstroke is traditionally discouraged, but this
particular action, if subtle and controlled, reinforces the arm to make it stronger.
If we can agree that what’s been described is a good wiggle motion, the bad
wiggle that most swim coaches cringe at occurs when there is no tension in the

core, which is clearly the opposite of a side crunch. It usually occurs when a
young swimmer’s arm enters above his head and the whole body stretches out
and overextends on the side that the arm is entering. The legs of the swimmer
then fishtail from side to side as each arm enters the water.
Finish
During the finish (figure 3.4), the arm should still be pushing water backward
toward the feet while staying at a constant depth until the hand gets to about
the waist. At that point, the hand should start to pitch downward and inward
while pushing water in those directions. When the arm reaches full extension,
the hand should be slightly deeper than the hip and the palm should be facing
inward (pinky down, thumb up) and just wider than shoulder width.
This description of the finish contradicts the principle already discussed about
pushing water backward to move forward. But the finish serves a specific role in
the stroke—helping to drive body rotation and pivot the body to the other side to
set up the next catch—so it’s OK that water is not directed entirely toward the feet.
During each arm pull, the body (hips, torso, and shoulders) rotates toward
the side that is pulling. The downward motion to the finish then provides lever-
age that allows that side of the body to rotate in the other direction to initiate
the catch on the opposite arm. The swimmer needs to hold on to and maintain
pressure on the water through the finish so that the body has a base off which to
rotate. If not for the finish, the body would rely only on the kick and the opposite
arm entry to rotate to the other side, and that is not sufficient. Hitting a good
catch requires the body to be rotated completely before starting the catch, so
the contribution from the finish is necessary.
People have conflicting views on how the finish should be performed. The
most widely held view (and one that conflicts with the model described here)
is that the finish should sweep upward toward the surface and straight into the

recovery. The thought behind this movement is derived from thinking that the
swimmer can kill two birds with one stone, continuing to push water toward
the feet while progressing right from the finish into the exit from the water or
recovery. This technique is flawed in two ways. First, if the finish sweeps upward,
that upward push opposes the rotation needed to set up the opposite arm catch.
Second, sweeping upward into the recovery implies that the hand has room to
move upward in the water. If the catch and pull are done at the proper depth,
not much room will be available for the hand to move upward during the finish.
Some successful world-class backstrokers have finished in this way, but in observ-
ing the entry, catch, and rotation of their strokes, the rotation over to the other
side isn’t smooth. Instead, the rotation appears to be forced by the arm entry
and kick. Also, the catch isn’t the sharpest.
Rotation
Body rotation in backstroke enables the body to make each arm stroke as strong
and efficient as possible. An optimal body roll allows the arm to flex appropri-
ately, hit the catch, and connect to the body. If the body stayed completely flat,
the arms would pull through the water extended and straight out to the side or
the arm would reach behind the scapular plane. The pull would be inefficient
and weak in either case.
Another important outcome of good backstroke rotation is setting up the
recovery. A good rotation raises the shoulder of the recovering arm to the surface
of the water and allows the recovering arm to move freely.
In backstroke, the whole body, from the shoulders to the hips and the legs,
should rotate together as a unit. The difficult element of backstroke rotation is
that the body has to jump quickly from being rotated toward one side of the body
to being rotated toward the other side to support the alternating arm strokes.
Additionally, to optimize propulsion, each rotation needs to be completed before
the catch starts. Therefore, the timing and quickness of the rotation are critically
important. Luckily, rotating a large amount to each side is not necessary, so if the
timing and mechanics are correct, achieving the proper body roll is manageable.
Although many swimming coaches have taught that backstrokers should
rotate all the way on to the side, or alternatively that more rotation is always
better, that way of executing the stroke is incorrect and counterproductive. The
fastest backstroke technique takes place much more on the back than it does
on the side. Using video analysis tools to measure angles of USA Olympic and
national team swimmers from a head-on underwater camera view, we can say
with confidence that a rotation of 30 degrees to each side is average and adequate
for the world’s best. For reference, the 30-degree measurement represents the
separation between the horizontal surface of the water and the plane of the
shoulders of the swimmer. The range of rotation seen among elite backstrokers
can be as little as 20 degrees to each side and as much as 40 degrees, which is
still less than halfway on to the swimmer’s back.

Backstroke Technique 63
The main benefits of rotation are that it allows the arm to be fully submerged
and it sets the body up to execute the best pull possible. When those criteria are
fulfilled, no more rotation is necessary. One myth in swimming is that drag (not
propulsive drag, but the resistance experienced by the body as it moves through
the water) will be reduced by rotating all the way on to the side. This idea is
incorrect because the same amount of the body will be submerged underwa-
ter regardless of whether the body is rotated 30 degrees or 90 degrees. That is
because the buoyancy of the body won’t change based on the amount of body
rotation. By rotating all the way on to the side, more of the body isn’t floating
above the surface and the frontal surface area that cuts through the oncoming
water remains the same, so drag remains the same. With that being the case, a
30-degree rotation is sufficient. It allows a 110- to 120-degree elbow bend, the
hand to be 4 to 12 inches (10 to 30 cm) under the surface, and the upper arm to
be lined up with the back.
Regarding the timing and quickness of the rotation, the general rule is that
the body should rotate quickly and at a specific time in the stroke cycle—as one
arm is entering and the other arm is finishing. The rotation should happen only
at the beginning and end of the arm strokes, not during the most propulsive
parts of the arm stroke that occur between those times. If the rotation were to
occur in the middle of the stroke, the swimmer’s arm would be pushing through
the water as the body would be rotating away from it. The entire pull would be
weaker because the body wouldn’t remain engaged with the arm throughout
the pull. The arm would be positioned increasingly behind the body as the arm
stroke progressed. (Note that these rotation suggestions are opposite of what is
appropriate in freestyle, in which the swimmer does want to rotate during the
catch and propulsive phase because the body will rotate toward the arm, essen-
tially reinforcing and strengthening it.)
To hit the timing of the rotation correctly so that it is completed before the
catch and pull are initiated, the swimmer needs to make both sides of the arm
stroke—the entry of one arm and the finish of the other—work together through
the core. The entire body should be turning from one side to the other while the
arms provide the leverage to make that happen. As the underwater arm presses
downward at the finish, the hip on that side of the body should rotate upward. As
the recovering arm comes down toward the water, that side of the body should
rotate downward. The body should be halfway through the rotation (flat, or at
zero degrees rotation) when the hand of the recovering arm is entering the water
and the underwater finish is nearly complete. The second half of the rotation (the
downward rotation) should happen seamlessly as the entering hand is submerged
just below the surface and is starting to move outward into the catch. At the
same time, the other hand and arm will be completing the finish and preparing
to exit the water.
A common question is, “Where does the body rotation originate—from the
hips, the shoulders, the legs, or somewhere else?” Because the rotation is being
driven by one arm entry and one arm finish, the correct answer is that the rotation

--- Page 75 Text ---
}
64 Mark
comes from both the hips and shoulders. When thought of and performed in
that way, the rotation will be done effectively and properly.
When it comes to errors around execution of the rotation, the part that most
swimmers miss is not using the finish to drive the hips into the rotation. Late
rotation is the result, which creates problems in engaging the catch with the
opposite arm. In some extreme cases of late rotation, the body may not even start
to rotate until the hand of the recovering arm enters the water. When swimmers
use the finish of the pull as leverage for the rotation, the rotation will be on time
and the catch and pull will have the best opportunity to be ideal.
Another common and noticeable mistake in backstroke occurs on the hand
entry. The hand should enter the water pinky first and the palm should be facing
away from the body and in line with the shoulders or just outside shoulder width
so that it can move right into the catch after entry. The flaw that many swimmers
have is that their hands enter too narrowly, inside the line of the shoulders and
possibly even crossing over the centerline of the body behind the head. The hand
may also enter with the back of the hand first instead of pinky first. This mistake
is often misdiagnosed. When this crossover occurs, it becomes one of the most
frustrating things to correct because most swimmers take an incorrect approach
when trying to fix the stroke flaw. Most swimmers attempt to correct the entry by
simply moving the arm wider, but regardless of how hard the swimmer works on it,
the hand positioning at entry often never improves at all. In most cases, the narrow
and back-of-the-hand entry is caused by a late rotation; when the rotation is late,
the entry occurs while the body is still rotated to the wrong side. The natural point
of entry for the hand is therefore too narrow because of the way that the body is
angled at the time. Late rotation timing will cause the arm to swing slightly across
the water instead of straight down into it. Proper rotation timing—with the body
rotated flat at the time of the hand entry—will lead to the proper hand entry location.
Arm Recovery
The above-water arm recovery is the connection between the propulsive phases
of the arm strokes—the finish of one arm stroke and the entry and catch of the
next. The recovery itself may not directly affect propulsion, but it plays an impor-
tant role in the overall execution of the stroke. The overall nature of the recovery
motion can be best described as a controlled throw of the entire arm. The arm
motion should be relaxed but not floppy, controlled but not tense, quick but not
forced, almost like throwing a ball or swinging a golf club. After the initiation
of the recovery, the momentum of the arm swinging up and around the water
will help carry it through the entire above-water motion.
The recovery starts after the downward finish of the underwater arm stroke.
The hand should be lifted to the surface with the thumb side up. From the end
of the finish until the arm breaks the surface of the water is the only underwater
phase of the stroke that is nonpropulsive, but the critical role of the downward
finish in the rotation timing necessitates having this dead space.

--- Page 76 Text ---
|
Backstroke Technique 65
The entire arm recovery takes place at shoulder width. Initially, the arm should
rise vertically while still next to the hip, and then throughout the motion the
arm stays in line with the shoulder and next to the body. Because the body is
never rotated a significant amount during the recovery, the shoulders and arms
remain to the side of the body. The body does not need to be rotated more than
the recommended 30 degrees to lift the shoulder farther, because continued
rotation will affect the underwater pull on the opposite side. From the swim-
mer’s viewpoint, the arms will always remain to the side of the face and on the
edge of the field of vision. If the shoulder touches or comes close to the chin,
or if the hand or arm is in front of the face where the swimmer can easily see it,
the arm recovery is too narrow or the rotation is excessive.
For more than half of the recovery, the hand should be oriented with the
thumb leading the motion and the palm facing inward (medially), but the
hand will enter the water with the pinky finger first and the palm facing
outward to set up the best underwater catch. The rotation of the hand from a
thumb-first to a pinky-first position happens after the hand is at the highest
point of the recovery, as the hand and arm are on the downward approach to
entering the water and in conjunction with the body’s rotation to that side.
The hand rotation is often taught as an independent movement at the top
of the recovery, but it is functionally and technically better to execute this
motion as the arm is on the downward approach to the entry and while the
body is pivoting to that side.
The completion of the arm recovery and initiation of the catch happen
in quick succession, as the hand and arm continue the path that has been
set in motion and drive down into the water pinky first. In this phase the
arm and the body move together toward the water to put the hand and arm
in the perfect position together to start the next catch. This combination of
simultaneous movements—the downward finish, hand rotation, body pivot,
and arm entry—is critical as a swimmer prepares for the next catch, and this
aspect of technique is one of the things that sets the elite backstrokers apart
from everyone else.
Often coaches comment that the hand should enter the water in such a way
to avoid forming air bubbles. Unfortunately, no matter how the hand enters
the water, air bubbles are created and those bubbles can stay attached to the
arm and trail off it throughout the catch and midpull of the underwater arm
stroke. Many people believe that these air bubbles are detrimental, but further
investigation is necessary to determine whether the bubbles have any effect on
propulsion. The creation of bubbles is nearly inevitable as the wide, rounded
edge of the human hand and arm crash straight down into the water. The fact
that the arm stroke starts immediately without any time for the air bubbles to
dissipate off the arm naturally also explains why the bubbles will undoubtedly
trail off the arm as it moves through the water. This phenomenon exists with
even the world’s best backstrokers, which would lead us to believe that the
existence of air bubbles in the stroke is inconsequential.

Kicking
Debate has often occurred about the contribution of kicking in freestyle and
backstroke to propulsion. Some even suggest that kicking should be deempha-
sized because it takes up valuable energy and oxygen with disproportional gains
in speed. This thinking has been contradicted by the practical evidence of the
best swimmers in the United States as well as the world. Among USA national
team members, an overwhelming majority are fast kickers who use a six-beat
kick (i.e., six kicks per arm cycle). Kicking in backstroke serves three purposes:
1. It provides propulsion to the stroke. Certainly, when separated from the
arms, kicking is much less propulsive than pulling. But kicking lightens
the load on the arms and allows the arms not to pull as much or as hard to
travel the same distance. Swimmers with good kicks theoretically can take
fewer strokes and conserve arm strength.
2. It aids body rotation. A good kick supports good technique because it pro-
vides a stable foundation off which the body can rotate. The hips and legs
rotate along with the body, and the kick helps make that happen.
3. It supports proper head and body position. A good kick allows the legs and
hips to remain high in the water. Otherwise, the legs will drag and sink,
bringing the hips down too.
All the best backstrokers are strong kickers, and the technique itself is generally
the same for all of them.
The most propulsive part of the kick is the upkick (the kick toward the surface
of the water), and the finish of the upkick is the most propulsive phase of the kick.
The motion is composed of two parts: driving the knee toward the surface and
snapping the lower leg upward toward the surface. The first part is driven by the
hip flexors, whereas the second part is like a leg extension exercise and is driven
by the quadriceps. At the completion of the leg extension, the motion should
follow through the feet and toes. The upkick should finish just at the surface.
Many look for churning water at the surface as a sign of a good kick, and this
will happen if the legs whip through a great upkick and the toes are at or just
peek through the plane of the surface. Aiming for the feet to break the surface of
the water is not recommended because this action does not increase propulsion;
kicking air doesn’t help a swimmer move forward. Breaking the surface of the
water also throws off the body’s balance in the water because one leg would be
free in the air while the other is pushing on water under the surface.
Of course, every upkick is accompanied by a downkick. Some propulsion
certainly results from the downkick, but because of human anatomy, the upkick
(legs moving forward) is always going to be more powerful and propulsive than
the downkick (legs moving backward). This doesn't mean that the downkick
should be emphasized any less. The primary role of the downkick, however,
should be to set up the upkick, so a quick, fast movement for the downkick

--- Page 78 Text ---
|
Backstroke Technique 67
just means that the upkick will be ready to fire faster and sooner. The downkick
occurs by driving the leg and the heel down toward the bottom of the pool. The
legs should be held straight, but without locking the knees, during this motion.
The exact depth of the downkick will vary by individual (a swimmer with longer
legs will finish lower than a swimmer with shorter legs), but it can definitely
be said that the downkick will end (and the upkick will start) deeper than the
hips. A swimmer should not be worried about kicking too deeply. As long as
the swimmer is able to kick six times per arm cycle, the kick is of proper size.
A six-beat kick is the most natural and common style of kicking used in back-
stroke. A few elite backstrokers have been observed using a four-beat kick, and at
least one swimmer kicks with an eight-beat kick (Olympic champion and world-
record holder Natalie Coughlin, no less). A four- or eight-beat kick is unnatural,
however, and is likely a sign that the upper body and lower body are disconnected
and not working together. A four- or eight-beat kick means that an even number
of kicks are occurring per arm stroke and that the right and left sides of the body
will be asymmetrical. In other words, if the right arm enters when the left leg is
extended in the upkick, the left arm also enters when the left leg is extended in
the upkick (the opposite pattern seen with the right arm). Consideration should
be given to changing a four- or eight-beat kicker into a six-beat kicker. Four beats
means that there is opportunity for two more kicks per cycle. Eight beats could
mean that the legs are just moving extremely fast, but it could also mean that the
arms are moving too slowly in order to accommodate the extra kicks.
A few successful backstrokers cross their legs sideways on top of each other.
In 2012 two elite backstrokers in the United States, national team members and
Olympic Trials finalists David Plummer and Bonnie Brandon, kicked in this way.
Imagining how this kick could be beneficial is difficult, but these swimmers are
among the best in the country. Plummer made a concerted effort to change the
kick to a more traditional, no-crossover technique. In attempting to make this
change, Plummer and his coach found that the athlete’s overall speed was affected
because he could not maintain the same arm tempo as he had previously, and he
would get tired more quickly. After college, Plummer abandoned the traditional
kick, went on to achieve personal best times, and become a national champion
in the 100-meter backstroke.
The national champion with the scissor kick and the Olympic champion
with eight beats per cycle just go to show that occasionally someone can suc-
ceed without textbook technique. Consideration needs to be made for how a
change affects other aspects of the stroke, whether it is arm tempo, physiologi-
cal endurance, or something else, especially if the affected areas are strengths
of the particular athlete.
Body and Head Position
The third purpose of a backstroke kick is to support good head and body posi-
tion. The legs, hips, and upper body should all ride through the water as close

--- Page 79 Text ---

to the surface as possible and at the same level. The reason for the legs and hips
to be in the same line is to reduce resistance. If the upper body, hips, and legs
are not horizontal, then more surface area of the body than necessary is push-
ing against the water and resisting the direction in which the swimmer wants
to travel. A swimmer who is bouncing up and down in the water typically has a
mechanical flaw in the stroke that pushes the swimmer upward. (The swimmer
will then fall, or bounce down, in the water because the action that is pushing
the swimmer upward cannot be maintained.)
The head should sit a little higher in the water than the rest of the body and
poke through the surface in a slightly tilted position. In the proper position, the
face and forehead will be above the surface and the line of the water will be at ear
level. The head tilt is subtle, as if the head were resting on a thin pillow in bed.
The head tilt will not be anywhere close to having the chin tucked and touching
the chest, nor will the head be neutral so that the eyes are looking straight up
at the ceiling. Thus, the neck will be slightly curved forward and the shoulders
will be relaxed forward, instead of both the neck and shoulders being stiff and
upright as if the person is standing at attention. This natural position of the neck
and shoulders allows the shoulders to move freely to swing around and pull,
and it allows the upper body to rotate and support the arms.
The hips will be in an ideal position to kick and simultaneously reduce form
drag if they are at the surface of the water. But to maintain optimal position, a
swimmer must avoid doing two things—arching the back and pushing the head
back into the water. Arching the back may help bring the hips closer to the sur-
face, but in doing so, it puts the legs and upper body into terribly compromised
positions. With an arched back, the legs will drop lower and the shoulders will
likely be pulled back too. The hips will also be tilted in such a way that the legs
cannot kick freely and effectively. If the back is to be curved in any direction,
being curved into flexion is much better than being arched into hyperextension.
Flexing the torso slightly may lead the swimmer to sit up more than necessary
and be difficult to maintain over the course of a race, but at least the arms and
legs will be able to contribute maximally and not create more drag than necessary.
Summary
Coaches need to focus on a number of key elements when teaching swimmers
to achieve world-class backstroke technique.
Swimmers should focus on the timing and magnitude of the body rotation.
The body roll should occur within a short window as one arm finishes its pull and
the other enters the water. Swimmers need to achieve between 20 and 40 degrees
of rotation to each side to set up the catch and achieve proper pulling depth.
The catch sets up the entire stroke. In the catch, athletes should focus on setting
the hand and arm in the proper position for the remainder of the pull. Position
the upper arm in the scapular plane to link it to the body and orient the palm of
the hand and the forearm to push water toward the feet throughout the stroke.

--- Page 80 Text ---
|
Backstroke Technique 69
The stroke should occur between 4 and 12 inches (10 and 30 cm) below the
surface of the water. Achieving a deep catch and pull is unnecessary. In fact,
doing so may be counterproductive to generating propulsion.
The swimmer should push the water straight back toward the feet to generate
the most propulsion. Resistive drag produces more force than the lift forces com-
monly generated through sweeping S motions. Directing as much force toward
the feet as possible will propel the swimmer through the water.
The swimmer should maintain a flat body posture in the water with the head
tilted ever so slightly forward. Lifting the head too much or arching the back
increases the resistive drag experienced by the body and places the arms and
legs in positions from which they cannot produce propulsion optimally.
Swimmers should strive for a six-beat kick. The kick is important for generat-
ing propulsion and maintaining body position, but more important, it sets up
and drives the body rotation that is necessary for a successful stroke.
Do not be afraid to play around with things. Watch video, experiment by
making small changes to mechanics, and above all ask questions. That is the
way we all get better.

CHAPTER
Breaststroke Technique
—Russell Mark
There is a visual perception that breaststroke technique varies greatly among
swimmers, even among elite breaststrokers. Therefore, a variety of explana-
tions and teachings of the stroke exist. Many approach breaststroke technique
in a timid, vague way.
But close examination and analysis of underwater video show that elite
breaststrokers have a lot in common in the fundamentals of their swimming
technique. Hundreds of hours of unbiased film study of the world’s best breast-
strokers performing in races and workouts have led to the observations detailed
in this chapter. Every aspect is broken down in detail to explain the purpose
and mechanics of each component. All swimmers and coaches should strive to
gravitate toward these foundational traits, regardless of the above-water appear-
ance or a swimmer’s feel of the stroke.
Breaststroke Is Won in the Spaces
Bill Boomer, a renowned swimming technique expert known for his unique
perspective and explanation, said that breaststroke is “won in the spaces” (per-
sonal correspondence). The significance of this phrase is profound, when it is
understood and made a focus of the stroke. The “space” in breaststroke, according
to Boomer, is the portion of the stroke capturing the extension of the arms and
the ensuing forward glide, as in the space (or time) between the propulsive parts
of the arm stroke. How the breaststroke is won in these spaces is best explained
anecdotally. In a 200 or 400 individual medley race, breaststroke specialists are
typically included in the field of swimmers. During the breaststroke leg of the
race, dramatic lead changes can occur. When the better breaststrokers make their
71

moves and surge ahead, we can see that the performance advantage is gained
in these spaces, not during the part of the stroke in which the arms are pulling
back and supposedly creating forward propulsion. Everyone would agree about
this observation, yet it’s still counterintuitive and important to recognize.
If the breaststroke is won in the spaces, what allows a swimmer to maximize
speed in the spaces and what role does the arm pull play if the more significant
part of the stroke seems to occur when the arms are recovering forward or are
extended in front of the body? Several theories have been put forward to explain
how performance gains are made. The predominant thought about breaststroke
is that a great kick is the key to being a great breaststroker and maximizing
speed in the spaces. But the kick is only part of the equation. Fast breaststroke,
maximizing performance in the spaces, is all about a using the body and core
to surge forward. The kick, pull, and good timing are all important components
of a fast breaststroke, but they are all driven by the body and core.
Another observation can be made when comparing good and mediocre
breaststrokers. Good breaststrokers do a better job of maintaining forward speed
throughout the stroke. Average breaststrokers tend to adopt a stop-and-go style
of stroke, stopping when the upper body is at the highest point at the peak of the
breath and going when the arms are extending forward and the legs are kicking.
It should be obvious why a swimmer would never want to approach a stopping
point in the stroke, and the best breaststrokers minimize velocity fluctuations
in the stroke cycle so that they are always moving forward. In addition, by
eliminating and minimizing any dead spots in the stroke, a breaststroker will
be entering the space of the stroke with more speed, which will lead to even
more effective use of the space.
Body Line in Breaststroke
Every breaststroke cycle should start and finish from a highly streamlined body
position, also called the body line. Even if just for a fraction of a second, a good
breaststroker will achieve a good body line to maximize the speed created from
the pull, kick, and body drive.
Good Body Line
An exceptional body line is similar to a tight streamlined position. This posi-
tion is the fastest for traveling through the water when the arms and legs are not
propelling the body forward. The position of the hands, head, hips, and feet are
great indicators of a good breaststroke body line. From the fingertips to the toes,
the body forms a straight horizontal line just under the surface of the water with
all points aligned. The arms are outstretched above the head.
A good breaststroke body line is different from the streamlining that a swim-
mer achieves off a start or turn in two ways: The hands should not overlap, nor
should the arms be squeezed together against the ears. A good breaststroke
body line is achieved when the head is between the arms and the arms just

Breaststroke Technique 73
lightly touch the sides of the head, if at all. The arms should be straight, but not
forcefully extended, and the hands should be inside shoulder width. The hands
should be flat, the palms should be down, and the hands should have some
space between them.
Body Line Errors and Corrections
Breaks in the body line most often occur with the head position. Typically, poor
positioning occurs because the head is held too high. The head needs to hide
between the arms as much as possible. The eyes don’t necessarily need to look
straight down, and in fact many of the best breaststrokers tilt their heads slightly
forward so that their eyes are looking down and slightly forward. A high head
position creates additional drag and slows the swimmer by causing the hips,
legs, and feet to drop in the water. This position presents more of the body to
the oncoming water flow, resulting in a considerable increase in drag. If the hips
and legs appear to be too low and dragging through the water, a coach should
take notice of the head position first and see whether the overall body position
can be corrected simply by adjusting the head position. Getting the head in line
will likely raise the feet, hips, and legs.
Also, a swimmer may be forcing the head too far below the body line. This
position is also not beneficial to performance. Dropping the head also creates
excess drag, and it requires the swimmer to lift the head more than normal to
take a breath. A swimmer’s head may go below the streamline because of over-
compensating for throwing the head down after the breath. The intention behind
throwing the head down is a good one, but the effort typically is misdirected,
resulting in increased drag. The swimmer should use this lunge to drive the body
and head forward, not downward, helping to maintain the streamlined body line.
Another common contributor to a poor body line is driving the hands and
arms downward and deeper into the water when extending forward during the
arm recovery. Downward motion increases the overall drag experienced by the
swimmer, but the consequences of these actions do not stop there. Arising from
the deep position of the hands, the swimmer has to bring the hands, arms, head,
and body back up to the surface of the water to get into the next stroke cycle.
This effort is wasted, and the body position that results from the upper half of
the body climbing back to the surface forces the lower half of the body—the hips
and legs—to drop down in the water. This position is not only a poor body line
but also can be deemed illegal for performing a dolphin kick.
Arm Pull
After the fundamentals of a good body line are established, the focus of the
stroke should be on generating propulsion. The propulsive movements of each
stroke start with the arm pull. The arm pull in breaststroke is different from
that of the other three strokes in that it doesn’t drive the overall propulsion
of the stroke; the legs and the kick contribute as much as the arms do to the

--- Page 85 Text ---

74 Mark
overall propulsion generated in the stroke. The general shape of the pull pattern
is an oval shape that is wider to the sides and flatter and more squished in the
front-to-back direction. The path of the hands never makes any sharp angles or
changes of direction.
The primary role of the pull is to set up the rest of the stroke, including the
all-important spaces. The focus of the pull should not be to pull water toward
the feet, as in the other competitive strokes. In fact, at no point in the stroke
cycle do the palms or arms push water directly backward.
Video Analysis
Abundant video evidence suggests that overall speed in breaststroke is not dic-
tated by the arm pull. In dissecting video of four swimmers (two male and two
female) who have been world champions, Olympic champions, world-record
holders, or American record holders in both the 100-meter and 200-meter
breaststroke, we can identify the technique differences that occur when swim-
mers change speeds from 200 pace to 100 pace.
What the video analysis showed was interesting. The speed and tempo of the
100-meter races, as expected, was faster than the speed and tempo of the 200-
meter races. The glide time between each stroke cycle in the 100-meter races
was much shorter. Also, in the 100-meter races, the feet came up and recovered
toward the buttocks faster to set up the kick.
But the hand speed—the time it took from start to finish of the arm pull—
remained the same despite the different speeds and tempos of the races. This
same phenomenon was seen in all four swimmers, and the finding indicates that
breaststroke speed may not be determined by arm speed. Instead, swimming
speed is likely affected more by the glide time and the speed of the leg recovery
as the breaststroke swimmer sets up the kick. The bottom line is that to swim
faster, the best breaststrokers do not pull more water with the hands and arms
nor do they pull faster.
Sculling Out
The first movement of the arm stroke is for the hands to scull outward (figure
4.1). With the arms remaining straight, the palms face outward and separate
from each other, pressing directly out to the sides. The final width of this scull-
ing motion varies by swimmer, but it should fall outside the athlete’s shoulder
width, generally with the arms at 11 o’clock and 1 o’clock position if the arms
were the hands of an analog clock. Generally, male swimmers tend to scull
wider than female swimmers do because men have greater strength at the wider
positions than women do. The head should remain in line with the rest of the
body during this beginning phase of the pull.
Of all possible movements that a swimmer can do to start the pull, this scull-
ing action is definitely not the fastest. But it’s no coincidence that all the fastest
breaststrokers in the world perform a similar sculling action. Many state that

it’s a focus of their stroke. As seen in underwater video taken from a side view,
the palms are clearly oriented to face toward the sides of the pool.
Isolated, the outward scull is not highly propulsive or effective, but its effect
on the rest of the stroke is beneficial. The scull keeps the head and the rest of
the body in line for a while longer. Most important, it sets up the round shape
of the arm pull, which is crucial when the arm pull transitions from moving
backward to recovering forward. So although the outward scull is not the fastest
initial option of the pull, it is extremely important to proper execution of the
remainder of the stroke.
The best thing that a breaststroker can do is to be patient with the initiation
of the arm pull and the execution of the breath. A swimmer must trust that wait-
ing to get propulsion out of the arms and taking a late breath are both critical
to maintaining overall speed.
If a swimmer goes for immediate gratification and tries to get propulsion
too early in the stroke by pointing the fingertips down toward the bottom of
the pool, keeping the elbows high, and pushing water straight back with the
palms and forearms, the propulsion generated by the arms in the first part of the
stroke will be greater. But this approach to technique, while commonly taught,
is much less efficient when looking at the big picture. It will cause the upper

body to rise earlier so that the swimmer can take a breath, sinking the hips and
legs lower, and force the swimmer to exert more energy because of the greater
emphasis on the arms. The pull pattern will be more straight back, rather than
the recommended round shape, making the transition to the recovery (and the
space) more abrupt and less smooth and effective.
These negative effects make a pull in which propulsion comes from the arms
a less attractive option. With that said, a swimmer may experience some success
using this type of stroke in a short-course yards race because less actual swim-
ming is done per length and the swimmer may be able to maintain this type of
pull without fatiguing and slowing down. But when competing in a 25-meter
or 50-meter pool, the concept of pulling straight back will not provide the best
result for many athletes.
Deeper Hands
After the outward scull with straight arms, the hands continue to move wider
but also start to gain some depth in the water. The fingertips pitch downward,
and the forearms rotate downward as well. The elbows stay at the same level and
should not drop much deeper in the water. The arms are angled so that they start
to push water downward and backward. During this phase of the arm pull, the
head starts to rise toward the surface and the upper body starts angling upward
in preparation for the breath.
After the outward scull has been completed, the arm pull can be best described
as scooping or gathering water and bringing all that water toward the hips. The
motion of the arms in this phase of the stroke is actually three-dimensional;
components of the pull occur front to back, side to side, and up and down. The
hands and arms simultaneously move backward (toward the feet) and wider and
then come closer and deeper before they return to the surface.
The widest point of the pull occurs when the arms are still in front of the
shoulders. From that point, the hand path rounds out and starts moving in
toward the body. The hands are pitched inward as well and press deeper at a
much greater rate while also moving backward. That motion drives the shoulders
and head to come out of the water.
As a rule, when the hands are moving laterally, the palms should be pitched
outward or inward in the same direction that the hands are moving. The hands
should never slice through the water pinky first or thumb first; rather, the palms
should change their angle of attack so that they are pushing directly against the
water in the direction that the hands are moving.
Taking Breath
During the inward sweep, not any earlier in the stroke, the face breaks the surface
of the water. Because the upper body is rising, the elbows must remain at the
same depth in the water even though the hands press deeper. Underwater video
of world-class breaststrokers shows surprising depth of the hands during this

--- Page 88 Text ---
|
Breaststroke Technique 77
phase of the stroke; in fact, some swimmers’ hands are deeper than the entire
rest of their bodies. Allowing some depth to the hands is necessary to support
the height of the upper body during the breath. The key is that the depth of the
hands occurs while the hands are moving inward and backward; they should
never be oriented in such a way that they are pressing directly toward the bottom
of the pool.
When the upper body is rising above the water during the arm stroke, note that
the lifting of the torso occurs because of the movement of the arms, not because
the swimmer is actively forcing the head up or arching the back. Additionally,
the swimmer should not be thinking about lifting the upper body through the
back of the neck. These movements can force the swimmer too high and cause
excessive up-and-down motions that produce drag and drain energy within the
stroke.
Although the body is rising, the swimmer should focus on staying forward
and directing the motion of the body forward. The upper body remains at a
forward angle over the surface of the water, rising up and forward through the
line of the shoulders. The shoulders point diagonally forward and should never
be pulled back.
Many swimmers and coaches refer to a feeling of pulling the hips forward.
For many swimmers and coaches, that teaching cue helps to focus efforts on
keeping the body moving forward as the torso rises up for the breath. The general
concept behind pulling the hips forward draws from the inward motion of the
arm stroke, during which the swimmer emphasizes anchoring the arms in the
water so that the hips and body move forward toward the hands. During the
inward motion, the body also rises, and by focusing on moving the hips and
body forward, the upper body stays forward as well. The opposite occurs if the
upper body lifts up too much; the hips and legs will angle or move downward.
Positioning the Head
The swimmer’s head position also relates directly to the body position and the
body line achieved during the stroke. When the head breaks the surface, and
through most of the time when the head is returning under the surface, the eyes
should look mostly forward with maybe a hint of looking downward. The chin
and the chest need to be clearly separated, and the swimmer’s chin should not
be tucked.
As the head comes back down and approaches the surface of the water, the
eyes can look more downward. When the head is back in line between the arms,
the eyes look almost completely downward toward the bottom of the pool.
Further investigation is necessary to gain complete understanding of the merit
of having the eyes looking forward during the arm pull, but one USA Olympic
coach who is a staunch proponent of the head-up and eyes-forward technique
theorizes that the head position helps the swimmer engage the upper-body
muscles in the pull more effectively.

Transitioning to Recovery
About midway through the inward motion, when the hands pitch down to the
point that they are almost underneath the elbows, the critical aspect of transition-
ing the arms from pulling water to recovering the arms forward takes place. At
this point, the arm bend at the elbows increases as the hands change directions
to move forward and upward toward the surface.
One key to a good transition is that the hands should not pull back beyond the
vertical plane of the shoulders. Keeping the hands in front of the body ensures
that the transition to the forward recovery is smooth and efficient. Pulling any
farther back might give the swimmer a little more propulsion from the arms,
but doing so slows the transition, makes the space less effective, and can cause
the upper body to lift too high. All of these factors contribute directly to the
dreaded stop-and-go type of breaststroke discussed previously.
Although the hands should not pull back past the line of the shoulders, the
elbows can go farther back than that. The elbows of most successful breaststrokers
end up right next to the sides of the body, nearly touching their sides. At that
point, the hands have risen to the point at which the forearms are horizontal
in the water and the fingertips are pointing forward.
Being able to press the body forward and maintain forward speed throughout
the arm stroke is a critical aspect to fast breaststroke, and a balance must be
found between getting the most out of the pull while still being able to achieve
the necessary forward body surge. A swimmer might even find that he can surge
the body forward more effectively if the arms stay wider and more in front of the
body. The relationship is interesting: Having the biggest or strongest pull is often
not necessary to swim faster. This idea goes against the natural tendency of most
swimmers, who learn in other strokes to grab as much water as possible and pull
or push it backward toward the feet. The best breaststroke pull is full of subtle
nuances and violations to established rules for the other strokes: Don’t pull as
far back as possible, scull outward initially instead of pulling straight back, and
move the arms laterally more than they move toward the feet. Although different
from what a swimmer would do in the butterfly, backstroke, or freestyle, these
criteria set up the body to press forward faster.
Forward Lunge and Recovery
The surging and lunging forward of the body and core are the most important
parts of the stroke. The ability to do this effectively sets the best swimmers apart
from the rest. Basically, from the point at which the upper body is at its highest
and the head is at its peak height out of the water, the head and upper body press
forward dynamically to get the swimmer back into a great body line. Swimmers
should experiment to find the best starting point for the body surge. The position
will likely be a point at which the upper body is leaning forward over the surface
of the water, as opposed to being more vertical. A vertical position may give the
swimmer more time to press forward, but the swimmer likely would be starting

--- Page 90 Text ---
|
Breaststroke Technique 79
the press when the body is at a slower velocity because the drag created in achiev-
ing the vertical position will have slowed the body considerably. By keeping the
highest point of the breath more forward above the water, a swimmer will be able
to press the body forward effectively while maintaining forward speed.
During the actual body press, the head should stay connected to the body,
meaning that the head maintains a neutral position with respect to the spine
and is not thrown down into the water. The forward movement is driven by the
head but is powered by the core, like a forward crunch. On the last stroke of a
breaststroke race, many swimmers lunge forward with the body and arms, and a
similar type of feel and action should occur with every stroke. The breaststroke
is a whole-body engagement. The body surges forward in coordination with the
arm recovery to provide the most effective stroke.
Starting with the elbows beside the body and the fingertips pointing forward, the
swimmer pushes the elbows and hands forward to get the most dynamic recovery.
The elbows stay wide; the athlete should never try to squeeze the elbows together
during the recovery because narrow elbows will just slow the body and get in the
way of pressing the body forward. Instead, the swimmer should allow the elbows
to follow the hands, which will come together in the middle of the arm recovery
as the hands are moving forward.
Just as the elbows should not squeeze together, the hands should not clap
together. For many swimmers, a key focus point is to clap the palms together
right in front of the chest. Instead, the hands should just barely converge after the
recovery motion has already started.
At the start of the recovery, the palms most likely will be facing upward and
inward, a result of the hands moving upward and inward during the last part of
the inward sweep. The palms should be oriented to face the direction of the pull.
As the arms extend and reach forward, the forearms should pronate so that the
palms rotate downward. With the palms down, the muscles of the arm are in a
better position to extend effectively. When the arms are fully extended, the palms
should be facing the bottom of the pool and the thumbs should be adjacent to each
other. During the recovery, the hands should be slightly higher than the elbows,
grazing just over the top of the surface of the water. The hands will continue to rise
when the recovery starts to achieve this position. The elbows will rise a little too,
but they should remain under the surface of the water, which is actually mandatory
to remain within the technical rules of the stroke and not cause disqualification.
Just as the arms are about to hit full extension, the hands come back underneath
the surface in line with the elbows. When the recovery is completed, the head and
upper body will be just getting back into line with the arms. The head, shoulders,
elbows, and hands will be in line with each other under the surface of the water.
Breaststroke Kick
A single kick occurs during each stroke cycle. The timing of the pull and kick
and their occurrence in relation to each other is an important determinant of
breaststroke proficiency.

Kick Timing
Video analysis has revealed some interesting information on the timing of the
pull and kick that differs from the technique taught by many coaches and from
what the athletes perceive. The main findings from watching the top athletes
execute the stroke is that the legs remain straight and outstretched while the
arms are pulling back and the kick doesn’t engage with the water and push water
back until the arms are fully extended and the head is nearly in line.
This observation is contrary to traditional thought and teachings. The phrase
“kick your hands forward” is commonly used to instruct athletes how to execute
the breaststroke kick with proper timing. This phrase means that a swimmer is
kicking while the hands are recovering forward. The rationale behind this teach-
ing is that the power produced by the kick counteracts the forward movement of
the hands, which is a nonpropulsive, drag-creating movement. Likewise, while
the knees are bending and the feet are coming up toward the hips, the arms are
pulling backward to counteract that nonpropulsive kick setup. Although this
idea seems to make a lot of sense, what happens in reality makes more sense.
In reality, the knees do not bend and the kick does not begin to set up until
the end of the inward sweep of the hands. Some elite breaststrokers do not even
start to bend the knees until the arms are moving forward at the beginning of
the recovery. This timing of starting the kick makes sense because in this way
the swimmer can gain the maximum benefit from the arm pull without any
opposition or resistance from the legs. The legs and hips remain high in the
water in a great line as the arms are pulled backward.
Looking at the other end of the stroke, the kick, the feet and legs push against
the water and propel the body forward just as the upper body and head are get-
ting in line with the arms extended forward. This timing makes sense because
the swimmer can gain maximum benefit from the kick when the upper body
is in line. The key is for the upper body to get in line—another reason that the
body press is important—and not just extend the arms forward. Video analysis
shows that the kick is engaging and pushing back when the head is just getting
in between the arms, regardless of when the arms are fully extended forward.
Frequently, swimmers and coaches talk about late timing. Late timing can
be easy to spot. It occurs when the surge of the kick does not look coordinated
with the arm recovery. The viewer sees two forward surges, one from the arms
extending forward and one from the kick, instead of one single surge forward.
Late timing is often easier to recognize than it is to remedy. Most people try to
correct this by starting the kick sooner, thinking that an earlier start will make
the kick fire backward earlier in the cycle so that it coincides with the arm recov-
ery. This approach rarely addresses the root cause of the problem—the kick isn’t
engaging early enough because the head and upper body are not getting in line
quickly enough. The arms may be shooting forward, but the upper body isn’t
lunging forward in coordination with the arms; therefore, the kick is late. To
fix late timing, the coach must first make sure that the body is pressing forward
dynamically with the appropriate timing.

Breaststroke Technique 81
Essentially, the best timing for fast breaststroke swimming is for the swimmer
to hold the legs in line with the body for as long as possible while the arms pull
and then kick when the upper body is fully extended and back in the proper body
line. The mantra should be pull when the legs are streamlined and kick when
the upper body is streamlined. Understanding that fast breaststroke swimming
is as much about managing drag forces as it is about generating propulsion, it
makes sense that all the best breaststrokers use this timing. Working within the
confines of this timing means that the setup of the kick, from when the knees
start to bend to when the heels are as close to the hips as possible, has to take
place in a very short time—the time that it takes for the hands to recover for-
ward. Therefore, the feet have to come up quickly. Dave Salo, PhD, one of the
best breaststroke coaches, calls it “fast heels” and constantly preaches the idea
to his athletes. Bringing the heels up has to be a fast and dynamic motion, one
that really engages the hamstrings. A world-record holder breaststroker has said
that his hamstrings are totally taxed at the end of a race. That fatigue results
from the quick recovery of the feet to set up the kick.
Knee Drop
As the feet are drawn up to the hips, the knees bend and drop down. The knees
must drop deeper in the water so that the feet remain under the surface of the
water during the leg recovery and do not break the surface and push against air
during the execution of the kick.
Some coaches and athletes are concerned about the knee drop because the
deeper the knees are in the water, the more drag is created by the thighs, which
are directly opposing the oncoming flow of water. Indeed, resistance does increase
as the knees go deeper and the angle between the thighs and the waist becomes
closer to 90 degrees. But the tradeoff needs to be weighed to determine the best
body position during the leg recovery.
For most swimmers, the resistance created with the thighs will be negated by
the propulsion developed from setting up the feet as high as possible, so they
should choose that option. Only one or two world-class breaststrokers do not
bring their heels all the way up to the buttocks when setting up the kick. Olym-
pic medalist and national champion Eric Shanteau, whose breaststroke kick is
highly regarded, has such leg anthropometry that when he brings his heels up,
the angle created by the thighs is nearly 90 degrees. Another factor to consider
is that the kick should occur quickly. The quicker the feet recover, the shorter
the time will be that the knees will be dropped and producing drag.
Kick Width
In terms of width of the kick, the knees should generally be angled slightly out
just before the propulsive phase kick is executed and should be aligned just
outside the waist, around the width of the shoulder. The knees should have a
gap between them throughout the duration of the kick; they should not come

--- Page 93 Text ---
}
82 Mark
together. After the feet reach their highest point in the recovery and begin the
push backward, they generally go slightly wider than the knees as they come
around to catch water. As the legs extend rearward, the feet should come closer
until the legs are fully outstretched behind the swimmer and in line with the
rest of the body.
The overwhelming majority of the propulsion from the kick comes from
water being pushed by the insides of the lower legs and the insides of the feet.
Little propulsion comes from the two legs first separating (abducting) and then
squeezing together (adducting). The general nature of the breaststroke kick is
that of a leg extension that finishes downward. The emphasis should be on the
extension aspect of the kick as opposed to the downward aspect because the aim
should always be to push water back to move the body forward. The downward
aspect of the kick is a result of the physical position of the legs from where they
are set up to extend backward; the legs need to have a slightly downward push
so that the insides of the legs and feet can apply direct pressure on the water. If
the feet remained close to the surface throughout the extension of the legs, the
legs would be sliding through the water and not pushing directly against it to
create propulsion.
Foot Position
From the start of the kick, when the feet and knees start to extend backward, the
feet should be rotated outward at the ankles so that the toes point toward the
side of the pool and the insides of the feet face backward. This position should
be referred to as the catch of the breaststroke kick because it is the position at
which the feet engage in pushing water back. The more the feet can turn outward,
the more water will be caught and pushed. Ankle flexibility and the ability to
rotate the feet outward are important, and those who have a natural propensity
for this movement are at an advantage for generating an effective kick. Those
who do not have that natural flexibility can work on it with regular stretching
exercises to improve.
Kick Finish
The legs extend downward to the finish of the kick. With the upper body in
line throughout the propulsive part of the kick, the backward and downward
extension of the kick transfers through the hips and then forward through the
upper body. The feet will be slightly separated by the time the legs are straight,
so the feet will finish coming together as they rise to the surface so that the legs
get into a horizontal line with the rest of the body.
Underwater Pullout
Every length of breaststroke starts with one full pull and kick cycle taken
completely underwater. Since 2005 a single dolphin kick is allowed during the

--- Page 94 Text ---
|
Breaststroke Technique 83
underwater pullout, and most questions surrounding the dolphin kick have to
do with when the kick should be performed.
Arm Movement
Before covering the details of the dolphin kick, we need to explain the basic arm
movement of the underwater pullout. It differs from the pull in the regular swim-
ming stroke in that the arms pull all the way back to a straight arm extension
next to the sides of the body before recovering forward. The underwater pullout
is more similar to the butterfly arm stroke than the breaststroke arm stroke.
From a streamline position, the hands separate, the elbows remain high, and
the hands try to grab and push as much water backward as quickly as possible.
Throughout the pullout, the elbows are bent and the fingertips are pointing
downward. The hands and arms move straight back just wide of the body. Keep-
ing the arms and elbows anterior to the body is important. A common flaw is
for the chest to press downward and the arms to be higher than the body, which
is a much weaker position to pull with. Tightening the core while initiating the
arm pull can help optimize the effectiveness of the arm pull.
Body Line
As with the regular swimming stroke, the most important thing to focus on when
executing the pullout with a dolphin kick is maintaining a good body line. A
good body line is essential to taking advantage of any speed created off a start,
turn, pulldown, or dolphin kick.
When completely submerged, a good body line consists of being flat and
horizontal in the water in the same position as swimming the breaststroke at
the surface, but achieving this body line can be more difficult while underwater
because the swimmer doesn’t have the reference of the surface of the water to
help determine the horizontal plane. The legs may float upward or the upper
body may press downward, so the swimmer needs to develop greater awareness
to keep the entire body level. The good body line needs to be established before
and after the arm pulldown and dolphin kick.
Dolphin Kick Timing
The rule for implementing the dolphin kick states that the dolphin kick can occur
any time before the first breaststroke kick. Prior to 2015, the rule stated that the
dolphin kick had to occur during the arm motion of the pulldown. There is now
less ambiguity in regard to an official determining a rule infraction, which is a
positive change for all swimmers.
For most swimmers, the proper timing when performing the dolphin kick is
to initiate the kick at the beginning of the arm pull, specifically after the hands
separate and before the arms start to pull down toward the feet. The kick should
be compact, primarily from the knees with minimal body movement. After

--- Page 95 Text ---
}
84 Mark
finishing the downward dolphin kick, the body should almost immediately be
returned to a good body line. Ideally, the finish of the dolphin kick will have
minimal follow-through and the swimmer will kick herself into a good line.
Many swimmers who attempt to perform the dolphin kick in the middle
of the arm pull end up in a poor body line at the end of the pull and dolphin
kick. When the finish of the dolphin kick is combined with the finish of the
pulldown, the natural tendency of the body is to bend at the waist and end up
in an upside-down V shape. Not every swimmer who performs the dolphin kick
in the middle of the pulldown has this problem, but it is definitely common.
Some key points for making the dolphin kick work effectively in a pullout are
to keep the kick compact (not make it as big as possible) and to make the kick
come primarily from a knee bend (not a whole-body motion).
Recovery
After completing the arm pulldown, the swimmer should wait a short time before
recovering the arms above the head. The swimmer needs to make a judgment
call here about this length of time, waiting until just before he is about to slow
down before initiating the arm recovery.
During the recovery, the hands remain close to the front of body with the
palms facing upward toward the body. Some breaststrokers like to keep the elbows
out to the sides of the body as they bring their arms up. Other breaststrokers
prefer to bring their elbows in close to each other and close to the body as well.
Either way, the idea is to keep a low profile with the arms and sneak them up
above the head as quickly as possible.
Summary
Despite the perception that breaststroke is a complicated and individual tech-
nique to teach, many key elements can be taught to every swimmer to achieve
the best breaststroke possible.
Each stroke starts and ends with a great body line. From fingertips to hips to
toes, the body is in the same horizontal plane just underneath the surface and
the head is between the arms. The head can be tilted slightly forward as long
as it is in line.
All the best breaststrokers drive the body and arms forward into that great
body line. The head and body, not just the arms, must press forward into the
line. Making this action dynamic is important so that the arms and body do not
dive downward into the water, which will compromise the body position as it
arches back up to the surface.
The optimal pull shape allows the body to drive forward, which allows the
great line to occur. The pull shape should be round with no sharp corners so
that the hands can transition smoothly from the pull, or propulsive, phase to the
dynamic recovery phase. The pull starts with an outward scull, continues with
an inward motion with the hands pitching down and getting deeper, and then

--- Page 96 Text ---
|
Breaststroke Technique 85
transitions to the recovery with the elbows staying wide and hands converging
along the way. The head and upper body rise during the inward motion, allow-
ing the breath to occur.
An important aspect of the kick is to bring the heels up quickly. This action
enables the ideal timing in breaststroke—pull with the legs to streamline and
then kick with the upper body in streamline. The knees bend and come forward
at about hip width during the setup of the kick. When the feet push back during
the propulsive part of the kick, the swimmer should focus on extending the legs
and pushing water with the inside of the feet and calves.
Instinctively, swimmers try to pull harder and faster to speed up in breast-
stroke. Unlike in freestyle, backstroke, and butterfly, this approach isn’t optimal
in breaststroke. To get more speed in breaststroke, swimmers should fire the kick
earlier and glide less.
Although many swimmers perceive things as black or white and view them-
selves as either good breaststrokers or bad breaststrokers, keeping an open mind
to all these concepts can help anyone get faster. A swimmer’s kick effectiveness
may be limited by ankle flexibility, but many other aspects of the stroke can be
easily worked on and improved.

CHAPTER
Butterfly Technique
—Ross H. Sanders, PhD, and Carla B. McCabe, PhD
In this chapter we describe the technique of butterfly swimming and ways to
enhance swimming performance and proficiency. Specifically, the chapter looks
at the importance of having a wavelike sequencing of undulations of the body
segments, the phases of the stroke and their links to the undulations, and the
effects of breathing and changes of pace on technique. Ultimately, by focusing
on these fundamental aspects of butterfly technique, swimmers will be able to
swim faster and more efficiently.
Description of Butterfly Technique
Butterfly is a symmetrical stroke in which the actions of the right upper and
lower limbs are almost simultaneous with those of the left. The body undu-
lates upward and downward rather than rolling around the longitudinal axis
as in front crawl and backstroke swimming. Thus, butterfly is regarded as an
undulating stroke.
In front crawl and backstroke, the timing of the arm and leg actions is linked
to the timing of the rolling actions of the body. In butterfly the kick is linked
to the vertical oscillations of the body parts (Sanders 2011). When watching
a good butterfly swimmer, a wave appears to be travelling along the length
of the body. The undulation of the body parts in a skilled butterfly swimmer
mimics a moving wave of water travelling progressively from the head to the feet
(Sanders, Cappaert, and Devlin 1995). In contrast, an unskilled butterfly swim-
mer doesn’t seem to have the flow or the rhythm and often looks awkward and
jerky.

88 Sanders and McCabe
Therefore, just as the body roll establishes the rhythm in front crawl and
backstroke, the wave moving along the body controls the rhythm in the butterfly
stroke and influences the timing of the actions of the arms and legs. Indeed,
they go hand in hand. The stroking and kicking actions are set to the rhythm
of the body wave, which in turn is influenced by the timing of the arm and leg
actions (Sanders 2011).
Given that rhythm is crucial to well-coordinated butterfly swimming, teach-
ers and coaches should focus on developing rhythm early in the learn-to-swim
program rather than trying to establish the butterfly arm action. Experienced
swimming teachers know that swimming butterfly with a smooth and economi-
cal technique is extremely difficult until swimmers have developed the ability
to undulate the body in a wavelike manner. Thus, learn-to-swim classes com-
monly include activities designed to develop this undulating rhythm, such as
by mimicking the actions of dolphins.
The rhythm is closely tied to the kicking action. In fact, the kick is highly
propulsive in butterfly swimming and the stroke is not efficient without an
effective kick that is the culmination of a full body wave (Sanders, Cappaert,
and Devlin 1995). Because the upper-body undulations start the wave moving
along the body toward the feet, learners should be told that the kick starts in
the chest rather than from the hips. After the body wave and kick feel natural
and well coordinated, the arm action can be superimposed.
Benefits of Undulations
Butterfly swimming is exhausting and uneconomical until the wavelike rhythm is
established. The purpose of waves is to transmit energy from one place to another.
A wavelike rhythm in butterfly swimming transmits energy from the upper body
to the lower limbs to generate propulsion from the kick (Sanders 2011).
To enable breathing and recovery of the arms, work must be done to raise the
upper body. In doing so, the upper body stores gravitational potential energy,
so called because the upper body now has the potential to move downward
under the influence of gravity and gain kinetic energy (the energy resulting
from movement). As the upper body rotates downward into the water, much
of the potential energy is changed to kinetic energy because of its rotation.
The wavelike sequence of rotations of the trunk, thighs, and shanks transmits
this kinetic energy to the feet to contribute to their work to propel the body
forward. Therefore, some of the energy expended by the swimmer to raise the
upper body is conserved in the body and simply moved from one body part
to the next until it is reused to propel the body forward. Because some of the
energy used in the kick comes from the movements of the upper body, the
whole stroke is less exhausting than it is when the swimmer does not have the
wavelike sequencing of body parts. Therefore, developing coordinated undula-
tions of the body is essential for efficient butterfly swimming.

Phases of the Stroke and Links to Undulations
In this section we explore how the phases of the stroke are linked to the rhythm
of the body wave. The elements of good technique emerge from the swimmer’s
attempts to ensure that his actions are timed appropriately to maximize swim-
ming efficiency and minimize resistive forces through effective use of the body
wave.
Release and Recovery
Given the link between the body undulations, energy transfer, and economical
propulsion, a good place to start the description of the butterfly stroke cycle is
when the hands release the water at the end of their pull and start the over-water
recovery in preparation for the next pull.
At the instant of release, the body is loaded with mechanical energy. It has
high kinetic energy because it is moving fast following the completion of the
underwater pull combined with a downward kick. The body also has gravita-
tional potential energy because the head and parts of the upper body have been
raised (figure 5.1). A good butterfly swimmer will be able to use this potential
energy to produce the next body wave that in turn contributes to the propulsion
gained from the second kick.
 Figure 5.1 Butterfly stroke release as the hands exit the water and initiate recovery
of the arms over the water. Notice that the head and shoulders are clear of the water
without being so high that the body is steeply angled to the water, which would cause
excessive drag.

90 Sanders and McCabe
Because butterfly is a symmetrical stroke, both arms recover together, so the
rotational effects of one arm are cancelled by the rotation of the other arm in
the opposite direction. The swimmer can therefore maintain good alignment
of the body in which the body’s long axis remains in line with the direction of
travel. Balancing the rotational effects of the recovery of each arm means that,
unlike front crawl and backstroke, butterfly does not require a high recovery
in which the upper limbs are kept close to the midline of the body. This point
is convenient because the height of the recovery is limited by the shoulder
structure and, unlike in front crawl, cannot be assisted by a body roll about the
longitudinal axis of the body.
The upper limbs and body are elevated sufficiently to clear the water but do
not need to be higher than that. Indeed, the recovery of butterfly world-record
holder Michael Phelps is lower than that of many butterfly swimmers. Even so, the
recovery of the arms needs to be sufficiently high that the arms are not sweeping
water as they move forward because this action causes unnecessary resistance.
One of the problems encountered by beginning butterfly swimmers is that they
cannot get the arms sufficiently clear of the water. This difficulty may be linked
to either not raising the upper body sufficiently or not having sufficient shoul-
der flexibility. Obtaining suitable upper-body elevation is much easier after the
wavelike rhythm is established because the kicking actions maintain the upward
and downward oscillations of the upper body without great effort. The swim-
mer’s efforts should be directed toward horizontal motion rather than pulling
the upper body upward. With proper timing and correct actions of the arms and
legs, the upper body and shoulders are above the water until the arms, forearms,
and hands have recovered sufficiently far forward to avoid sweeping the water.
Entry
Approaching entry, the forward rotational motion of the body combined with
the effects of the gravitational force drives the upper body downward. By this
time the elbows need to be sufficiently high and the arms sufficiently forward
to avoid sweeping the water. Internal rotation of the shoulders helps achieve
this. The instruction to achieve the required internal rotation is simply to turn
the hands so that the thumbs are pointing downward toward the bottom of the
pool. The trunk is now almost level, and the head is flexing downward to enter
before the arms do.
To keep the upper limbs free of the water and to bring them close to the midline
for an entry that minimizes resistance, good shoulder flexibility is required. With
the arms now recovered well forward, the arms and upper body can dive into
the water. The downward dive is assisted by a modest downbeat of the feet that
tends to rotate the body forward (figure 5.2). This downbeat does not need great
effort because it takes advantage of the energy transmitted to the lower body by
the pendulum-like rotation of the upper body. A body wave has transmitted the
energy from hips to feet. This action is an excellent example of saving energy
through transfer of motion from one body part to another.

--- Page 102 Text ---
|
Butterfly Technique 91
 Figure 5.2 During the entry phase, the trunk and head dive
downward. This forward rotation is assisted by the downbeat kick
force of the legs.
Flexion of the neck before and during entry is important for two reasons. First,
it creates a diving action to enter the water and continue the downward motion
to penetrate the water with minimum resistance because of form and wave drag.
When the head is not submerged, the body is angled to the oncoming water
flow, presenting a large surface area that generates resistance. Thus, the drag is
so significant that forward progress is achieved only with great effort that is not
sustainable. Second, the downward rotation of the upper body continues the
pendulum-like motion of the trunk and the energy exchange between potential
and rotational energy. The head moves through a large range of vertical motion,
and the shoulders follow as part of the wavelike sequencing from head to feet.
Submerging the head commences a body wave that progresses along the body
fast enough to be propulsive (Sanders, Cappaert, and Devlin 1995; Sanders
2007, 2011). Therefore, submerging the head and upper body below the surface
is essential to developing proficiency in butterfly.
While the shoulders are moving down, the hips are moving up. Energy is being
transmitted to the lower body by a pendulum action of the upper body about
an instantaneous axis of rotation that is somewhere between the shoulders and
hips. The body wave also assists in raising the hips and lower limbs to maintain
good alignment and thus minimize drag effects.
Outsweep and Catch
At the beginning of the outsweep, so called because the arms sweep outward
rather than backward, the arms have reached forward, the trunk is angled
downward, the hips are elevated, and the legs are up near the surface (figure 5.3).
The internal rotation of the shoulders has put the arms in a strong position to
move the hands outward immediately after entry and encourages continuity of
motion. If the swimmer has been able to complete the inward motion of the
arms, forearms, and hands before entry, then the downward motion during
entry can naturally round out into the outsweep.
A common fault among beginning butterfly swimmers is to continue the
downward motion of the upper limbs into a backward pull rather than outward.
This action disrupts the rhythm. Skilled butterfly swimmers use the outsweep

to create lift force to reverse the downward motion of the upper body, allowing
the pendulum to start swinging back the other way and to continue the wave-
like motion. The internal rotation of the shoulders naturally orients the hands
so that the little fingers are slightly higher than the thumbs. This orientation,
in combination with the outward motion, produces a lift force that starts the
upper body moving upward (figure 5.4).
A second mechanism tending to reverse the downward motion of the torso
is the buoyancy force. The center of buoyancy is now in front of the center
of mass and tending to swing the pendulum back the other way (figure 5.5).
 Figure 5.4 Shoulder internal rotation and hand orientation during
the outsweep phase in butterfly swimming. As the hands sweep
outward, a lift force is created that acts to reverse the downward
motion of the upper body to maintain the undulation that creates
the body wave.

 Figure 5.5 During the outsweep phase, the buoyancy force is
shifted in front of the center of mass, resulting in a reverse turning
effect (torque), that is, the wave action changing from a forward to
backward rotation.
These mechanisms of reversing the downward rotation and producing backward
rotation are then supported by the strong upbeat of the feet. Besides starting the
pendulum swinging back and keeping the rhythm going, the outsweep places
the hands in a strong position to make the catch, that is, to move the hands
backward to generate propulsive force during the insweep.
During the transition to the insweep, the outward motion rounds out and the
hands pronate to commence the insweep and make the catch.
Insweep
The insweep in butterfly is not unlike that of front crawl except that both arms
are working at once and no body roll occurs about the longitudinal axis (figure
5.6). The lack of body roll means that the pull of each arm is wider with respect
to the midline. But if the hands produce similar force with lines of action equi-
distant from the midline of the body, the torques produced by right and left arm
actions cancel out and the body maintains its alignment.

 Figure 5.7 The hourglass pattern scribed by the hands from the
commencement of the (a) outsweep, (b) insweep, (c) upsweep, and
(d) release.
The similarities of the butterfly insweep to the front crawl insweep include
flexing the elbow and combining shoulder internal rotation, horizontal adduc-
tion, and extension to produce great hand speed and, therefore, strong propulsive
forces. The hands move inward toward the midline and backward to the neck
of the hourglass (figure 5.7) that is characteristic of the butterfly pull pattern.
The hourglass pattern has advantages besides enabling a strong lever system.
First, the hands are moving a longer distance than they do if they are moved
straight back as beginning swimmers commonly do. Second, the hands perform
sweeps in terms of changing directions throughout the underwater pull, allow-
ing them to find still water rather than pushing the same column of water and
losing force (Maglischo 2003). Third, at the end of the insweep, the elbows are
partly flexed and the shoulders are in a midrange position. Thus, the lever system
is set to apply large forces through a combination of shoulder internal rotation,
shoulder extension, and elbow extension (figure 5.7c). Fourth, the hands can
move outward from the narrow part of the hourglass, thereby assisting the exit
and a continuous rounding out into the recovery (figure 5.7d).
During the insweep, the trunk continues to rotate back as part of the pendu-
lum action, transmitting energy to the lower body that contributes to the kicks.
By the end of the insweep, the powerful upbeat of the feet has finished and the
powerful downbeat is about to commence (figure 5.8).

Butterfly Technique 95
Upsweep
As in the front crawl, the insweep blends seamlessly into the upsweep. The
upsweep is a strong backward push that also brings the hands toward the sur-
face. A transition occurs from internal rotation to a backward push in which
elbow extension, shoulder extension, and shoulder abduction are prominent.
This action is fast and strong, and the hands accelerate progressively through
the upsweep (Maglischo 2003). But unlike in the front crawl, body roll cannot
assist the action.
Maintaining a high elbow throughout the upsweep to release and exit is impor-
tant for pushing water backward rather than upward. The latter is a common
fault that has the undesired effects of sinking the body because of the downward
reaction force and making the recovery awkward and uneconomical.
During the upsweep, the downbeat of the second kick occurs. This kick, in
combination with the upsweep, produces propulsion and elevates the center
of mass. The hands naturally move outward and round out into the recovery.
Much of the rotational motion of the upper limbs gained in the upsweep carries
through into the recovery, thereby saving energy by not having to restart the
forward motion of the arms from a stationary position. Swimmers should try
to maintain a high elbow position as the hands exit the water to help ensure a
clean exit with the hands pushing back, rather than upward, until exit.
Effects of Breathing
and Changes of Pace on Technique
Butterfly swimmers, particularly in shorter events, do not breathe every stroke.
Hahn and Krug (1992) found that taking a breath in butterfly swimming reduces
the swimmer’s velocity primarily because of increased trunk inclination angle
(10 degrees), which naturally increases frontal resistance compared with breath
holding. Comparing frontal and lateral breathing techniques, Alves et al. (1999)
found that the latter resulted in a lower trunk inclination but also induced an
unwarranted rotation of the whole body around the longitudinal axis. The
authors concluded that one technique was not necessarily superior to the other.
Despite evidence to suggest that breathing in butterfly swimming negatively
affects swim velocity, one question that has frequently been asked is, “Does the
rhythm differ between breathing and nonbreathing strokes?” Recent research by
Seifert, Chollet, and Sanders (2010) indicates that breathing causes propulsive
discontinuity because of a longer glide time to facilitate catching the water to
elevate the trunk and head before breathing. But Seifert, Chollet, and Sanders
also reported better synchronization between hands exiting and the downbeat
of the legs when breathing compared with breath holding. This finding was
associated with facilitating the head’s exit from the water for an inhalation
without improving propulsion because of the shorter duration of the push phase.
Therefore, these authors concluded that breathing significantly influences the

--- Page 107 Text ---
}
96 Sanders and McCabe
change of coordination parameters in terms of stroke phase durations when
incorporating a breath into the butterfly stroke cycle. They thus recommended
that coaches monitor those changes in training.
Conversely, Sanders, Cappaert, and Devlin (1995) indicated that the wave
progressed consistently along the body regardless of whether it was a breathing
or a nonbreathing cycle. This finding suggests that the fundamental rhythm
involving progression of a wave remains across breathing and nonbreathing
cycles yet does not constrain the system from adjusting timing and duration of
component parts of the stroke to adapt to the differing requirements of breath-
ing and nonbreathing stroke cycles.
Examination of butterfly swimming across various race paces (Seifert et al.
2007; Seifert, Chollet, and Sanders 2010) revealed that the pattern of timing
between kick and arm actions remained similar across race paces but became
more synchronous and exhibited greater propulsive continuity with increasing
pace. They reported that glide time decreased as a function of increasing race
pace. These authors attributed longer duration of the glide phase with slower
race paces (associated with longer swims) as a strategy to conserve oxygen by
remaining in a streamlined position longer and thus obtain an instant of rest at
each stroke. At higher race paces, a longer glide phase would be undesirable and
should be avoided so that propulsive continuity can be maintained. Moreover,
the fact that the pattern of timing remained similar across race paces suggests
that adjustments such as changes in pace can be made without changing the
fundamental rhythm embodied in the travelling body wave (Sanders 2011). That
is, the fundamental wavelike rhythm characteristic of skilled butterfly swimmers
is stable and endows the system with the capacity to adjust to changes in pace
and to alternation of breathing and nonbreathing cycles.
Summary
In this chapter we described the butterfly technique, stressing the importance of
obtaining an effective rhythm in which the parts of the body undulate to produce
a body wave that is transmitted from head to feet. The benefits of this undu-
lating wave were explained in terms of contributing to propulsion at minimal
energy cost. The characteristics of the arm stroke and leg kick were described,
and their timing was linked to the undulations. Finally, the effects of breathing
and change of pace on technique were discussed.

CHAPTER
Techniques for Starts
and Turns
—Andrew Lyttle, PhD, and Brian Blanksby, PhD
In international competitions the trend is for smaller time differentials to
separate competitors. The difference between first and eighth place can hinge
on how well a swimmer executes his start and turns (Newble 1982). Swimmers
achieve their fastest speeds off the start, and maximizing performance in this
area presents an opportunity to gain a substantial advantage over competitors.
Looking more closely at the turns, pushing off the wall generates the next highest
race velocities. Additionally, when the underwater phase is considered, we find
that the turns make up as much as 30 percent of the distance covered in a race.
The complex interrelationship of actions required to optimize performance
in these areas has led to a large variation in techniques used in competition.
Research has tended to focus on discrete areas of start and turn performance,
and tremendous emphasis has been placed on understanding the underwater
phase. Additionally, new technologies such as computational fluid dynamics
have increased our knowledge of efficiency in these skills and revealed how best
to prepare elite swimmers for competition. This chapter presents the existing
research and knowledge about start and turn performance and extends those
findings to provide application-based recommendations for optimizing perfor-
mance in the pool.
Dive Starts
The benefits of an effective start in competitive swimming cannot be underesti-
mated. Evidence from race analyses conducted at major international competi-
tions demonstrates significant correlations between faster start times and race
times (Cossor and Mason 2001; Mason, Alcock, and Fowlie 2007). The start

produces the fastest velocity that a swimmer will achieve during a race. When
you consider that the start includes the first 15 meters of the race, it makes up a
considerable proportion of the total event, especially in the shorter sprints over
50 to 100 meters (figure 6.1).
Consider these examples of how start performance can affect performance:
• A review of Olympic swimming results from 1972 to 2004 showed that a 0.1
second improvement in time, a difference that realistically can be achieved
with a better start, would have resulted in 65 medals changing hands in
sprint events (Hoof 2007). More recently at the 2008 Beijing Olympic
Games, the top two competitors in the female sprint events (50 meters and
100 meters) were typically separated by less than 1 percent (Slawson 2010),
again an amount that can be affected by a start.
• An analysis of the 100-meter men’s butterfly final at the 1996 Olympics
showed that the eventual silver medalist was 0.4 seconds slower to 15 meters
than the winner, but his final time was only 0.28 seconds slower (Schnabel
and Kuchler 1998); the faster swimmer placed second and essentially lost
the gold medal in the first 15 meters.
The bottom line is that although less time is spent on the start than is spent
swimming, starting is still a crucial skill to master at the elite level (Miller, Allen,
and Pein 2003; Hay 1988).

Types of Dive Starts
The grab start and the track start, with variations in which body weight is posi-
tioned forward or backward, are the most commonly used start techniques.
The major differences between the grab start and track start are how the feet
are placed on the block and how the athlete’s body weight is distributed with

regard to the base of support. The technique employed by a given swimmer is
selected in part based on personal preference, but the design of the starting
block can also have an influence (Pearson et al. 1998). FINA, the international
governing body of swimming, requires that starting blocks be constructed with
a 0- to 10-degree slope and a height between 0.5 and 0.75 meters above the
water (www.fina.org/rules/rules_index.htm). Thus, the swimmer can encounter
considerable variability at a competition. Additionally, FINA recently approved
the Omega OSB11 starting block for use in international competitions, which
has the potential to alter optimal start technique considerably. This block has
an inclined kick plate at the rear and side handles, which will further affect the
type of start that athletes use. The addition of the FINA-approved backstroke
feet wedges is likely to see further modifications in the backstroke starting
technique and times.
The basic techniques for the block starts are presented in the sections that
follow. The backstroke start will be addressed separately, later in the chapter.
Grab Start
The grab start is similar to a two-legged jump. To begin, the swimmer places
the feet about 0.15 to 0.30 meters apart and curls the toes over the front edge of
the block (figure 6.2). The hands grasp the front edge of the block, either inside
or outside the feet. In this position, the swimmer’s center of gravity (CG) is in a
position of dynamic stability, positioned as far forward as possible within the
base of support to allow for rapid movement forward. The arms are crucial in
developing the initial forward momentum as they pull down and back against the
block. Both arms then swing straight out toward the far end of the pool as both
legs drive powerfully and simultaneously off the block (Houel et al. 2010). Kruger
et al. (2003) showed that the knee and hip extensors are the main contributors
to the takeoff forces generated by the legs, and the back muscles are preactivated
to enable a more powerful extension of the body at the starting signal.

Track Start
The track start gets its name from the fact that it mimics the start used in a track
sprint; the legs are staggered, and the start is performed by generating an initial
drive with the rear leg followed by a front-leg drive.
The track start has two main variations: the traditional front-weighted track
start, in which most of the swimmer’s weight is over the front leg, and the
rear-weighted track start, in which the swimmer leans back slightly so that her
weight is directed more over the back leg. In both cases, one foot is placed near
the rear of the block and the other is positioned with the toes curled around the
front edge. Because the front leg provides more of the total propulsive force, it is
logical that this should be the athlete’s dominant leg (Benjanuvatra, Edmunds,
and Blanksby 2007).
When performing the front-weighted track start (figure 6.3), the swimmer
grasps the front edge of the block with both hands but does not lean back,
keeping the CG positioned closer to the front of the block. On the starting
signal, the swimmer initially pulls down and back against the block with the
arms while explosively pushing back with the rear foot. When the CG passes
the front edge of the block, the front leg dominates force production and con-
tinues to accelerate the body forward and upward (Benjanuvatra, Edmunds, and
Blanksby 2007). Like the grab start, this type of start can be performed quickly.
It potentially enables the swimmer to enter the water earlier than when using
the rear-weighted track start.
This rear-weighted track start (figure 6.4) is an adapted version of the tradi-
tional track start and requires the performer to lean back as much as possible,
thereby preloading the muscles of the upper back leg and the front leg. Because
the swimmer leans back, the swimmer’s CG is initially positioned more toward
 Figure 6.3 The front-weighted (traditional) track start. Note how
the athlete’s weight is positioned over the front leg.

the rear of the block. This positioning typically means that the swimmer will have
a longer block time than when executing other dive starts. Advocates claim that
this disadvantage is offset by the fact that the longer time allows the swimmer
to generate force for a longer period and subsequently produce a greater impulse
(a product of force multiplied by time). The result is that the rear-weighted track
start typically produces greater takeoff velocity. In addition, the preloading or
prestretch of the muscles of the arms and shoulders can increase their force
production because of the length-tension properties of muscle (Welshe, Wilson,
and Ettema 1998; Vilas-Boas et al. 2000). The arms are used almost exclusively
to initiate horizontal propulsion. Then, after the swimmer is moving forward,
the legs further accelerate the swimmer. This type of start has been suggested
as being beneficial for swimmers who are able to generate a high level of upper-
body power.

Dive Start Comparisons
Regardless of the type of dive start used, the swimmer’s ultimate goals are the
same: to react quickly when the starting gun sounds, leave the blocks rapidly at
an appropriate takeoff angle, and achieve as much forward velocity as possible.
But the inevitable tradeoffs mean that it is not possible to maximize all these
factors in one start. For example, although a grab start allows a swimmer to react
quickly, the longer block time in the track start allows a swimmer to generate
higher takeoff velocity. Consequently, studies comparing the start techniques
usually produce conflicting results about which is best. Although some have
suggested that the grab start is superior to the track start (Zatsiorsky, Bulga-
kova, and Chaplinsky 1979; Counsilman et al. 1988; Kruger et al. 2003), other
studies have found no difference between the grab and track starts (Blanksby,
Nicholson, and Elliott 2002; Vilas-Boas et al. 2003; Miller, Allen, and Pein 2003;
Benjanuvatra et al. 2004), and a third group has concluded that the track start is

superior (Welcher, Hinrichs, and George 1999; Holthe and McLean 2001). The
lack of definitive evidence makes it difficult for coaches to choose a best starting
technique to teach their athletes. The contradictory findings can be attributed
to a number of factors, such as the skill level of performers, length and scope
of interventions, body morphology, and swimmers’ familiarity and experience
using specific dive techniques. Comparing techniques is inherently difficult when
swimmers have their preferred starts that they have practiced almost exclusively;
the adage “What one does most, one does best” often applies. Only when a new
technique, despite being more complex or less practiced, yields better results can
useful information be drawn. For example, athletes can perform handle start
dives (Blanksby, Nicholson, and Elliott 2002) and kick start dives (Honda et al.
2010) as proficiently as their preferred starting style, despite having never tried
handle or kick starts before.
The lack of consensus among the block start studies can be partially attributed
to the various criteria used to define a successful start. A variety of criteria have
been used in studies for evaluating starts, including takeoff velocity, velocity at
15 meters, distance travelled in a streamlined position after the start, or the time
to a set distance (e.g., time to 5, 10, or 15 meters). As highlighted by Welcher,
Hinrichs, and George (1999), however, few studies of start techniques have used
multiple measures (e.g., both temporal and velocity characteristics). Doing this
sort of analysis is crucial to capturing all the characteristics of a successful start.
In optimizing start technique, swimmers and coaches must consider the
inherent tradeoff between the time on the block and the amount of velocity that
can be generated at takeoff. When examining the basic physics involved, the
swimmer’s takeoff velocity is determined by the impulse-momentum theorem
F × t = m × Δv,
which states that the takeoff velocity is a function of the force that the swimmer
can produce as well as the time over which that force is generated. To achieve a
greater takeoff velocity, a swimmer needs to either create more force or gener-
ate a force over a longer time (e.g., longer block time). A dive technique with a
shorter block time might be inferior to another technique that can generate a
much greater takeoff velocity because the swimmer stays on the block longer.
But the converse is also possible if the swimmer takes too long on the starting
block and cannot make up the accrued time deficit. An ideal start would allow
a swimmer to generate a greater impulse without increasing block time.
A more diligent approach to training the start often leads to greater improve-
ments in performance. In other words, practice leads to proficiency. One group
of researchers found no significant difference in 10-meter start times between the
track and the grab starts before and after a training intervention for experienced
competitive swimmers. But significant improvement was found in dive starts for
both techniques after they were practiced, reinforcing the idea that the amount
of dedicated practice, not the dive technique, is what most significantly affects
start performance (Blanksby, Nicholson, and Elliott 2002). Although the dive

start techniques were not specified, Hong (1999) provided auxiliary feedback
to Chinese elite swimmers and found that the swimmers were able to decrease
their times to 10 meters by 0.73 to 0.90 seconds.
Implications of the Recently Approved Starting
Block Configurations
The recent decision by FINA to allow starting block configurations that have an
adjustable slanted rear footrest or the addition of side handles has the potential
to have a substantial influence on the start performance of swimmers. The adjust-
able footrest (commonly termed kick plate) on the Omega blocks can be moved
forward and backward at set positions along the block to allow swimmers to use
a crouch start and have the rear-positioned leg achieve a 90-degree knee angle
(figure 6.5). The kick plate conceivably allows the rear leg to produce more force
and generate higher horizontal velocities than can be developed with a track
start on a traditional block. Further research is required to determine whether
the swimmer’s dominant leg would be better positioned at the front or rear of
the block with this new configuration.
Several studies suggest that the new block configuration can have an effect on
start performance. Honda et al. 2010 indicated that when compared with starts
performed on a traditional block, starts that use the kick plate can significantly
decrease block time and time to five meters, increase the force output of the rear
foot, and increase horizontal takeoff velocity. In a separate study researchers
found that on a custom-built instrumented block, a rear incline (at 36 degrees
to horizontal) led to a less than 2 percent increase in horizontal velocity and a
3 percent decrease in the time to six meters when compared with the traditional
start platform (Vint et al. 2009). This same study reported more significant

benefits from the use of handles at the side of the block compared with the kick
plate. These block modifications appear to favor the track start more than the
grab start, so we may see a gradual phasing out of the grab start in international
competition as these new block designs are used.
Force Development Characteristics
As a swimmer pushes off the block, force is generated and applied against the
starting block, which in turn pushes back against the swimmer according to
Newton’s third law—for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
The applied force can be broken down into vertical, horizontal (antero-posterior),
and lateral (side-to-side) components and produce the swimmer’s takeoff veloc-
ity. Downward force application into the blocks accelerates the body vertically
(increased height), and the component of the force directly backward generates
propulsion in the forward direction. Any lateral force is essentially wasted and
should be minimized. In the track start, however, some lateral force is unavoid-
able because the legs contribute to force generation at different times (Benjanu-
vatra et al. 2004).
The way that the three components of force are generated dictates the takeoff
velocity of the swimmer and the resultant momentum that the swimmer carries
through the air. The interplay of the horizontal and vertical forces also deter-
mines the angle at which the swimmer’s CG leaves the block. Generating more
vertical force makes the angle of takeoff steeper; if a swimmer generates more
horizontal force, the angle of takeoff will be flatter. Other information that can
be derived from the force profiles includes the swimmer’s reaction time, defined
as the time from the starting signal to the first movement. Note that electronic
displays of swimmers’ reaction times at various competitions actually display
the swimmers’ block times—the combination of both reaction time and move-
ment time on the starting block—which can vary considerably depending on
the start used.
Force Development Profiles
A number of researchers have examined how force is developed for the differ-
ent start types (Arellano et al. 2000; Kruger et al. 2003; Vilas-Boas et al. 2003;
Benjanuvatra et al. 2004; Honda et al. 2010). Sample force profiles for the grab
and standard (forward-weighted) track starts are shown in figures 6.6 and 6.7.
Although the initial movement of swimmers pulling against the starting block
with the arms is similar for both grab and track starts, subtle differences can
be identified from the force-time curves. In the grab start, this effort is applied
mainly in the vertical direction, reflecting the action of the arms pulling the
body toward the starting block (represented by first elevation of the vertical force
curves, region 1 on figure 6.6a and b). Conversely, the arm action in the track
start appears to generate impulse in both the horizontal and vertical directions
(region 1 on figure 6.6c and d).

In the horizontal direction, the grab start is characterized by the gradual
development of force, reaching a peak just before the swimmer leaves the block.
In contrast, the horizontal force for the track start develops earlier and is followed
by two separate peaks. The first peak corresponds to the push-off from the rear
foot, and the second peak corresponds to the push-off from the front foot (figure
6.6). Aggressive arm action and a strong rear-leg drive are used to generate force

and forward momentum in the early part of the dive, but the front leg typically
generates the major propulsive force on a traditional starting block (figure 6.7).
The greater contribution of the front leg is likely because of the forward position
of the swimmer’s CG at takeoff. Greater vertical force is developed by the front
leg at the beginning of the start, and both legs contribute considerably during
the middle and later parts of the front-weighted track start. Although Honda et
al. (2010) and Vint et al. (2009) have measured the total horizontal force using
a back kick plate compared with traditional starting blocks, neither group of
researchers has reported on the relative contribution of the front and rear feet.
Contribution of the Upper Limbs
in Force Development
Placing the fingers under the lip of the starting block before the start in all dive
types helps to increase the level of pretension in muscles through the upper body
and legs. Kruger et al. (2003) found that the use of the arms before the grab
start mainly increases back extensor muscle activity and enables a more forceful
extension of the back during the initial phase of the start. This preloading also
increases the vertical force that a swimmer can generate because the swimmer
can press down into the blocks to a greater degree than otherwise possible.
In the track start, swimmers show a much higher level of muscle activation
(pretension) in the upper-body musculature, which aids in the forceful arm
actions used to drive the body forward initially. Differences in pretension seen
between start types arise from the position of the swimmer’s CG for each starting
technique. In general, the farther back the CG is, the greater the muscle preload
is. The pretension probably reduces the reaction time required to initiate move-
ment and increases the effectiveness of the force production because the muscles
are already highly activated (Welshe, Wilson, and Ettema 1998).
Limb Dominance and Symmetry
Asymmetric force production is expected during the track start because of the
asymmetric nature of the movement, but contributions from the left and right
legs should be equal in the grab start in both the horizontal and vertical direc-
tions (Benjanuvatra et al. 2004). Table 6.1 provides a summary of the percentage
differences found between the left and the right sides in the horizontal and verti-
cal forces produced by 16 national-level swimmers when performing grab starts
(Benjanuvatra et al. 2004). In the vertical direction, 7 of the 16 subjects recorded
a greater than 10 percent difference in the average vertical force produced. An
example of an asymmetric vertical force profile with the corresponding impulse
plot (area under force and time curves) is illustrated in figure 6.8.
The influence of asymmetric force applied on the starting block during a
grab start is unknown, but any significant asymmetry could result in subopti-
mum starting performance. Possible negative effects could include rotation in
the body and displacement in the lateral direction away from the direct line of

projection. Swimmers would need to make some adjustments in the air or after
entering the water.
Feedback on the force profile generated by a swimmer is increasingly being
used for testing and optimizing the performance of elite swimmers. But this is
only one aspect of start performance, and it should be integrated with other
analysis techniques to develop a full characterization of a swimmer’s starting
technique. For example, a component-based system that provides force, inte-
grated vision, and wireless three-axis acceleration data has been developed for
feedback to assist British swim coaches in improving start performance (Cossor
et al. 2010).
Takeoff and Water Entry Angles
Unfortunately, the optimal takeoff and entry angles needed to maximize start
performance are currently unknown. The dive entry has implications for the
underwater glide because it dictates the initial drag conditions that the swimmer
experiences. This entry angle will be determined, at least in part, by the swim-
mer’s takeoff angle and body movements while in flight. In general, a higher
takeoff angle creates a steeper entry and reduces the distance travelled in the
air. A higher takeoff angle also results in a deeper glide, which adds to the time
required to return to the surface.

--- Page 119 Text ---
}
108 Lyttle and Blanksby
Conversely, a lower takeoff angle creates a flatter entry and can result in
nonoptimal performance. A greater body surface area contacts the water, and
the glide depth is shallow, both of which increase drag on the swimmer and
reduce glide distance. Studies of elite swimmers have found that they use take-
off angles (defined as the angle that the CG travels relative to horizontal as the
feet leave the block) between −5 degrees and +10 degrees (Arellano et al. 2000;
Holthe and McLean 2001; Miller, Allen, and Pein 2003). These findings sug-
gest that a relatively flat takeoff is beneficial to elite performance. Other results
have demonstrated that elite swimmers tend to enter the water at angles of 30
to 40 degrees (Counsilman et al. 1988; Holthe and McLean 2001). Pike entries
typically trend closer to 50 degrees and result in a steep entry and increased
underwater depth. Takeda et al. 2008 simulated entry and takeoff parameters
and recorded maximum flight distance (3.36 meters) at a takeoff angle of 11.8
degrees but maximum horizontal velocity (4.49 meters per second) at a takeoff
angle of −18.7 degrees.
Another crucial factor in determining start performance is the body position
at water entry. Variations in the swimmer’s position at entry have a marked effect
on the rate of deceleration experienced in the water. Despite the obvious impor-
tance of a streamlined entry, this aspect is still typically executed poorly, even
at the elite level. Common technique flaws include dropping the head, separat-
ing the hands or feet, and slightly flexing the ankles or knees, any of which can
dramatically increase drag on entry and rapidly decelerate the swimmer.
Backstroke Starts
The backstroke starting technique (figure 6.9) is unique, being the only swim
start initiated in the water. This start has received little biomechanical research
and exhibits considerable variation at the elite level. The backstroke start can
be subdivided into four phases (Hohmann et al. 2006):
1. Initial reaction phase from the starting signal until movement is initiated
2. Pressure phase from first movement until the hands leave the wall
3. Jump phase from when the hands are off until the feet leave the wall
4. Flight phase from when the feet are off until the hips enter the water

Techniques for Starts and Turns 109
Studies of elite backstrokers have shown that during the reaction and pres-
sure phases, swimmers tend to produce repeatable patterns of muscle activation,
whereas during the jump and flight phases, they tend to show greater intra-
and interindividual variability (Hohmann et al. 2006). In a study of nine elite
backstrokers, the resultant force against the wall correlated significantly with
the time to 7.5 meters and higher wall push-off forces led to faster start times
(Kruger et al. 2003). In this study, significant positive correlations were found
between the times to hands off the block and when the feet leave the wall, as
well as the times to hands off the block and hip entry, although these were not
related back to starting performance.
Recent rule changes in backstroke allow swimmers to start with their feet
emerging from the water surface. De Jesus et al. (2010) compared backstroke
starts with feet fully submerged and feet above the surface. Greater flight time,
less total start time, and greater horizontal displacement of the center of mass
were found when starting with feet submerged. Starting with the feet above
the water, however, produced greater impulses and times of hands-off and foot
takeoff. Vilas-Boas et al. 2009 also found that the submerged-feet position led
to faster five-meter times and a tendency for higher forces against the wall when
compared with a starting position with the feet above water.
Relay Starts (Changeovers)
Until recently, the relay start has been performed using a modified grab start
with the toes curled over the end of the block and the arms used to track the
incoming swimmer before being thrown forward to generate momentum. In
contrast to the start of the initial relay swimmer, the subsequent swimmers have
the advantage of being able to increase their forward momentum while on the
blocks and therefore increase the takeoff velocity. To this end, many nonleadoff
swimmers incorporate an approach, or stepping motion, on the blocks into the
start. Researchers have investigated the effectiveness of these approach relay
starts and have found no significant differences in start times compared with
traditional relay starts (Gambrel et al. 1991; McLean et al. 2000). In a study by
Takeda et al. (2008), using a one- or two-step start increased the changeover
times and caused several disqualifiable dives compared with a no-step start. But
because of the complex timing required to become proficient in these approach
start techniques, increased practice may result in these starts becoming more
effective.
Swimming Turns
When taking into account the time spent underwater and approaching the
wall, turn time can account for up to one-third of total race time. Thus, minor
improvements in turn performances can significantly influence race results.
Figure 6.10 (Hay 1992) presents a theoretical model that outlines the myriad

factors that contribute to turn performance. As with many other areas in swim-
ming, tradeoffs within these factors must be considered when trying to optimize
turn performance (Hines 1993). An increase in one variable could reverberate
favorably or detrimentally on other components that also affect performance.
This chapter focuses predominantly on the flip turn (or tumble turn) of freestyle
and backstroke, but a number of the points made can apply to the two-handed
touch and open turns (or pivot turns) for breaststroke and butterfly strokes. The

Flip, or Tumble, Turn Technique
The freestyle flip turn (or tumble turn) has evolved into its current form largely
because rule changes no longer require any hand touch during the turn. The
rotation, wall contact, and wall push-off used in freestyle also have many simi-
larities with the current backstroke rollover turn. Hence, research results for
freestyle have some translational crossover to backstroke turns.
The freestyle flip turn includes the approach, rotation, wall contact, underwater
glide, and stroke preparation phases. Note that although specific characteristics

of each phase are described, successful variations by swimmers at all levels of
competition have been observed within each of these phases.
Approach Phase
The approach refers to the time that the swimmer takes to prepare for the turn,
and it is typically defined as starting a fixed distance from the wall (e.g., 5 or 7.5
meters) and lasting until the forward somersault begins with the arms by the
swimmer’s sides. The swimmer sets up the turn in this phase by coordinating
breathing and timing to maintain momentum into the wall. Positioning the
arms by the side in the somersault is accomplished either by stopping one arm
at the end of the pull and waiting for the other arm to pull through and join it
or by stopping one arm at entry and allowing the other arm to catch up with it
before executing a two-handed pull back to the hips.
The distance out from the wall where the forward somersault starts varies
with the skill level and anthropometric dimensions of the swimmer. Blanksby,
Gathercole, and Marshall (1995, 1996) found that faster age-group swimmers
tended to initiate their turns farther from the wall than less experienced swim-
mers did. A maximum knee flexion of around 110 to 120 degrees may be optimal
at wall contact (Takahashi et al. 1983; Pereira et al. 2006) because this technique
decreases the swim-in distance by about 15 centimeters and therefore starts the
swimmer’s push-off 15 centimeters farther from the wall, a distance saving of
0.3 meters with each turn compared with turns performed with greater knee
bend. This more extended position provides less resistance because the body is
already semistreamlined and therefore does not need to move as large a mass
of water at push-off. Turns performed closer to the wall cause the body to be
bunched up on the wall, which takes additional time and produces more drag.
This knee angle of about 120 degrees suggested by Blanksby and associates is
also in the range at which peak dynamic torque can be generated by the knee
extensors (Thorstensson, Grimby, and Karlsson 1976).
Hitting the wall moderately hard and pushing off fast from a semistreamlined
position maximizes use of elastic energy that can be stored in the leg muscula-
ture (Lyttle et al. 1999). Bending the knees or sinking into the wall after contact
dissipates any stored elastic energy and increases the passive wall contact phase,
both of which should be discouraged (Wilson, Elliott, and Wood 1991). Although
swimmers can wind up for a big push-off using fully flexed knees and hips, they
must travel closer to the wall and present a larger frontal resistance over a longer
period, which inherently creates high drag forces and incurs a high energy cost
(Lyttle et al. 1999).
Rotation Phase
The rotation phase of the turn, from the end of the approach until the feet hit the
wall, can be initiated in various ways. The most common way is to flex the head
and spine in conjunction with performing a pronounced dolphin or freestyle
kick to drive the head and shoulders down and raise the hips. The increased

--- Page 123 Text ---
}
112 Lyttle and Blanksby
resistance experienced by the head and shoulders as they move out of alignment
with the rest of the body, together with the propulsion produced by the final
kick, causes the swimmer to somersault forward. In the second common method
of initiating the turn, the swimmer omits the dolphin kick but swims down the
wall to commence the somersault part of the turn. The swimmer then flexes the
upper body about the hips and tucks the knees close to the chest to reduce the
distance from the axis of rotation and decrease the moment of inertia, which
increases the speed of rotation. The swimmer then opens up the tuck position in
the latter stages of the somersault to slow the rotation for an effective foot plant.
This technique also prevents overrotation, whereby the feet end up deeper than
the body at wall contact. A poor tuck position typically leads to a slower rotation
in which the swimmer continues drifting toward the wall. This slow rotation
can lead to an underrotation in which the feet are higher than the body at wall
contact. This drift also increases the chance of a bunched-up turn with a large
knee bend and an associated increase in wall contact time.
Elite swimmers tend to fall into two broad groups when looking at body posi-
tion as the feet make contact with the wall. Many short-distance-event swimmers
perform a straight somersault and initiate wall contact in a predominantly supine
position (on the back) before rotating to a prone position (on the front) throughout
the wall push-off and glide. In a more traditional turning style, the swimmer twists
about the body’s longitudinal axis approximately 150 degrees when performing the
turn. The swimmer then has to rotate only a small amount after leaving the wall.
The optimal amount of long-axis rotation has not been defined and may vary
based on swimmer-specific factors. Elite competitors have shown success with
longitudinal rotation anywhere from 0 to 180 degrees, but these turns may not
be performed optimally. Intuitively, how a swimmer pushes off on the back could
potentially result in less time on the wall, but greater skill is required to ensure
that the upper body remains streamlined through the push-off.
With either technique, the arms must be rapidly extended over the head as the
turn is executed so that the upper body is streamlined at wall push-off. Common
errors to look for are excessive arching of the back and attempts to produce the
rotation throughout the push-off, which leads to suboptimal twisting force
application.
Wall Contact Phase
The wall contact phase commences when the feet contact the pool wall and fin-
ishes at toe-off (Nicol and Kruger 1979). Research has shown that the swimmer’s
feet should hit the wall at a depth of approximately 0.3 to 0.4 meters (Lyttle et
al. 1998; Prins and Patz 2006) to ensure the appropriate depth and trajectory
of the subsequent push-off. Typically, It is common to see swimmers either
overrotate or underrotate, which will cause foot placement to be either too low
or too high, respectively. Their push-offs from the wall are then misdirected
as they head toward the surface or the pool bottom. Or they may adopt other
compensations such as arching the back.

Techniques for Starts and Turns 113
The most effective use of push-off forces occurs when the ankles, hips, and
shoulders are aligned (figure 6.11). Swimmers should aim for a near-horizontal
torso with the arms extended overhead before starting the push-off to minimize
the frontal surface area and drag and to increase streamlining during the push-off.
A slight negative angle might be required to place swimmers at a preferred depth,
but the forces should still be directed through the ankles, hips, and shoulders.
The degree of hip and knee flexion at wall impact varies among swimmers.
Blanksby, Gathercole, and Marshall (1995) proposed a variable called the tuck
index as the ratio of the smallest hip-to-wall distance to total leg length. The
amount of tuck has been found to be negatively correlated with turn times. This
finding suggests that the larger the tuck index is (i.e., the straighter the legs are),
the faster the turn is.
As mentioned earlier, the recommended knee angle at wall contact is around
110 to 120 degrees. But the combined angles at the knees and hips are critical
when optimizing the wall push-off, because collectively they determine how
forcefully the major propulsive muscles in the legs, many of which cross both
joints, can contract. Excessive flexion or extension at one joint will compromise
how the muscles function at the other. The nature of muscle contraction sug-
gests that an optimal level of contraction would enable both muscle groups to
work in their midrange longer to provide greater force than when they operate
at greater length (Blanksby, Gathercole, and Marshall 1996). Knee flexion to
less than 90 degrees places the quadriceps muscles, the prime muscle group for
the wall push-off, at an inefficient length, which in turn inhibits the swimmer’s
ability to produce force quickly.
Wall contact time can be separated into the passive and active force production
phases. An optimal push-off should minimize the passive phase and maximize
the active phase while keeping the total wall contact time to a minimum (Lyttle
et al. 1999; Prins and Patz 2006). The passive force production phase consists of
the initial wall impact and any countermovement (eccentric contraction of the
a

quadriceps) that occurs. The active force production phase includes the forceful
extension of the knees and hips as well as plantar flexion of the ankles to create
velocity away from the wall.
Using a 3D force plate mounted in the wall, Puel et al. (2010) found that the
best female swimmers developed maximum horizontal force early in the push-
off phase and that maximum horizontal force and glide duration were related
to better turn performance. Lyttle et al. (1999), on the other hand, have shown
that it is not just about where the peak force occurs. Rather, optimal performance
is a balance among the peak push-off force, the time spent pushing off the wall,
and the resultant peak drag that is produced. This summary makes sense because
large forces generated early in the push-off will cause the body to accelerate while
in a nonstreamlined position, resulting in increased drag.
Figure 6.12 highlights some of these findings and displays three push-off
force profiles underlying different force production strategies. In this case, the
best push-off was performed by swimmer C, who, although she did not have
the highest impulse, had an active pushing phase that equaled 90 percent of the
total wall contact time. Combined with a low drag force, this method allowed
the swimmer to achieve the highest exit velocity of the group—3.03 meters

per second. In short, a high final push-off velocity was achieved by an optimal
combination of low peak drag force (i.e., proper depth and good streamlining),
high peak propulsive force, and a wall push-off time of sufficient duration to
develop this force (in other words, not as fast as possible but long enough to
generate a large impulse). Of these variables, lower peak drag force was found
to be the best predictor of the final push-off velocity.
In an ideal situation, any type of kinetic (force) analysis should be performed
while also looking at video of the turn, because what could be considered an
efficient push-off from a kinetics point of view may be offset by poor body
position and streamlining. Having stated that, force curves contain a great
deal of information and can yield a wealth of data about turn performance to
the trained eye. Figures 6.13 to 6.16 present force traces that highlight several
turning flaws, in which the solid line represents the horizontal force generated
during push-off. For reference, figure 6.13 illustrates a good turn in which force
is developed consistently throughout push-off. The peak force occurs closer to
takeoff when the swimmer is in a streamlined position. Curves with multiple
peaks usually mean that segment coordination is not optimal (figure 6.14) or
that a substantial settling phase occurs on the wall (e.g., an impact phase occurs
at contact when force generation is not being used to propel the swimmer off
the wall; figure 6.15). Additionally, if peak force is generated too early in the
push-off (figure 6.16), the swimmer will experience excessive drag, resulting in
suboptimal performance.

Open, or Pivot, Turns
The turning motions used in breaststroke and butterfly open turn (or pivot turn)
techniques are essentially the same action. The main differences occur in the
underwater phase that follows the push-off. The open turn (pivot turn) is initi-
ated in both strokes with a simultaneous two-hand touch with the shoulders
parallel to the water surface, as dictated by event rules. Because breaststrokers
now incorporate one dolphin kick underwater as part of the split stroke (i.e.,
glide, pull–push of hands to hips, dolphin kick, arm recovery to overhead with
a breaststroke kick before surfacing), butterfly turns more closely resemble
breaststroke turns than ever before. The same principles of body alignment,
development of force, and other features of the push-off that were discussed
for the flip turn (or tumble turn) can be related to the open turn (pivot turn)
(Blanksby et al. 1998). Additionally, the timing of the strokes leading into an
open turn (pivot turn) is important to prevent an excessively long glide into
the wall and subsequent loss of momentum (Ling et al. 2004; Walker et al.
1995).
Using regression equations, Huellhorst, Ungerechts, and Willimczik (1988)
found that the important criteria for fast breaststroke turns were short pivot
times and high velocity at push-off. A newly proposed breaststroke and butterfly
turn is the apnea turn (Kishimoto et al. 2010), which is completed underwater.

The theory is that open turns cause increased wave resistance around the water
surface and that this resistance would be reduced underwater. The authors found
that, except for the longer pivot time (perhaps because of insufficient practice),
the apnea turn was faster overall and achieved higher wall push-off velocity in
a five-meter round-trip time, including velocity of turn in and out, velocity of
approach, and glide out (Kishimoto et al. 2010).
Underwater Phases
The underwater phase after a start or turn is when the swimmer travels fastest
(Chatard et al. 1990). Elite swimmers typically enter the water from a dive start
at between 4.50 and 5.50 meters per second (Benjanuvatra et al. 2004) and push
off the wall after turning at between 2.60 and 3.20 meters per second (Lyttle et
al. 1999). In contrast, free-swimming velocity, which represents the velocity at
which swimmers should initiate stroking, ranges from 1.60 to 2.20 meters per
second. Hence, an efficient glide and underwater kick before stroke resumption
are integral to maximizing start and turn performance.
Glide Phase
Coaches and swimmers should be mindful that increased swimmer speed
increases the drag experienced. Therefore, a swimmer should aim to minimize
the resistive forces by holding a streamlined position and kicking at the optimal
depth underwater.
Studies of drag forces when towing swimmers underwater at different speeds
and depths have found that hydrodynamic drag decreases with increasing depth
and decreasing velocity (Lyttle et al. 1998; Maiello et al. 1998; Marinho et al.
2010). In terms of optimizing the depth that a swimmer should be underwa-
ter, research has shown that swimmers should aim to perform their glides at
a depth of approximately 0.5 meters underwater to benefit from reduced drag
forces (figure 6.17). Any additional increase in glide depth did not produce any
substantial reduction in drag force. Despite being a popular strategy for some
elite-level swimmers, a deeper glide depth should be discouraged. With that said,
the optimal glide depth following a turn will likely need to be slightly deeper
so that the swimmer gets under the surface turbulence generated by the swim-
mer on the inbound leg of the turn. The optimum glide depth should gradually
decrease the closer the swimmer gets to stroke resumption.
Form drag and wave drag are important factors in determining the total drag
force experienced by the swimmer. Therefore, the swimmer must hold a good
streamline throughout the glide without excess body movements. Small devia-
tions in body positions can have a large effect on the drag characteristics (Roig
2010; Wada et al. 2010). Common faults during the glide include not having
the hands together and not having the arms fully extended above the head,
lifting or lowering the head, and having the feet apart (laterally or vertically)
and toes dorsiflexed. An efficient glide depth and streamlined pathway increase

the glide distance covered in the same time and improve the underwater phase
performance (Prins and Patz 2006).
Traditionally, our understanding of drag and propulsive forces occurring on
the streamlined body is derived from towing tests with swimmers in the water.
But estimating the forces acting on the various parts of the body is now possible
using high-level fluid dynamics modeling, such as computational fluid dynamics
(CFD). Keys and Lyttle (2010) compared the drag forces experienced by every
major body segment of a swimmer in a streamlined position when gliding at the
surface and underwater. Although an overall net increase in drag force occurred
at the surface (as expected), the upper-body segments (122 percent increase in
drag force) were responsible for all the increase in drag force (Keys and Lyttle
2010). The lower-body segments all recorded significant reductions in drag force
(104 percent reduction in drag force). The feet changed most drastically, from
being an area of drag to propelling the body forward (Keys and Lyttle 2010).
The authors attributed this change in drag across the body to the influence of
the linear wave formation close to the water surface with concurrent areas of
positive and negative acceleration across the wave formation affect the drag
across the swimmer's body.
Stroke Preparation and Underwater Kicking
The stroke preparation phase consists of underwater kicking before break out
for the first stroke cycle. For freestyle, butterfly, and backstroke, the dolphin
kick has become the preferred underwater kicking style. Clothier et al. (2000)
demonstrated that the deceleration was less during underwater dolphin kicking

than during flutter kicking, and the velocity above that of free swimming was
maintained longer with dolphin kicking underwater. Lyttle et al. (2000) found no
significant differences in the net forces (propulsive forces minus resistive forces)
between the underwater dolphin and flutter kicks when towing elite swimmers,
although the dolphin kicks tended to produce better propulsion. The kicking
style adopted by a given swimmer will likely depend on the streamlining posi-
tion used, the stroke being swum, and swimmer and coach preferences.
Again, CFD analyses have started to provide greater insight into how drag
and propulsion are generated over the body in underwater kicking patterns.
Lyttle and Keys (2006) compared two patterns of underwater dolphin kicks
(large, slow kicks versus small, fast kicks). Using a case-study approach on an
elite swimmer, the researchers determined that, for the approximate range of
velocities experienced during underwater kicking (2.40 meters per second down
to 1.50 meters per second), a large, slow underwater dolphin kick showed less
momentum loss at lower velocities and virtually no difference at a velocity of 2.40
meters per second. In a follow-up study, Keys and Lyttle (2010) compared these
two underwater dolphin kicking techniques to the underwater flutter kick at a
single velocity of 2.18 meters per second. Although the underwater dolphin kick
generated greater propulsion, the total net thrust was greater for the underwater
flutter kick, as evidenced by a lower total momentum loss. This resulted from
more consistently applied propulsive forces in the flutter kick than the dolphin
kick, which showed larger periods of deceleration.
In kicking, the relative importance of having flexible ankle joints has never
been quantified, despite the fact that, anecdotally, the more effective underwater
kickers tend to have better flexibility through a range of joints, particularly the
ankles and knees. To illustrate the capabilities of the CFD modeling technolo-
gies, Keys and Lyttle (2010) varied an elite swimmer’s ankle flexibility in the
analysis to examine the effects on the swimmer’s net thrust during underwater
dolphin kicks. A 10-degree increase in ankle plantar flexion (the ability to point
the feet down) allowed the swimmer to generate an additional 16N of propulsion
from the feet during the dolphin kick downsweep, roughly a 66 percent increase
in the peak force created at the feet. The effect of increased flexibility changes
at different kicking velocities, but the general trend of the benefits will be the
same. This research provides important information to coaches on the effects
of flexibility on the generation of propulsion while kicking.
The optimum time to initiate underwater kicking presents another oppor-
tunity for improving start and turn performance. Observations of swimmers
across varying levels have shown that underwater kicking can be, and often is,
initiated at any stage, from immediately after the dive entry or wall push-off to
after arm stroking has resumed. Intuitively, by starting the kick immediately, the
drag created by deviating from a streamlined body position will likely exceed
any propulsive force benefit created by kicking. Conversely, by waiting too long
before initiating underwater kicking, the full benefits of the underwater kick
will not be realized. These assumptions were confirmed by Lyttle et al. (2000),

--- Page 132 Text ---

Techniques for Starts and Turns 121
who used towing experiments and found that most swimmers should wait for
approximately one second after the wall push-off of a turn before initiating any
underwater kicking (Lyttle et al. 2000; Sanders 2003). With that said, this recom-
mendation depends highly on the swimmer’s underwater kicking proficiency.
A similar rule of thumb for glide time has not been proposed for the dive start,
but this period would probably be slightly longer than the one-second period
recommended after wall push-off given the higher initial velocity experienced
after the dive entry.
A common problem highlighted by these studies is that swimmers frequently
lose time by gliding or kicking too long or too little before starting to stroke with
the upper body (Blanksby, Gathercole, and Marshall 1995, 1996; Hubert et al.
2006). In the first case, swimmers decelerate to less than their free-swimming
velocity and they need additional time and energy to get back up to race veloc-
ity. Conversely, when stroking is commenced too early, the swimmer’s speed
is still higher than the free-swimming velocity and any propulsive movements
effectively slow the swimmer down unnecessarily.
Poor streamlining is another common error encountered in swimmers of
all ages and abilities. Blanksby et al. (2004) found that two-thirds of male and
female age-group backstrokers did not hold the streamlined position long enough
to gain optimum distance from the wall and that the premature initiation of
stroking resulted in increased deceleration back to the free-swimming velocity.
The remaining one-third maintained the streamlined glide too long. This error
was typically a result of pushing off at too great an angle. The return to stroking
thus came at below free-swimming speed, and significant energy was required
to regain race pace.
Breaststroke Underwater Phase
After performing a fast spin at the wall, breaststrokers prepare for the important
underwater phase (Blanksby et al. 1998; Goya, Takagi, and Nomura 1999). During
the underwater phase of breaststroke start and turns, swimmers choose a time to
execute an extended underwater arm pull–push to the hips, followed by a single
underwater breaststroke kick (split stroke). Breaststrokers then break out to the
surface before the regular arm action commences. Again, little research exists
on the mechanics of the breaststroke start, especially given the new rules that
allow the use of the underwater dolphin kick and subsequent rules that allow the
dolphin kick and underwater breaststroke actions to be separated. Towing tests
have shown that the second streamline position in the breaststroke glide phase
(with the arms alongside the body) leads to higher and more variable drag forces,
highlighting the need to ensure that good body position is maintained in this
phase (Costa et al. 2010). Likewise, although anecdotal evidence clearly shows
the benefits of including the underwater dolphin kick, no research has examined
the effectiveness or timing of this kick. Traditionally, swimmers have used the
dolphin kick immediately following the arm pull, but an alternative technique
was popularized by former 100-meter world-record holder Kosuke Kitajima of

Japan in which the dolphin kick is performed at the start of the underwater arm
pull. Breaststroke starts and turns present particular challenges because there are
several freely chosen moments when swimmers must streamline—arms pull–
push to the hips, dolphin kick, breaststroke kick, arm recovery, and break out.
Summary
Swim starts and turns represent critical components of a swimming race. Refin-
ing these skills is integral to being competitive at the elite level. At a practical
level, dedicated practice of starts and turns within a swimmer’s daily training
environment is likely to lead to improvement, but an understanding of the prin-
ciples that lead to more efficient skill development and refinement increases the
performance gains that this training can produce. Research into starts and turns
is usually confounded by interactions of the numerous components that make up
the performance. These interactions create tradeoffs in which overemphasizing
one component can negatively affect other components. Isolating the optimal
combination of the variables that affect each of the starts and turning skills is
the key to providing useful, practical information to swimmers.
Despite the shortage of definitive outcomes of research into swim starts and
turns, coaches and sports scientists can apply logical mechanical principles to
assist with technique prescription on a case-study basis with each swimmer. The
body of research can be used to support the coach’s rationale for a technique
change. An understanding that the swimmer’s inherent technique is likely to feel
more comfortable should not dissuade the coach from attempting to optimize
phases of the starts and turns. A change should be attempted only if a logical
thought process and basic data support the proposed change that has been tai-
lored to the individual swimmer.

Swimming techniques used at the elite level typically arise from a mix of natural
genetics, feel for the water, knowledge from experienced coaches, and some
trial and error. Although these techniques are considered highly efficient, little
is known from a hydrodynamics point of view about what makes any technique
better or faster than another.
We know that a complex interaction of forces exists as swimmers move through
the water. But to date, the exact mechanisms that create propulsion and minimize
active drag during swimming are unresolved. In general, the three options for
increasing swimming velocity are to increase the total propulsive forces, mini-
mize the total resistive forces, or ideally both. For coaches and sport scientists
to apply technique changes with these options, a thorough knowledge of the
mechanisms that generate propulsion and drag force development is essential.
Unfortunately, the ability to quantify the relative effects of flow patterns experi-
mentally when swimming, and the resultant forces that are produced, is limited
at best and provides only approximations of total-body effects.
This chapter presents a full-body analysis of a world-class freestyle sprinter
using a new analysis tool called computational fluid dynamics (CFD). This type
of analysis can provide considerable insight into how swimmers can effectively
increase propulsion while reducing drag throughout the entire swimming stroke
(Keys and Lyttle 2008).

Tools for Technique Analysis
Before embracing a new technology and learning how it can enhance the under-
standing of swimming technique, it is helpful to know what tools of measurement
are currently used to assess swimming mechanics. For free-swimming investiga-
tions, relatively few testing methods have allowed any comprehensive, noninvasive
analysis of swimming. Research has usually incorporated one or several of the fol-
lowing methods to estimate what is happening throughout the swimming stroke:
• Video-based kinematic analysis to quantify variations in swimming velocity
and the timing of key phases throughout the stroke cycle
• Inertial sensors, such as accelerometers, to measure accelerations of body
segments throughout the stroke
• Physical testing using force plates, drag lines, or towing devices to estimate
the total net forces generated by or acting on the body
• Numerical modeling and analysis of recorded flow lines and vortex patterns
as measured by injecting dye or using particle image velocimetry methods
to visualize how fluid particles move around the body
• Computer-based numerical modeling that uses estimations of drag and
inertia effects of shapes similar to those of human limbs to predict how
they interact with water
Each of these systems provided valuable information and some empirical data
about a few of the many questions concerning the best way to swim. But because of
methodological limitations and the complex fluid flows around irregularly shaped
human bodies that are always changing shape and position, no methods thus far
have provided a complete picture of the influential features occurring throughout
a full swimming stroke cycle. With that said, technology makes regular advances
that improve the ability to analyze swimming technique.
This chapter discusses one such emerging technology available for analyzing
swimming: computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Some consider CFD to be the
future of swimming research. It enables athlete-specific, full-stroke analyses to
explain how and where propulsive and drag forces are produced for optimal
performance.
CFD can be used to model and solve complex problems of fluid flow, and it is
ideally suited to analyze drag and propulsion across the body when swimming.
Using known physics and fluid dynamics relationships, CFD allows complex fluid
flow regimes and geometry to be simulated within a computer environment. In
fact, CFD has been used successfully to optimize performance in a variety of
sports. These efforts include assisting in the design of a bobsled and understand-
ing the dynamics of how the seams on a soccer ball affect its flight characteristics.
CFD can be used to visualize fluid along a swimming body and to calculate any
number of performance-related variables, such as velocity, acceleration, and force.
Thus, CFD analyses can provide answers and insights into problems that have
been unobtainable through traditional physical testing techniques. To date, CFD

predictions of forces acting on a swimmer have been limited to studies of passive
drag (Bixler, Pease, and Fairhurst 2007), hand motion through the water (Bixler
and Riewald 2001; Sato and Hino 2002), and underwater kicking (Lyttle and
Keys 2006; Von Loebbecke et al. 2009). These CFD studies have begun to fill a
gap in testing procedures and have simplified the mathematical modeling that
to date has been used primarily to determine both the passive and active drag
components and frictional, pressure, wave, and inertial forces.
Besides increasing the foundational knowledge of swimming mechanics, these
CFD studies have begun to provide meaningful and practical information that
can be applied on the pool deck. An example of this is the underwater dolphin
kicking CFD study by Lyttle and Keys (2006). The results demonstrated that
when underwater dolphin kicking, a 10-degree increase in ankle plantar flexion
(the ability to point the feet down) created 16N greater peak propulsive force by
the feet during the dolphin kick downsweep. This represents approximately 5.5
times the average force created by the feet over the whole of the downsweep,
or nearly a 17 percent increase in the total average force created by the entire
body during that same period, because of the contribution of other segments in
creating the propulsion. Although the relative contribution of increased ankle
flexibility changes with different kicking velocities and for different swimmers,
the general trend is the same—increased plantar flexion increases kicking force.
This information about the potential beneficial effects of greater ankle flexibility
for generating propulsion while kicking underwater is important to coaches.
A limitation of some early computerized CFD studies is that they restricted
their focus to one aspect of swimming (e.g., just the arm pull) or one section of
the race (e.g., immediately after the start or after pushing off the turning wall),
and they do not capture the complete picture of events during a swimming race.
For example, the winner of the 50-meter freestyle at the 2008 Australian Olympic
Trials touched in a time of 21.28 seconds. Using race analysis techniques similar to
those presented in chapter 6, it was subsequently found that he spent just over 6
percent of the race underwater after the start, either gliding or kicking in a stream-
lined position (conditions often modeled in CFD analyses), and 87 percent of the
total race time free swimming, a condition not yet studied using CFD. Although
performance gains may still be made by optimizing start and turn performance,
major competition advantages will come from improving the techniques used
during the free-swimming portion of the race. Therefore, this chapter examines
how technology can be used to measure full-body swimming mechanics and
provides the initial steps toward calculating when the major propulsive and drag
forces are created within a full freestyle stroke of an elite swimmer.
CFD Analysis of a Full Swimming Stroke
Using CFD, a case-study approach was undertaken to examine the propulsive and
drag forces experienced across and around the body during full-body freestyle
swimming (Keys 2010). The participant in this study, Eamon Sullivan, was the
50-meter and 100-meter freestyle world-record holder when tested. Therefore,

the technique examined can be considered highly evolved and effective. Note
that, as with any technique analysis, some findings will be specific to this
athlete. Several common features, however, could be applied to other freestyle
swimmers as coaches and scientists better understand the critical factors that
affect performance.
In this chapter we cannot describe all the nuances and complexities of run-
ning a CFD analysis, but we can identify some of the main technologies and
methods that render these simulations a reality. More information on general
CFD theory is covered by Versteeg and Malalasekera (1995), and more in-depth
information on the dynamic CFD model developed for this work can be found
in Keys (2010). In general, any dynamic CFD model requires two important
components.
The first is a detailed 3D mapping of the swimmer’s body shape using a laser
scanner (figure 7.1). In this case, the resultant scan produced a highly detailed
mesh made up of approximately 100,000 triangular surface elements. The total
simulation consisted of between 2 and 5 million cells. Of this vast number of
cells, three to five layers of prism cells are located at the swimmer’s body surface

and create a near-wall boundary layer model, which transitions to tetrahedral
cells for the remaining fluid zones. The mesh was made denser in critical areas
(e.g., areas of great curvature) to capture the characteristics of the fluid flow and
the forces acting at each point on the swimmer. The model also has articulation
points that can be placed into any position a swimmer would achieve during a
stroke cycle.
The second is an accurate description of the 3D kinematics (movement pat-
terns) of the swimmer performing the stroke (figure 7.2). The 3D kinematics were
derived through manual digitizing. Although a standard method for obtaining
kinematic data exists in swimming, limitations are present because of inherent
inaccuracies associated with this measurement technique underwater (e.g., body
shape covering visual joint location points; poor water clarity because of bubbles
and light reflection near the surface; and standard camera difficulties of paral-
lax error, distorted lenses, and setup calibration issues). Despite these potential
errors, the method allows the collection of the best possible kinematic data for
all body segments and provides a good basis for the developmental analyses of
free-swimming stroking patterns. A subjective comparison between the animated
simulation produced from the digitized data and competitive video footage taken
from various angles revealed similar movement patterns throughout the stroke.

video digitizing.
Results of the Study
This analysis provides some new insights into the freestyle swimming stroke and
the factors that affect performance. During the analysis, the pressure and viscous
drag forces acting on individual body segments were calculated at each point in
time throughout the full freestyle stroke cycle. When a force acts on a swimmer
over time, it changes the swimmer’s momentum (expressed as Newton-seconds,
or Ns). Evaluating the momentum created or removed from the swimmer within
each stroke cycle is the best way to assess technique effectiveness. Simply stated,
if a segment contributes positive momentum, the swimmer’s velocity increases.
Conversely, a negative momentum change causes the swimmer to slow down.

The momentum contributions made by various body segments and joints
over the course of a stroke cycle are presented in table 7.1. They represent the
momentum in the direction of travel. The various segments are then displayed
graphically in figure 7.3. Note that except in the first line of the table, momentum
values have been normalized by the time it takes to complete a full stroke cycle
(in this case 1.04 seconds), giving a per second value toward how each body
part influences the swimmer’s overall momentum. This normalization allows
comparisons among different athletes and swimming techniques.
Figure 7.4 displays the resultant force over the entire body throughout the
stroke cycle, and table 7.2 outlines the temporal points associated with critical
events in the stroke cycle, along with a pictorial representation of the swimmer’s
animation at this time step. The velocity of the swimmer’s hip (midiliac crest)
ranged between 1.9 and 2.3 meters per second within the stroke cycle analyzed,
and the average over this cycle was 2.08 meters per second.

The overall changes in force throughout the stroke (figure 7.4) were as expected
in that six clear cycles occurred with four small peaks and two large peaks, rep-
resenting the six-beat kick used by the swimmer. The two large peaks correlated
with the peak propulsion of the left arm just after 0.56 seconds and the right arm
at 1.07 seconds, and they occurred at the same time as two of the kicks in the
athlete’s six-beat kick cycle. The two larger propulsive peaks are validated by the
overall velocity of the swimmer’s hip. The two highest velocity peaks occurred
just after the peak propulsive forces, at 0.64 seconds and 1.14 seconds, when

the swimmer’s velocity surged to around 2.3 meters per second. The smaller
propulsive force peaks also had a small influence on the velocity.
Discussion and Application
So what does all this mean? Breaking down the distribution of forces shows
that both the arms and the legs created large amounts of propulsion, whereas
the trunk contributed most of the drag. The hands provided a total propulsive
momentum of 23.8 Ns, and the combined contribution of the wrist, forearm,
and elbow was 27.6 Ns. Hence, the forearm position during the underwater arm
stroke was as critical as that of the hands; this topic will be covered in more
depth later in the chapter. The head contributed less drag than the upper- and
lower-trunk components did, possibly because the head was usually only semi-
submerged or presented less volume, which could influence the potential level
of wave drag encountered.
Lower-Body Propulsion and Force Profiles
A longstanding topic of debate in the swimming community concerns how much
the legs and feet contribute to propulsion and whether they even contribute any-
thing more than a stabilizing balance to the freestyle stroke. But table 7.1 clearly
shows that the lower body—everything from the pelvis to the feet—contributed
more to the total momentum of front crawl swimming than the upper body did,
including the arm segments. Dissecting the data even further suggests that the
thighs, knees, and calves provided a greater percentage of the propulsion than
the feet did. These results may be misleading, however, when the mechanisms
for the net propulsive force are considered in conjunction with the effects of
the wave formation as the swimmer moves through the water. This topic will
be discussed in detail later in the chapter.
The six cycles of the six-beat kick are relatively easy to identify when looking
only at the contributions made by each leg throughout the stroke cycle (figure
7.5). Analyzing these data after correlations with the kinematics of the perfor-
mance shows that the maximum propulsive peaks started as the feet began their
respective downsweep phases.
Comparison of left- and right-leg actions shows some asymmetry in this ath-
lete. Note that this athlete had greater flexibility in the left ankle (42 degrees in
plantar flexion and dorsiflexion) compared with a 35-degree range of motion
in the right ankle. Figure 7.5 shows that better left-ankle flexibility provided
slightly more propulsion on that side (35.0 Ns) than on the right side (31.2 Ns).
Another notable difference was the variation through which the ankles
moved during the execution of the stroke (the dynamic range of motion). The
peak plantar flexion angle on some kicks varied by as much as 20 degrees. This
peak plantar flexion angle occurred when the toes were pointed to their greatest
degree, which was at the start of the feet downsweep (figure 7.6).

These intercycle variations in ankle flexibility are of interest when considering
that underwater kicking tests have demonstrated that increased ankle flexibility
can lead to an increase in propulsive force, as discussed in chapter 6, “Techniques
for Starts and Turns.” Using the left leg as an example (because of its greater
variation of maximum plantar flexion values at the start of the downsweep), it
could be expected that, during the six-beat kick, the peak left foot propulsion
would occur during kicks that demonstrated greater ankle plantar flexing values.
Conversely, kicks in which the feet did not plantar flex effectively at the start
of the downsweep could be expected to display a relative drop-off in the peak
force. But the force results here suggest that the opposite occurs because the kicks
displaying greater plantar flexion at the start of the downsweep produced lower
net propulsive force values (figure 7.7).
To understand the difference between the underwater kicking and above-
water kicking results, we need to highlight the position of the feet relative to the
water surface at the top of the downsweep during each kick. For example, the
maximum plantar flexion that occurred at the start of the downsweep during
the first kick (at 0.26 seconds) was counteracted by this foot coming out of the
water. This reduced the volume that was able to benefit from the wave water
acceleration (discussed later in the chapter). In addition, the initial acceleration
of the foot into the downsweep occurred when it was pushing against air rather
than water. Because of the differences in fluid density between air and water,
the potential propulsive force will decrease by around 800 times.

Using this theory of foot positioning in relation to water surface level, the
comparisons of leg propulsion in each cycle have greater correlations. When
comparing the foot position in figures 7.7 and 7.8, the foot was clearly out of
the water at 0.22 seconds and again at 0.92 seconds. At 0.56 seconds, the foot
was still mainly surrounded by water and the force peak was up to twice that of
the other occurrences, even though the ankle flexibility was not nearly as effec-
tive. If the feet were lower in the water for all three kicks, we would expect an
additional 60 N of propulsion to be generated for up to 0.06 seconds on each
of the two out-of-water kicks. This would enable a potential difference in a kick
cycle of 6.9 Ns per second for the left leg alone, which, at a swimming velocity

of 2.08 meters per second, could improve overall swimming speed and time by
up to 3.5 percent. This potential improvement clearly has practical significance
in competition and could influence times even further if a similar reduction in
magnitude occurs when the right leg stays in the water.
The concept of keeping the feet submerged at all times is not a common coach-
ing instruction, and, as can be seen here, it does not always occur in some elite
swimmers. But the concept is not new. Tom Jager, who held the world record
of 21.81 seconds for the 50-meter freestyle for more than 10 years, wore only a
traditional pair of Lycra briefs. One of his focus areas was ensuring that his kick
was strong and that his feet were submerged at all times (Jager 1999).
Forces Experienced by the Head and Trunk
In comparison with the legs and arms, the head and trunk segments display
little variation in drag because of the small ranges of movement of these body
parts (figure 7.9). The largest moving component in this section of the body is
the upper trunk, which also has the highest volume. Because the upper trunk
twists almost 42 degrees (body roll around the longitudinal axis) from the neu-
tral prone body position during one arm stroke cycle, it has a slight variation
in force, which makes up greater than 90 percent of the variation in the force
generated by the trunk. This results also from the differences in wetted surface
area and frontal surface area to which the upper trunk is exposed.
The upper trunk moves through a range of about 12 degrees about the trans-
verse axis (angle of the upper trunk relative to the water surface). The steepest

angles occur when the arms exit the water to commence recovery. The small
accelerations and decelerations of the trunk can create surges in the forces expe-
rienced by the body, but most of these changes are small relative to the overall
body forces experienced throughout the stroke.
Upper-Body Propulsion and Force Profiles
Reviewing the individual arm force profiles confirmed the observations detailed
in the overall drag and propulsion review. Definite peaks are associated with
the left and right arms as they move through the various phases of the stroke
cycle. (See table 7.3 for an explanation of the stroke phases and figure 7.10 for
a graphical representation of the forces generated by the right and left arms.)

Figure 7.11 outlines the breakdown of the lower-arm components for the left
arm to highlight their roles within the arm stroke force development. For both
arms, we see similar things:
• Periods of almost zero force occur for about 0.4 seconds during arm recovery.
• An initial drag on the arm occurs during the downsweep after entry, fol-
lowed by small and then large propulsive peaks.
• When examining total arm forces, the left arm peak occurs at 0.55 seconds
and the right side peaks at 1.07 seconds near the middle of the outsweeps
of the respective arm strokes.
• A secondary, lower peak occurs earlier, at 0.33 seconds for the left arm and
0.89 seconds for the right arm, which coincides with the catch positions
for the arms.
The six phases of the arm pull, along with the resulting kinetic and kinematic
observations, are discussed here in more detail. As you review the findings,
remember that the data presented here is specific to this swimmer. But the
comments and trends, along with the methods for analyzing performance, will
remain relatively consistent from swimmer to swimmer.
The first phase with the arm out in front of the head appears to create an equal
amount of drag for both arms of around −34 N to −38 N and lasts for between
0.09 and 0.11 seconds. The drag results from placing the arm into a zone of
quickly moving water (relative to the hand and arm) and, potentially, the wave
effects, which will be discussed later. The hand is the first body part to accelerate
out of this extended position when it begins to move at around 0.18 seconds.

Analyzing Strokes Using Computational Fluid Dynamics 139
The next acceleration phase occurs when the arm is pushed out laterally
from the body and we see a rapid acceleration in the hands and forearms. The
peak forces seen in this phase are between 50 N and 100 N. The forces are gov-
erned initially by the acceleration of the forearm and hand and then transition
toward being more dependent on velocity of the body segments. For the athlete
in this study, the right hand has a 15 percent greater acceleration and velocity
compared with the left side, which partially explains the slightly greater forces
generated at this time.
The third phase appears to be a transition between the outward part of the
pull, when he is using mostly the lateral muscles, and the inward sweep, when
the hand and arm move toward the midline of the body. The simulation shows
considerable deceleration by the forearm and hands at this point, which may
be one of the reasons for the drop in propulsion. The athlete may be slipping
water by moving the hand and arm too horizontally across the body and not
sufficiently along the body line (toward the feet) during this phase. The loss
in propulsion might be less than these results seem to indicate, given that the
acceleration drop seen in the simulation also occurs at a point where some of
the kinematic data reach the outer limits of accuracy (from error analysis per-
formed on the kinematic data). The second reason for the drop in propulsion
may be that the arm is moving through the trough of the generated wave at
this point (as discussed later). But the results do show that keeping this section
of the pull-through at high acceleration and high velocity along the line of the
body will help improve the overall stroke propulsion.
The fourth phase is the main power section of the stroke. Peak propulsive
forces reach between 260 N and 340 N (figure 7.10), indicative of the need
for considerable strength and power to be able to sprint effectively. The peak
forces developed in the arms are quite high; 340 N is roughly equivalent to the
strength needed to hold about 34 kilograms with an outstretched arm. Note
that this peak force does not occur at the point of either peak acceleration or
peak velocity for the hand or forearm, and it mirrors the peak hip velocity
measures of the swimmer (figure 7.12). Peak force appears to occur just after
the swimmer’s hand and forearm are close to a vertical position and pushing
directly back. It also appears to be closer to the time that the alternate hand
enters the water, leading to potential benefits from the forward motion of the
generated wave, which is discussed later.
The fifth phase occurs when the arm exits the water, the point at which drag
is suddenly created. This may be because of arm deceleration when approaching
the end of the stroke or perhaps because of some of the wave effects discussed
in the following paragraphs.
The sixth phase is the recovery, when each arm, in turn, is out of the water.
During this phase, the forces on the arms are almost zero because the low
density of air has little effect on resistive drag forces at this speed. The forces
discussed are only the fluid interaction effects on the body and do not include
acceleration of the body mass.

 Figure 7.12 Body position at the point of the peak net force during the stroke. Note
how the hands, forearms, legs, and feet are positioned to produce maximal propulsive
force.
Discussion of Full-Body Propulsion
The large propulsive arm forces recorded during phase 4 in figure 7.10 are mir-
rored in the total-body force output (see figure 7.4). Further investigation into
the mechanisms behind the development of propulsion is needed. Perhaps
peak propulsive arm force results from a relatively high velocity of the hand and
forearm at this point, as well as a high vertical angle of the hand and forearm
pushing back against the water opposite to direction of motion. But these two
factors alone do not account for the magnitude of forces registered in the analysis.
To understand other possible mechanisms for this propulsion, we need to look
at the ways that forces are generated by swimmers in the water.
Force in each direction on a body, with respect to time, is best described using
Morrison’s equation (Barltrop and Adams 1991), which combines inertial and
drag terms:

E5192/Riewald/eq01/519332/alw/r1
direction of the force, V is the object volume, and C and C are the inertial and
m d
drag coefficients, respectively.
Without delving too far into the math behind the fluid dynamics of swim-
ming, this equation has two parts: the steady-state (or velocity-dependent)
portion and the unsteady-state (acceleration-dependent) portion. The steady-
state component is related to both the velocity and the frontal surface area of
the segments. The unsteady-state component is related to the acceleration and
volume of the segments. In human swimming, the inertial forces (unsteady-
state) are often more important because of the relatively high acceleration of
the segments during the stroke compared with relatively low velocity. These
unsteady-state inertial forces are the main propulsion generators during the
arm catch, and they coincide with the start of the downsweep and upsweep of
the kick because of the high acceleration of the arm and feet segments at these
points. This highlights the importance of accelerating these segments in these
phases. The area of peak force in the mid-outsweep region of the arm stroke is
not an area of high acceleration of the arm segments, although the velocity of
these segments is high at this time. Hence, other phenomena must be at work
in creating these large forces.
A closer look at this point of the stroke suggests that the surrounding fluid flow
effects of traveling through the water may provide the answer. Part of the energy
dissipated through the water can be seen to form waves on the surface of the
water over the body. This wave has a crest forward of the head region, centered
on the hands, and forms a trough just below the hips. This wave travels along
with the swimmer and has a wavelength that is directly related to the velocity
of the swimmer (using linear wave theory) (Barltrop and Adams 1991). In this
wave that surrounds the swimmer, acceleration and velocity of the water vary
greatly and can influence the forces generated on and by the body segments.
Under linear wave theory, a swimming speed of 2.08 meters per second implies
that the wave following the swimmer travels at a similar speed as the swimmer,
with a wavelength of 2.76 meters for a wave period of 1.33 seconds. The initia-
tion of this wave starts at the point of divergence, which typically occurs close
to the most forward point of the body in the direction of travel (i.e., the hands
at the arm stroke entry back to the head when the arm is in the middle of the
pull phase). Thus, these changes in hull length affect the position of the wave
relative to the segments of the body, but not the length of the wave.
To highlight this phenomenon and show the ways in which surface waves
can affect the propulsive and drag forces experienced by a swimmer, Keys et al.
(2010) examined the changes in passive drag force across the various segments
when the swimmer is traveling in a streamlined glide position underwater and

at the water surface. Researchers have documented (Hertel 1966; Barltrop and
Adams 1991) that the differences between drag below the surface and near the
surface are caused primarily by related increases in wave drag. Previously, it
was unclear where the drag forces change on the body. Although the overall
increase in passive drag force between the submerged and near-surface trials
was 18 percent, significant differences were found between the body segments
where those changes occurred. The head and arms generated the largest increase
in drag, making a 44 percent and 50 percent increase in contribution to the
near-surface overall drag, respectively. The overall section of the body above the
waist resulted in a 121.7 percent increase in drag force, but those increases were
counteracted by the lower-body components. The thighs, knees, calves, and feet
all recorded considerable reductions in drag, and the feet changed from an area
of drag to a component that propelled the body forward. The total change for the
lower-body components was a 103.5 percent reduction in drag when compared
with the overall submerged segment results.
Variations in where the drag (negative acceleration) is concentrated from the
wave can significantly influence understanding of the way that propulsion is
generated during human swimming. The relative propulsion generated at the legs
would explain the relatively high forces recorded in those regions. Conversely,
most of the arm stroke occurs in regions of high negative acceleration, thus limit-
ing the effectiveness of generating propulsion by the arm segments for most of
the arm stroke. The exception to this would potentially be when the pulling arm
 Figure 7.13 Graphical representation of how the rapid change in initial wave
formation can potentially lead to a wave surge at the point of hand entry, allowing the
swimmer to lever off the surge to create more force.

reaches the mid-outsweep region of the stroke when the contralateral arm starts
its hand entry. The rapid change in the initial start point of the wave (moving
from the vertex of the head before hand entry to the hand at entry) likely leads
to a transient surge in the wave forward along the body as it changes to its new
starting point at hand entry. This phenomenon is presented graphically in figure
7.13. This wave surge may provide a substantial transient forward acceleration
in the form of a wall of water moving forward that the swimmer can leverage
off of, providing a significant increase in the potential to generate propulsive
force at this point. As mentioned, this potential forward surge of the wave is
transient; traditional wave formation is restored soon after hand entry. This
effect, when fully utilized, generates the greatest propulsion of any part of the
swimming stroke. Keeping the hand and arm velocity high and the forearm and
hand perpendicular to the direction of flow to ensure maximum volume and
added mass capacity at this point can potentially produce a more effective stroke.
Summary
This case study provided insight into how propulsive and drag forces are gener-
ated throughout a full freestyle swimming stroke of an elite swimmer using CFD
analysis. The resultant outcome of the analysis is greater foundational knowl-
edge related to producing propulsive and drag forces. Some practical pointers
for improving freestyle performance are listed below:
• Aim to keep the feet submerged at all times.
• Ensure that the stroke is close to symmetrical for maximum efficiency.
• Maximize the acceleration at the beginning of each arm stroke and leg kick.
• Seek the closest perpendicular angle to the direction of travel for the hands
and forearm at all times. This objective is sometimes termed getting over
the stroke.
• Prioritize keeping the vertical hand and forearm push position, especially
toward the end of the stroke, to maximize the effect from any change in
wave motion.
• Execute a rapid hand exit from the water as soon as any wave surge moves
through.
• Limit the glide time with the arm extended at the front of the stroke.

CHAPTER
Energy Systems
and Physiology
—J.M. Stager, PhD, Jonathon Stickford, PhD, and Kirk Grand
In any discussion of sport science, swimming, and performance, at some time
or another the conversation will probably take a turn to the area of exercise
physiology, energy systems, and energy metabolism. Someone will likely com-
ment, “When you get down to it, this topic is, well, pretty complicated, but really
important in terms of how swimmers train for competition.” And that statement
would be true. Given the importance that exercise physiology plays in the world
of swimming, specifically how energy is produced and used to fuel training and
performance, coaches need to have a foundational understanding of these topics.
Energy systems and overall metabolism are topics that underlie broad areas in
swimming such as fatigue and recovery, optimal race pacing, pre- and postex-
ercise nutrition, training and race recovery, overtraining, workout organization,
and possibly even talent identification. An understanding of energy systems
permeates virtually every aspect of swimming performance and preparation. The
goal of this chapter is to provide a foundational framework and understanding of
the body’s energy systems and the way in which this topic relates to optimizing
performance and preparing swimmers to perform at their best.
Several approaches can be taken when addressing the relatively broad topics
of exercise physiology and energy systems. The first approach is to review the
topic from the perspective of the metabolic pathways used to fuel athletic perfor-
mance. The second is to view the topic from the perspective of the food sources
that are ultimately metabolized to generate the metabolic energy to fuel muscle
work. Third, the topic can be viewed from the perspective of the competitive
event being performed and training characteristics needed to attain favorable
performance outcomes relative to the metabolic demands. In this chapter we
take all three approaches and attempt to review and intertwine them to provide
147

a thorough, application-based discussion of how exercise physiology and energy
systems affect training and swimming performance.
Swimmers Are Like Finely Tuned Race Cars
To begin our discussion of energy systems, we present an analogy. Let’s consider
the design and traits of various race cars and draw comparisons, albeit as imper-
fect analogs, to swimmers. The world of auto racing includes many types of race
cars, ranging from dragsters to stock cars to open-wheeled Formula One and
Indy cars. Because the events in which these race cars compete have such dif-
ferent characteristics (race length, course specifications, and so on), the vehicles
are designed to have strengths that match the demands and requirements of the
race. A dragster, for example, is designed to accelerate as quickly as possible and
can achieve straight-line speeds in excess of to 500 miles per hour (800 kph) in
around five seconds. They are not made to go around corners. But these drag-
sters have what can be described as tremendous power—an estimated 8,000 to
10,000 horsepower (6,000 to 7,500 kw) in some cases. To generate the power
required to accelerate these vehicles to their top-end speeds, dragsters must run
on a high-performance fuel mixture containing nitromethane and methanol.
This fuel source is different from what we put into an average car, but it allows
the engines to generate two to three times the power of a similar-sized engine
running strictly on gasoline. Although extremely powerful, the engine in this
type of race car can run at full throttle for only about 10 seconds, and within that
brief period it can consume as much as 20 gallons (75 liters) of fuel. In short,
the tremendous, instantaneous power accelerates these cars quickly, but it is
limited to a few seconds and comes at a tremendous cost in fuel consumption.
In direct contrast to the dragster is the Indy car. Rather than using huge
engines with enormous power output, Indy cars must be able to sustain high
speeds in excess of 200 miles per hour (320 kph) for several hours while travel-
ing race distances of 500 miles (800 km) or more. And these cars must be able
to corner quickly and frequently. The engine of an Indy car displaces less than
half of what is used in a dragster and generates much less horsepower, about 650
horsepower (500 kw) compared with 10,000 horsepower (7,500 kw). Indy cars
run on different fuels as well—ethanol and gasoline—to drive performance, and
they require better fuel economy because races may be won or lost based on the
ability of the car to conserve fuel and minimize time spent refueling during pit
stops. The contrast, then, between the dragster and the Indy car is that one is able
to generate an enormous power output that lasts for a just few seconds whereas
the other must maintain a more modest yet sustained power output that allows
the car to race for hours on end without a drop in performance.
These race cars are purposefully designed differently, and they use different
fuels based on the demands of the event in which they compete. Just like the
various types of auto-racing events, the various swimming races require swim-
mers to tap into different physiological systems to drive performance in the pool.

--- Page 160 Text ---

Energy Systems and Physiology 149
Exercise physiologists frequently use race car terminology and speak of swim-
mers as having big engines. This term is used primarily in reference to endurance
swimmers who have hearts that are able to pump large volumes of blood (car-
diac output measured in liters per minute) in a relatively short amount of time
(one minute). Because the blood carries oxygen, what really is being referenced
when describing a big engine is the ability of the heart to deliver oxygen and
other nutrients to the working muscles and the ability of the muscles to extract
those nutrients to fuel performance. This cardiac capacity generally matches the
aerobic properties of the peripheral tissues, most notably the voluntary skeletal
muscles that the swimmer uses to drive performance in the pool. As an example,
successful distance swimmers have muscles made up primarily of Type I muscle
fibers that are specifically suited to aerobic metabolism. These features are well
matched to the high aerobic capacity of the cardiorespiratory system. In terms
of comparison with the race cars discussed earlier, a distance swimmer is more
like the Indy car than the dragster, because both the swimmer and the Indy car
can sustain a moderate level of power output for a relatively long time.
On the other hand, a sprint swimmer typically has a much more modest
aerobic capacity, and although she may not be able to produce power to fuel
moderate- to long-duration activity, she is capable of generating much greater
instantaneous power for a short period, enough to finish a 50-or 100-meter race.
The sprinter’s engine has little resemblance to that of the distance swimmer.
The sprinter’s high power output is facilitated by metabolic pathways that do
not require oxygen (nonaerobic, or anaerobic), and performance is not driven
to the same extent by the ability of the heart to deliver oxygen and nutrients
to the working muscles. The absolute capacity to generate power through the
nonaerobic energy pathways is much greater than what can be produced aerobi-
cally, but similar to the dragster, the sprinter can maintain this level of power
production for only a short time. Like distance swimmers, sprint athletes also
have muscle fiber types and enzymatic profiles within the muscles that are
appropriate for supporting the high power output needed for their short-duration
events. Sprinters tend to have a greater proportion of highly fatigable fibers and
place greater reliance on metabolic pathways that use carbohydrate as the fuel
source. Successful sprint swimmers are the dragsters of the swimming world.
Overall, the swimmer’s complete underlying physiology (figure 8.1) works in
concert to affect performance in the pool.
Individuality of Training
Before going further, we should state that few swimmers fall into the classification
of being a 100 percent pure distance swimmer or a 100 percent pure sprinter. In
reality, tremendous diversity appears within the underlying inherited genetic
factors that determine performance in athletes. The examples put forward thus
far identify athletes who are the far extremes of what is a continuous spectrum
of physiologic makeups. Most swimmers fall somewhere between these two

extremes (pure sprinter and pure distance athlete), expressing some combina-
tion of dragster and Indy car traits. Every person exists somewhere along a con-
tinuum for any and all traits, including the body’s underlying physiology and
its predisposition to produce and use energy to fuel swimming performance.
Training tends to push the traits toward one end of the physiology energy system
continuum or the other, and it refines inherent, inherited talent.
With that said, we need to recognize that no singular trait alone guarantees
athletic success; athletic talent comes from having the appropriate combination
of genetic traits necessary to be successful in a sport, the mind-set to train for
that sport, and the opportunity to do so. One factor that can level the physiologic
playing field in swimming is stroke technique. An athlete’s cardiac capacity or
muscle fiber type doesn’t matter if the swimmer can’t perform the appropriate
motor skills and apply the appropriate muscular forces to the water.
For coaches, then, the key to optimizing performance in swimmers is to
maintain constant awareness of the stimuli introduced to drive adaptation (i.e.,
the training regimen and the way in which training variables are provided) and
to evaluate whether they are achieving the intended performance outcomes. An
athlete who is physiologically set up to excel as a sprinter (with the inherited
traits favoring short sprint events) can be asked to train for endurance events, and
the body will subsequently adapt metabolically to handle the imposed training
demands to the best of its ability. But although all athletes can definitely improve
their ability to endure following an endurance-focused training plan, sprinters
likely will never achieve their true athletic potential because this training does
not match the demands of sprint competition nor is it aligned with the sprinters’

true physiologic makeup. In contrast, by not aligning the focus of training with
the athlete’s physiology, the swimmer’s capacity to sprint may be compromised
in the short term, and potentially in the long term as well. The key is to use and
apply training stimuli as a means to push and develop the inherited traits of an
individual swimmer. The trick is figuring out how to do so.
Understanding the Energy Systems Used
in Swimming
In the late 1700s scientists in Europe began exploring the nature of air, noting
the remarkable similarities between what they observed in animal respiration
and how a candle flame behaved. They noted that both activities required a yet
unidentified component in the air. They postulated the existence of what we
know today to be oxygen (O). They couldn’t see it, taste it, or feel it, but they
2
concluded that oxygen must exist in the air we breathe. The French scientist
Antoine Lavoisier is credited with naming oxygen. He was the first to conclude
that mammals, including humans, consume oxygen during respiration, need
oxygen to react with organic substances in the body to produce heat and chemical
energy, and give off water and carbon dioxide as by-products of the oxygen-based
chemical reactions that occur in the body.
Lavoisier reasoned that the ”fire of life” originates from within living tissues
and can be directly related to the rate of metabolism taking place within that
tissue. For the purpose of clarity and consistency, we need to define the term
metabolism. Metabolism describes the myriad chemical reactions involved in
maintaining the health of cells, organs, tissues, and so on in the human body.
A body’s overall metabolism is determined by catabolic actions, which occur to
break down molecules and substrates for energy, and anabolic actions, which
center on the synthesis of new structures and compounds needed to sustain life
and activity. As might be expected, metabolism is closely linked to nutrition
and the availability of nutrients that serve as fuel.
Digging deeper into the area of metabolism, we also need to define the term
oxidation. Oxidation refers to a chemical reaction in which an organic compound
combines with oxygen. This chemical reaction is the process by which most cells
and tissues metabolize substrates to produce heat and useful chemical energy,
namely adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to fuel bodily functions.
More than 200 years have passed since the connection was made between
metabolism, oxidation, and the generation of heat, and it has taken the better
part of that time for scientists to describe the actual biochemical pathways
through which fuels (e.g., foods) are consumed by living tissues in the process
of generating useful biological energy. In fact, it wasn’t until the mid-1930s that
we gained a more complete understanding of the pathways that support aerobic
and anaerobic metabolism.
The first stage of energy metabolism within the muscle, particularly during
heavy exercise, often occurs through a process called glycolysis. Glycolysis is

--- Page 163 Text ---

152 Stager, Stickford, and Grand
the process by which sugars, namely glucose, are broken down within the cell
cytosol to produce useful cellular energy (ATP). Figure 8.2 illustrates the pathway
by which glucose is broken down to form two molecules of pyruvate and a net
production of two ATP molecules and two molecules of NADH, which will be
described in detail later in the chapter.
Glycolysis is the process by which sugars are metabolized as a means to provide
useful physiologic energy. Glycolysis results in the net formation of two ATP
but also yields compounds that can enter the electron transport chain (NADH)
or the citric acid cycle of aerobic metabolism (pyruvate) to produce additional
energy that can fuel muscle contraction.
Technically, glycolysis does not require the presence of oxygen nor does it
consume oxygen to produce the two molecules of pyruvate from each glucose
molecule. But the terms aerobic glycolysis and anaerobic glycolysis are often used
to refer to what comes next in the metabolic process. This next phase is largely
determined by whether glycolysis occurs in the presence or absence of oxygen,
respectively. In the presence of oxygen, pyruvate is quickly converted to acetyl-
CoA, a substrate that subsequently enters the cell mitochondria and undergoes
aerobic metabolism through the citric acid cycle. But it can also be argued that
the real key here relates to the need for energy production. When that need is

high, as it is during heavy exercise, anaerobic glycolysis is predominant. When
energy needs are low, aerobic glycolysis is the predominate pathway. As a side
note, acetyl-CoA can be formed through fatty acid oxidation as well as glycolysis.
During fatty acid metabolism, beta oxidation splits the long carbon chains found
in fat molecules into two carbon subunits, which eventually become acetyl-CoA
molecules. Therefore, at this point in the pathway the remaining reactions are
the same for the catabolism of both carbohydrate and fat. And, as an additional
note, when oxygen is present, the NADH produced through glycolysis can enter
the electron transport chain (to be described later in this section), leading to the
generation of additional ATP molecules.
When oxygen is not present in sufficient amounts (or energy demand is
exceedingly high) to support the energy needs through aerobic metabolism
alone, pyruvate is converted to lactic acid, or lactate (figure 8.3). Lactic acid,
chemically similar to lactate, is produced through a side reaction of glycolysis
that allows cellular metabolism, as well as exercise, to continue by recycling a
limited coenzyme called nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). The recy-
cling of this necessary coenzyme is required for glycolysis to continue producing
energy through the breakdown of sugars. At this point, however, the aerobic and
nonaerobic energy pathways diverge.

acid is, in fact, generated without the use of oxygen, it is being oxidized by mitochondrial
respiration within the mitochondria. If energy demands are too high to be met by
mitochondrial respiration, lactic acid can be formed to sequester the hydrogen ions.
The donor of these hydrogen ions is the glycolytic cofactor NADH. Because lactic acid

binds these hydrogens, NAD is recycled, allowing glycolysis to continue, and as such
ATP can be formed through this short pathway.

The current understanding is that glycolysis, whether it results in the forma-
tion of pyruvate or lactate, allows the generation of energy at rates that are much
greater than can be provided by aerobic metabolism alone. Glycolysis occurs
quickly, and therefore energy production is not limited solely by the capacity
of an aerobic pathway. As a result, we have to be careful that we don’t assume
that the formation of lactic acid is solely a function of the availability of oxygen.
Much has to do with demands for energy production that outpace the ability of
aerobic metabolism to provide it. More will be said later on this topic.
Aerobic Metabolism
and Swimming Performance
As mentioned, when oxygen is present the pyruvate formed as the end product
of glycolysis is converted to acetyl-CoA. Although carbohydrate metabolism or
glycolysis takes place in the skeletal muscle cell cytosol, the aerobic production
of energy occurs only within cell organelles called mitochondria; pyruvate enters
the mitochondria, where it is converted to acetyl-CoA and carbon dioxide. At
that point, the acetyl-CoA enters the Krebs cycle (named after Hans Krebs, who
first described the process) and the electron transport chain through which 32
additional ATP are ultimately produced to be used in support of biological func-
tions throughout the body, including muscle contractions. The Krebs cycle is
also known as the citric acid cycle and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. For the
purpose of this chapter, we will refer to the process by which energy is produced
aerobically as the TCA cycle.
Although it is considered part of the aerobic pathway, oxygen is not directly
used within the TCA cycle. This is because the main purpose of the TCA cycle is
to produce the hydrogen ions (H+) and electrons that will reduce the vitamin-
derived coenzymes NAD+ and FAD to form the energy-rich carriers NADH and
FADH , respectively (refer to figure 8.2). Oxygen is used only at the tail end of the
2
process, within what is known as the electron transport chain (ETC). Addition-
ally, most of the ATP that is produced is a result of the ETC. The TCA cycle and
ETC are tightly coupled within the mitochondria, and the energy associated with
the membrane-bound transport of electrons is capable of producing a number
of ATP molecules. Together, the oxidation of the coenzymes NADH and FADH
2
contributes to the bulk of the 32 ATP generated during aerobic metabolism. This
can be compared to the two, yes, two, ATP produced for each glucose molecule
during anaerobic glycolysis.
Fueling Aerobic Metabolism
In any event, the substrates required for aerobic metabolism come from the
partial breakdown of basic fuel sources such as sugars, fat, and protein, which
collectively contribute to the synthesis of ATP. The importance of sugars, as far
as performance is concerned, is that the ability to sustain exercise, whether it is

--- Page 166 Text ---
|
Energy Systems and Physiology 155
a bout of training or a competitive performance, is linked to the availability of
sugars within the active muscles. Sugars are stored as glycogen in limited quantities
intramuscularly and in larger amounts in the liver. As intramuscular glycogen is
depleted, the body draws on food consumed during activity as well as glycogen
stores in the liver to deliver glucose to the working muscles, particularly during
endurance events and prolonged practice sessions. But during heavy exercise, the
bulk of these substrates is intramuscular, not extramuscular. This circumstance
presents a problem for the athlete because the replacement of carbohydrate, either
during or after exercise, is crucial for delaying fatigue or recovering from previous
exhaustive exercise bouts.
The oxidation of one glucose molecule during anaerobic glycolysis will yield the
equivalent of seven ATP molecules, assuming that the NADH produced through
glycolysis is shuttled to the ETC. Meanwhile, the pyruvate that is formed is con-
verted to lactate, where it can be transported to the liver, heart, or neighboring
cells for use as an aerobic substrate. Again, however, if the pyruvate enters the
TCA cycle and ETC instead of being converted to lactate, 32 molecules of ATP
are produced. That additional amount of energy can be produced through the
aerobic metabolism for the same amount of glucose compared with anaerobic
glycolytic metabolism. Thus, aerobic metabolism is economical but limited in
its ability to provide power.
The energy yield from the complete oxidation of fat is much larger than that
obtained from glucose. For example, the breakdown of palmitate, a 16-carbon
fatty acid, yields 120 molecules of ATP. Part of the reason that fat provides more
energy is that it also contains more carbon atoms than carbohydrate does. The
fat molecules are simply much larger than the carbohydrate molecules because
they contain more carbon molecules, more oxygen, and more hydrogen atoms.
But even on a per carbon atom basis, fat can provide approximately 25 percent
more energy than carbohydrate does, although the reasons behind this are not
entirely understood. The energy content of one gram of fat is much greater than
the energy content of one gram of carbohydrate; fat is thus a much better com-
pound to use as an energy storage tissue.
Endurance training actually induces greater reliance on fat oxidation for a
given workload and a concomitant increase in acetyl-CoA production from beta-
oxidation and down regulation of glycolysis. In other words, after prolonged
training, a greater percentage of the energy necessary to perform a given workload
will come from fat stores as opposed to muscle carbohydrate stores. This process
spares carbohydrate within the muscles, which is often cited as a major cause of
fatigue and exhaustion.
As far as exercise is concerned, when examining the energy yield from the aero-
bic pathway, it is clear that the aerobic metabolism of a substrate is a more effec-
tive means of generating energy for sustained exercise. More sustainable energy
production translates to a larger capacity for enduring work. In other words, when
aerobic metabolism is the predominant pathway for producing energy, athletes
are capable of exercising for a much longer duration before fatigue sets in. The
caveat is that the energy is generated at a slower pace through the aerobic pathway

156 Stager, Stickford, and Grand
than through the anaerobic pathways. As the exercise intensity increases, the rate
of energy use increases and the rate of energy production must go up as well.
Intensity more than any other factor dictates the metabolic pathway neces-
sary to provide the energy to train or compete. As mentioned already, as exer-
cise intensity increases, the primary fuel sources shift from those remote to the
energy stores in skeletal muscles (the liver, for example) to the skeletal muscles
themselves. Thus, at higher exercise intensities (above approximately a 70 per-
cent effort), most energy-producing substrates (glucose, glycogen, fat, protein)
metabolized are from intramuscular sources. The issue of replacing these depleted
intramuscular fuel sources, either during or following exercise, is therefore criti-
cal. Chapter 14 delves more deeply into the needs and strategies of postexercise
nutrition as one means to replenish depleted energy stores throughout the body.
The availability of carbohydrate is especially important at these high exercise
intensities, above approximately 60 percent of a swimmer’s maximum oxygen
.
consumption (VOmax). As long as the intensity remains in the low to moderate
2
level, endurance exercise can be sustained for two hours or longer before muscle
glycogen stores become depleted. Above this threshold, however, intramuscu-
lar energy stores are depleted at a much faster rate. People who deplete muscle
carbohydrate stores, and subsequently have lower than desired concentrations
of sugar in the blood, are likely to experience the onset of fatigue. A two-hour
swim workout will undoubtedly have an effect on muscle carbohydrate stores.
Carbohydrate depletion can have a dramatic effect on the ability of a swimmer
to complete a two-hour workout and any subsequent workouts. The depletion
of muscle carbohydrate stores will cause a shift to fat oxidation as the primary
means of energy production. Fat oxidation is associated with lower rates of
mitochondrial respiration and therefore reduced power output.
Energy availability and training design go hand in hand. A common practice is
to plan sprint sets toward the end of a practice session, presumably to challenge
the fast-twitch fibers when carbohydrate stores in the active fibers are nearly
depleted. Athletes with a preponderance of fast-twitch fibers (i.e., sprinters) may be
observed to have difficulty sustaining their efforts through an exhaustive practice
and be unable to maximize their sprint performance at the end of a training ses-
sion, regardless of their motivation to do so. When metabolic limits are reached,
motivation can do little to overcome substrate exhaustion. The swimmer needs to
recover and eat plenty of carbohydrate to recharge and replenish the fuel sources.
Coming back to fueling and supplying the body with the nutrients needed
to produce energy, unfortunately, coaches can do only so much to influence the
macronutrient quality of their swimmers’ diets. Swimmers need to recognize
that this aspect of performance is under their control. Because the fuel source for
glycolysis is largely derived from intracellular glucose and glycogen stores, these
stores must be replenished consistently as part of a recovery protocol. Athletes’
diets, in general, should contain 70 percent carbohydrate. Between 1 and 1.5
grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight should be consumed in the
first 45 to 60 minutes following exhaustive exercise. Data now support the use of

--- Page 168 Text ---

common foodstuffs such as flavored milk (chocolate milk) as a means of meet-
ing those recommendations (Stager et al. 2014). The point to stress to swimmers
who are training twice a day is that how they approach recovery nutrition can
either limit or ensure success of the second daily practice. Swimmers and their
parents need to use this information to the athletes’ advantage.
·
VO max Testing to Evaluate Aerobic Capacity
2
The body’s maximal ability to take up, transport, and use oxygen is referred to
. .
as maximal oxygen consumption, or VOmax. VOmax is typically measured in
2 2
absolute terms (e.g., liters of oxygen consumed per minute) or normalized to
the athlete’s size and expressed in milliliters of oxygen consumed per kilogram
of body mass per minute (ml ∙ kg−1 ∙ min−1). Because the consumption of oxygen
is linked to the production of energy, and energy is necessary to perform the
.
muscular contractions during exercise, VOmax is an indication of the body’s
2 .
upper limit to perform aerobic work. For this reason, VOmax is considered an
2
important determinant of endurance performance. Coaches frequently target a
.
swimmer’s VOmax as a variable that they specifically want to change and improve
2 .
by prescribing extended, high-yardage aerobic sets in training. But VOmax should
2
not be viewed as the equivalent to athletic performance; an athlete who has a
.
high VOmax is not guaranteed athletic success, even in endurance events. An
2 .
important point to recognize is that the measurement of VOmax estimates only
2
the capacity to generate energy aerobically and does not provide information
about the capacity of nonaerobic metabolism.
.
The extremely high VOmax values seen in some of the top distance athletes
2
across sports are likely driven by genetics, and many researchers postulate that
aerobic capacity is more an inherited trait than it is a performance factor that
can be extensively modified through an intensive training program (Stager and
Tanner 2005). Interestingly, mitochondria have been shown to have their own
DNA, and most of a person’s mitochondrial material and subsequent ability to
produce energy aerobically is believed to be inherited from the mother (Brooks,
.
Fahey, and Baldwin 2004). With that said, aerobic capacity and VOmax are real-
2
istically affected by both genetics and training to differing degrees. The point
.
here is that not every athlete has the capability to develop a high VOmax even if
2
the training is developed to maximize this performance variable. Expectations
are that successful middle- to long-distance swimmers (events of 800 meters and
.
longer) will have relatively high VOmax values and sprinters will have lower
2
values, providing an optimal match between cardiovascular supply, peripheral
demand, and race demands.
.
The testing or measurement of VOmax is one of the oldest and most common
2
laboratory procedures conducted in the field of exercise physiology. Beginning
with the work of A.V. Hill at the Harvard Fatigue Laboratory in the early 1920s,
exhaled gas was collected in large bags while athletes exercised. The gas com-
position was subsequently analyzed. The entire process took days to complete
because all analyses were performed by hand. Today, graded exercise tests on a

--- Page 169 Text ---

treadmill, swim flume, or cycle ergometer are the most common tests performed
.
to evaluate VOmax. Researchers have instantly responding gas analyzers con-
2
nected to computers that provide results immediately. The protocol used to
.
quantify VOmax is commonly referred to as a max test. The test usually has the
2
athlete running on a treadmill, cycling on an ergometer, or swimming in a flume
at progressively faster paces until he cannot continue the test. The measurement
.
of VO is made using a technique referred to as indirect calorimetry. The process
2
requires an oxygen analyzer, a carbon dioxide (CO ) analyzer, and a way to
. 2
measure ventilatory volumes. VOmax values for mature adults range from 1 to
2
5 liters of oxygen per minute, in absolute terms. If these values are normalized
with respect to body weight, values occur in the range of 20 to nearly 90 ml ∙
kg−1 ∙ min−1. This normalization is done so that people can be compared despite
being different in sizes and shape, age, gender, and so on. The low values (20
to 40 ml ∙ kg−1 ∙ min−1) typically belong to sedentary and physically inactive
people. The high values in the 60 to 90 ml ∙ kg−1 ∙ min−1 range are often observed
in elite athletes or other well-trained people.
.
Far fewer VOmax data values are available in the literature for swimmers as
2
compared with athletes in other sports largely because of the scarcity of flumes
in which to test swimmers. The data that are available, however, show that
successful swimmers score relatively high (50 to 75 ml ∙ kg−1 ∙ min−1) in terms
.
of VOmax but not as high as cross-country skiers (high 80s to low 90s ml ∙
2
kg−1 ∙ min−1) or mid- to long-distance cyclists and runners (mid 80s ml ∙ kg−1 ∙
min−1) (Capelli, Pendergast, and Termin 1998). Ventilatory threshold (the point
at which ventilation increases disproportionately with an increase in exercise
intensity), heart rate threshold, and the onset of blood lactate accumulation
.
can typically be measured at the same time as VOmax is measured. All three
2
of these indices provide an estimate of the sustainable workload that an athlete
can endure. The goal for the coach is to train the athlete so that the threshold
.
occurs at a higher percentage of VOmax. A measure of training success is repre-
2
sented by a shift toward a higher threshold (percentage), regardless of the index
measured. The current perception is that some of these alternate measures are
.
better predictors of the sustainable power output than VOmax (Di Prampero et
2
al. 1974; Ivy et al. 1981; Olbrecht 2000). Even the ability to achieve and sustain
.
a higher percentage of VOmax during training may be more important that the
. 2
value of VOmax per se.

Anaerobic Energy Pathways
and Swimming Performance
Anaerobic metabolism becomes the predominant energy pathway if the amount
of muscular work is such that the energy requirements are greater than what can
be supplied aerobically. Two anaerobic pathways assist in energy production.
The first of these, glycolysis, has already been introduced. Recall that glycoly-
sis can occur in the absence of oxygen, producing two ATP as glucose broken

down into lactic acid and lactate. Although lactic acid is sometimes thought of
as a waste product of metabolism, it can be argued that lactic acid production
actually allows an increased capacity to do work. As it turns out, although some
cells produce lactic acid at a rapid rate, other cells use it as a convenient and even
preferential fuel source. The point is that without the ability to produce lactic
acid, exercise capacity becomes compromised.
Anaerobic glycolysis is an effective means of energy production only during
short, intense exercise; it can provide energy for 10 seconds to 2 minutes. Glycoly-
sis produces ATP about 100 times faster than aerobic metabolism does. As such,
anaerobic glycolysis is the dominant energy-producing system for maximum-
effort activities performed within this time range. Because the formation of lactic
acid reduces the concentration of pyruvate in the muscle, the rate of glycolysis
increases (a high pyruvate concentration in muscle slows glycolysis) and provides
additional NAD+, which allows glycolysis to continue. Finally, some evidence
indicates that lactic acid can move intracellularly into the mitochondria and be
consumed through aerobic pathways as oxygen becomes available (Brooks and
Gaesser 1980; Booth and Baldwin 1996; Brooks et al., 2004). Lactic acid easily
dissociates in the body to form hydrogen ions and lactate, which can enter the
bloodstream and be measured there using a simple blood test. The rate of lactate
removal from the blood following an intense effort is commonly used as an
index of recovery status and training state.
Note, however, that carbohydrate can be consumed aerobically. If the environ-
ment and energy balance in the cell is such that pyruvate can be oxidized by the
mitochondria, little lactic acid will be produced and the available carbohydrate
will be used in this manner. Insulin, the hormone produced by the pancreas,
stimulates the use of glucose as a fuel source such that consuming a substance
high in sugar will stimulate carbohydrate metabolism regardless of the oxygen
availability or workload of the muscle. And when carbohydrate metabolism
goes up, there is generally an increase in lactate production met by an increase
in lactate consumption. Blood levels of lactate thus don’t change (figure 8.4).
From a practical perspective, though, it has been observed that the point at
which lactate begins to accumulate in the blood (onset of blood lactate accumu-
lation, or OBLA) can be a useful marker of exercise intensity and can be used
to monitor training adaptations. The OBLA represents the exercise intensity at
which the lactate clearance mechanisms are outpaced by the rate at which lactic
acid is being produced. Typically, this point occurs at a blood lactate concentra-
tion of around four millimoles, which is purported to be the optimal training
level or intensity for building aerobic capacity. Nevertheless, a work rate at or
below OBLA is thought to reflect a training intensity that an athlete can sustain
for prolonged periods.
A few swim programs have the equipment, personnel, and ability to plot the
relationship between swimming speed and blood lactate for each athlete. The
purpose of this test is to obtain an objective measure of conditioning and prog-
ress through the season or training cycle. To determine the OBLA, a swimmer
performs a series of swims, usually a set of 200s, and gets adequate rest between

efforts. For a two-swim test, the first 200 is typically swum at a submaximal
speed and the second is swum all out. If more intervals are used, each swim is
performed at a successively higher intensity, or at a faster pace, than the previ-
ous one until the swimmer is giving 100 percent effort on the final swim. After
each swim, a small sample of blood is taken, typically from the ear lobe, and
evaluated using a measurement device to determine blood lactate concentra-
tion. When a plot is generated with the swim speed on the x-axis and lactate
concentration on the y-axis, a coach or scientist can draw inferences about the
swimmer’s anaerobic and aerobic capacities.
Repeated assessments of the OBLA, done over time, can assist in evaluating the
success, or lack thereof, of a seasonal training schedule. Over time, a swimmer
who is responding positively to the training plan would be expected to show a
shift in the OBLA to higher intensities, or faster swimming paces (figure 8.5).
In practical terms, the swimmer would be able to swim at a faster speed before
lactic acid production outpaces the ability of the working muscles to remove it.
The best description of the complexity and caveats of this assessment can be
found in Olbrecht’s book The Science of Winning (2000). Needless to say, this
type of testing is beyond all but a few national programs or dedicated research
laboratories.
Before leaving this topic, we need to discuss the fate of lactate after it is pro-
duced. Most of the lactic acid or lactate is ultimately metabolized through the
TCA cycle, in part during exercise and in part during recovery following exer-
cise. The rate of lactate clearance can be increased following a bout of exercise

Swim velocity can be substituted for power and, from this, appropriate training speeds
can be estimated. With this information and with heart rate as an additional measure,
training bouts can be designed within the training zones that range from recovery to
anaerobic, or all-out, efforts. The onset of blood lactic acid (OBLA), as well as peak lactic
and the lactic acid threshold, can be estimated from this challenge. OBLA is considered
one of the critical training intensities for optimal results. As training progresses, the
expectation is that the blood lactate curve will shift relative to workload and that OBLA
will occur at a higher swim speed.

by performing an active cool-down for a prescribed length of time. The aerobic
metabolism during the cool-down facilitates the removal of blood lactate by
using it as an aerobic fuel source. Ironically, the shorter the race is, and thus the
higher the postexercise lactate blood levels are, the longer the active recovery
needs to be. Conversely, the longer the race is and the more aerobically based
the exercise bout is, the shorter the active recovery needs to be to clear the lac-
tate from the system. Endurance athletes have a greater capacity to clear lactate
and a smaller capacity to generate it. Generally, sprinters don’t like to hear that
they need a 10- to 15-minute cool-down following a 20-second, 50-meter free,
but they do. Thus, sprinters need more active cool-down time and endurance
athletes much less. Unfortunately, swimmers rarely cool down enough follow-
ing practice. Distance swimmers may be inclined to recover adequately, but
sprinters may be more inclined to cool down for less time than they need. The
time needed for postevent recovery depends on the specific traits and training
status of each swimmer. Research shows that at least 10 minutes of moderate
exercise is necessary to begin clearing the lactate that accumulates in the body
after strenuous exercise (Brooks and Gaesser 1980; Olbrecht 2000).
Phosphogens and Anaerobic Metabolism
The second anaerobic, or nonaerobic, energy pathway involves certain chemical
substances found within the cells. The phosphogens—ATP (adenosine triphos-
phate), ADP (adenosine diphosphate), and PCr (creatine phosphate)—are found
within the cytosol of the muscle cells and provide an even more immediate
physiological energy source that allows muscular work to begin before engaging
either anaerobic glycolysis or the aerobic metabolic pathways (figure 8.6). These
high-energy compounds provide energy almost instantaneously, but the energy
stores become exhausted after several seconds. The instantaneous power output
of these immediately available high-energy compounds greatly exceeds the

--- Page 173 Text ---
}
162 Stager, Stickford, and Grand
capacity of the aerobic system to generate energy. Sprinters use this immediate
energy to fuel their big engines (in this case, the muscular engine rather than
the cardiovascular engine) during short sprints.
In his book The Science of Winning, Olbrecht (2000) likens this immediate
energy system to an electrical battery. The energy can be supplied nearly instan-
taneously, but the battery discharges at a rapid rate. The more energy that is
needed, the faster the battery discharges. Some limited evidence suggests that
athletes can alter this discharge rate through training or through nutritional
supplements (Booth and Baldwin 1996). Only very small improvements in the
energy delivery from this immediate pathway should be expected over the course
of a training season, so in many ways this energy system remains constant.
The holy grail that many coaches try to achieve with their athletes repre-
sents somewhat of an oxymoron—sprint-specific endurance, or the ability to
perform high-intensity efforts repeatedly. Trainability in this pathway appears
to be limited, so sprinters and their coaches need to focus on other limitations
as a means of getting faster in the pool. Controversy has continued over the
years about whether nutritional supplements such as creatine can improve
nonaerobic energy metabolism. The answer appears to be yes—supplementation
can improve nonaerobic energy production at least for the glycolytic pathway,
although not by nutritional supplements but through carbohydrate intake. As
for increasing the available pool of phosphogens, no consensus exists about
whether it is possible to boost the production of this energy pathway (Brooks,
Fahey, and Baldwin 2004).
As another comment on anaerobic development, one common observation is
that most outstanding swimmers begin formal training early and rarely achieve
great success until they reach adult stature. This drawn-out progress may be

because of an inherent biological clock that prevents young swimmers from
responding to some training stimuli until after adolescence. Although young
swimmers can improve cardiopulmonary performance, they don’t seem to be
able to increase muscular power output to any great extent. Those improve-
ments that do occur are probably a result of changes that take place in the cen-
tral nervous system. Therefore, coaches must provide training that is age and
developmentally appropriate. Pre- and periadolescent swimmers may not be
able to respond to the training regimes used by college athletes, particularly as
it applies to anaerobic development.
Anaerobic Testing
Estimating power output and anaerobic capacity of swimmers has proved to be
a difficult task; no definitive markers or tests can be employed to quantify the
capacity of nonaerobic pathways or an athlete’s nonaerobic conditioning. Thus,
most tests used to assess anaerobic capacity are performance tests during which
athletes are asked to perform a task. Results are then compared with those of
other athletes as well as past performances. The Wingate cycle ergometer anaero-
bic test is an example of this type of evaluation. The standing vertical jump test
could also be described in this way. Researchers have also used modified swim
benches to quantify the work capacity or power outputs of swimmers. A few
have used in-water tests (e.g., tethered and semitethered swimming, or evalu-
ation of force production against submerged force plates) to assess the power
output of swimmers with varying success. The bottom line is that, in contrast to
measures of aerobic capacity, the quantification of anaerobic capacity is much
less routine. Currently, there is no convenient means of measuring the quantity
of ATP or PCr used during a swim bout or the rate at which energy is produced
nonaerobically. Coaches and scientists rely on algorithms composed primarily
of performance measures as a means of comparing athletes with each other and
with themselves at different times during the training regime.
Physiological Tie-Ins to Technique
One of the basic tenets of swim coaching has always been that technique trumps
training. This principle is borne out not just through biomechanical analyses but
also in discussions about physiology and energy systems. Improving a swimmer’s
ability to develop and apply forces can have a tremendous effect on how the
body’s energy systems are used to fuel performance. Efficiency is key because
the relationship between the resistive forces in swimming and the metabolic
costs to generate propulsion is not linear. In other words, as the swim speed
increases, the metabolic costs increase at a faster rate, primarily because the
resistive forces increase disproportionately to swim speed (resistance increases
proportionally to swim velocity raised to the second power). The biomechanical
reasons underlying this relationship are described in greater detail in chapter
1. Swim training is not often partitioned into two components, training and

practice, but we might argue that training is directed at the cardiopulmonary
aspects of performance and practice is focused on the technical and tactical
aspects. The coaching emphasis is often placed on training, and much less time
is spent on practice, but both should have a time and place in a well-designed
periodized training plan.
Anaerobic and Aerobic Contributions
to Performance
One aspect of metabolism worth mentioning at this point is the fact that the
nonaerobic and aerobic pathways can be active simultaneously; they do not
operate independently. Total metabolism represents the combination of aerobic
and nonaerobic metabolism, and all these elements should be evaluated when
structuring training for a swimmer. Coaches need to recognize that training
only aerobically might be of limited benefit to some athletes and perhaps even
detrimental to others, and vice versa. The role of coaches is to balance and focus
the training to match the unique physical and physiological attributes of the
athletes they work with.
Aerobic power output is often high when aerobic metabolism is high. As
exercise intensity increases during a progressive workload, the aerobic contribu-
tion increases until it plateaus. At the same time, as the workload continues to
increase, the nonaerobic contribution to the overall power output increases as
well; at very high workloads, the power output of both the aerobic and nonaerobic
energy systems may be near maximal. Going back to the analogy that equates
swimmers to race cars, automobile manufacturers have figured out how to turn
on and turn off engine cylinders depending on the need for additional power.
Thus, when a driver is accelerating, the car uses all available cylinders to produce
the necessary power. After cruising speed is achieved, however, the engine runs
on fewer cylinders to improve fuel economy. Using all cylinders generates plenty
of horsepower, but fuel economy suffers. Physiologically, though, the ability to
sustain high power outputs is similarly limited because the fuel that supports
anaerobic metabolism runs out relatively quickly. Athletes find it difficult to
sustain maximum effort for even a minute because of this limited nonaero-
bic power output. Unfortunately, the only way to reduce power output while
swimming a race is to slow down and turn off the cylinders. We might wonder,
however, whether the limited kicking that some swimmers do during endur-
ance events might be a way of turning off a few cylinders rather than reducing
arm turnover or pace.
Finally, the fact that oxygen is not necessarily absent during nonaerobic
metabolism needs to be underscored. For this reason, physiologists are begin-
ning to favor the use of the term nonaerobic or nonrobic rather than anaerobic.
Too often people assume that anaerobic metabolism occurs only when there
is a lack of oxygen. A more accurate conception is to think of the causal factor
as being a greater need for energy production than what can be met by aerobic

metabolism alone. For example, at the beginning of a race, some time passes
before aerobic metabolism ramps up. Research suggests that a minute and a half
or two minutes might elapse before a swimmer’s aerobic metabolism reaches a
steady state (Di Prampero et al. 1974; Capelli, Pendergast, and Termin 1998).
But the energy needs of the body during the race must be met if the required
amount of muscular work is to take place. The only way to cover this energy
deficit is through nonaerobic sources, so they will stay active at a high level
until such a time that aerobic metabolism can meet the energetic needs of the
working muscles.
At the onset of exercise, or following an increase in exercise intensity, the
main sources of ATP generation are through preexisting ATP and PCr stores in
the muscle along with glycolysis. Almost instantaneously, these systems quickly
begin to contribute energy and ATP. Then, glycolysis represents the primary
energy pathway. After roughly 30 to 90 seconds (90 to 120 seconds for a plateau)
steady-state exercise is attained, and only then does aerobic metabolism become
the predominant means of ATP synthesis. As indicated, the sustainable energy
provided through aerobic metabolism is much greater than that provided through
nonaerobic sources even though the instantaneous power output is much higher
with nonaerobic metabolism. The problem is that muscles don’t know before-
hand that they will be doing physical work, let alone at what intensity. Thus,
some time is needed to ramp up aerobic metabolism. This requirement might
explain the metabolic value of a prerace warm-up. In some ways the warm-up can
be thought of as an energy conservation process. By shutting down the system
until needed, the necessary substrate usage (to sustain basic metabolism) drops
to nearly nothing. After swimmers start training and are using large amounts
of energy during practice, they need foodstuffs to supply the raw materials for
the pathways. By warming up before an intensive exercise bout, the transition
from immediate and available metabolism to sustainable aerobic metabolism
takes place more quickly.
Training Effects and Their Effect
on Performance
Different types of training induce different physical and physiological adapta-
tions, so the training that swimmers engage in should be matched as well as
possible to their physiology and the events in which they compete. The state-
ment that James “Doc” Counsilman made famous a half-century ago remains
true today: “You have to learn to treat your swimmers equally, but train them
individually.”
Sprint training and endurance training result in different physiologic adap-
tations, some of which are conflicting. Coaches have observed for years that
endurance training can interfere with a swimmer’s ability to develop the power
needed to sustain sprint performance. Nevertheless, many coaches still attempt
to improve a sprinter’s ability to maintain speed by prescribing prolonged

endurance sets. This approach may improve a swimmer’s ability to recover, but
it is not optimal for enhancing performance in the water. High-intensity exercise
bouts of short duration and in surprisingly limited total weekly accumulation
(6 to 12 minutes a week) have been shown to stimulate increases in glycolytic
and mitochondrial enzymes within the muscle groups trained (Costill, Fink,
and Pollock 1976; Booth and Baldwin 1996). Other research has shown that
swim training limited to little more than swimming 1,000 meters a day (with
most of the remaining physical training taking place on dry land) can result in
gains in sprint performance (Hickson 1980; Stager and Tanner 2005). Although
this recommendation does not apply across the board, it does demonstrate that
continued evaluation of necessary training loads and optimal training distances
is warranted.
For the sprinter, research suggests that power output in the water is the most
critical component of performance. Of course, this statement assumes that stroke
mechanics are not otherwise a limiting factor. Aerobic capacity may play a role
in the sprinter’s ability to recover quickly and endure a workout, but it plays
just a small role in actual race performance. Coaches are cautioned to consider
that the goal of optimal training should be to perform a specific event (or event
distance), not simply to make it through a demanding workout of many thou-
sands of meters a week.

swimmer always has a high peak but fatigues rapidly and more than the distance
swimmer does, regardless of the training. The opposite is true for the distance swimmer,
yet the area under the curve is greater for the distance swimmer. Appropriate training
appears to decrease the time from the onset of the exercise to peak power, but it does
not necessarily decrease the rate of fatigue. Nevertheless, both swimmers increase their
instantaneous power output at every point along the 30-second challenge.

amount of power that can be produced during this particular movement,
improves, and the total power output represented by the shaded area under the
curve improves with continual training. Also, the time to peak power may be
shortened, which is an advantage in short swim events. But the slope of the line
that reflects the ability to endure does not appear to change much over time,
partly because the test lasts only 30 seconds. Nevertheless, at the end of the
season the swimmers appear to fatigue at rates similar to the rates that occur
preseason. The improvement in performance appears to be greater power output
at each instance (allowing for greater speed), fatigue occurring at about the same
rate, and earlier peak power. Not enough is known about this aspect of training
to be able to provide an adequate explanation for these findings.
The reality is that all swimmers need some aerobic and some sprint, or power-
focused, training. Finding the proper balance and designing the training plan
to optimize an athlete’s physiologic development is the key to maximizing in-
water performance. This topic is part of planning and periodization, discussed
in chapter 9.
Another factor to consider when incorporating physiological adaptation into
a training program design is that although endurance training has been shown
to result in an increase in mitochondrial mass, is does not necessarily result in
an increase in mitochondrial activity or overall contractile fiber volume. In fact,
physiologists have identified a simultaneous decrease in contractile myofibrils
because of prolonged overdistance training. Overdistance training increases
delivery of oxygen by decreasing the diffusion distance between the capillary
and mitochondria, in part by increasing capillary density. But this effect can also
be achieved by reducing the mass of the muscle contractile apparatus (i.e., the
cross-sectional area of the muscle), which is good for gas diffusion but bad for
force generation. This outcome would be positive for events primarily dependent
on oxygen delivery but negative for athletic events in which muscle power or
force drives performance.
A tendency in modern competitive swim training, one that is deeply rooted in
the culture of swimming in the United States, is for coaches to focus on aerobic
training almost exclusively as they develop an ability within their swimmers to
endure and persevere through excessive yardage to achieve success in the pool.
This statement is not meant to describe all swim programs, but many competi-
tive swim programs preferentially emphasize aerobic training for all athletes.
The dilemma of this type of training is that overdistance training pushes the
metabolic framework of the athlete toward the aerobic end of the spectrum and
can hamper the power development and power output of the athlete. Coaches
need to consider the full spectrum of physiological makeups that swimmers
might possess and structure the training for the sprint group to focus on power
and speed, not necessarily the development of the aerobic system.
.
Additionally, with endurance training only slight improvements in VOmax

may be observed, even with a greater than twofold increase in the amount of
mitochondrial enzymes within the muscles. Although the increase in muscle
mitochondria may allow a slightly greater extraction of oxygen from the blood

by the working muscles, this rise contributes to only a minor increase in VOmax.

training (figure 8.8). Like it or not, the very high values for VOmax observed in
2
successful endurance performers are greatly influenced by inherited factors.
We reiterate that athletic success is multifactorial and a combination of talent
and training.
Still, the overall number and size of the muscle mitochondria increase with
appropriate training. In addition, the enzyme activities involved in the TCA cycle,
ETC, and beta-oxidation increase as a result of endurance training. The training
adaptations carry the potential to increase the rate of oxidative phosphorylation
within the muscle. As a result, endurance-trained muscles are able to oxidize fat
at a higher rate than untrained muscles can. In other words, a larger proportion
of the energy produced to fulfill the exercise demand will come from fat and
less from carbohydrate (i.e., glycogen is spared). Because of less carbohydrate
utilization, less lactate is produced for a given submaximal workload, and fat
is increasingly used as a fuel source. Collectively, the adaptations result in less
dependency on carbohydrate during exercise and prolonged endurance.

Immediate energy is available for intense, short bursts of muscular power, whereas
aerobic metabolism is almost unlimited in terms of maintenance. Most exercise, and
certainly nearly all swim training, relies on all three pathways.

Energy Systems and Physiology 169
Summary
Energy systems are at the center of everything that athletes hope to accomplish
in the pool. The ability to metabolize food or fuel rapidly is essential in terms
of providing the active tissues with the energy necessary to generate muscular
force and drive performance in the pool or the weight room. The rate at which
usable energy can be provided to the working muscle is key to athletic success,
assuming that everything else (nutrition, training, mechanics, psychology, and
so forth) is already optimal. For the sprinter, it’s about tapping into immediate
energy sources to fuel performance. For the endurance swimmer, it really isn’t
about how much energy is available before the race; rather, it’s about how fast
energy can be generated during the race that truly matters. Energy availability
before and during a prolonged practice is potentially an important performance-
limiting factor.
To do physiological or mechanical work, muscle cells need energy. The energy
needed to fuel swimming performance comes from three energy pathways—the
immediate anaerobic phosphate-based energy system, glycolysis, and aerobic
metabolism. The substrates used to provide the energy to do work are carbohy-
drate, fat, and protein. These nutrients are broken down to provide the substrates
needed for the metabolic energy pathways.
Endurance performance largely depends on aerobic metabolism and cardio-
pulmonary conditioning (heart, lungs, and mitochondria). In contrast, sprint
performance relies on muscular power and the nonaerobic production of intra-
cellular energy sources (phosphogens and sugars). During workouts and many
competitive events, all three energy systems are important. Coaches need to
consider the underlying physiology of each athlete and design a training program
that targets those features and optimizes performance results. Coaches, athletes,
and parents should recognize additional performance-affecting information in
the area of exercise physiology and energy systems.
Skeletal muscles can be loosely described as having two opposing traits:
the ability to endure and the ability to generate high levels of force and power.
Coaches need to be cognizant of the dichotomy that exists in the metabolic and
muscular adaptations to swim training. Some swimmers are born dragsters,
and others are Indy cars, but both need to be trained appropriately. From the
perspective of metabolism and energetics, the coaching adage about the neces-
sity of training being specific to the targeted event is as true today as it was 100
years ago.
Endurance can be enhanced by inducing metabolic (peripheral) and cardio-
pulmonary (central) adaptations to physical training. A robust cardiopulmonary
system, one that ensures delivery of oxygen to the peripheral active tissues, is an
important partner in the metabolic ability to endure. The heart and lungs must
be evenly matched and capable of meeting the stress and muscular metabolic
demands of intense exercise. Capillary density within the active muscles must
be sufficient to provide for tissue gas exchange and nutrient delivery. Ventilatory

muscles must be able to move air into the lungs for extended periods. Hemo-
globin must be adequate to carry oxygen to the periphery with each heartbeat.
These morphological adaptations to exercise and physical training do not occur
quickly and may take many months, if not years, to be fully expressed.
As for sprinting, research has shown that increases in intramuscular phos-
phogens are hard to accomplish through training. Little research supports the
use of supplements such as creatine as a means of improving competitive race
performance. Metabolic and enzyme adaptations that are observed in response
to sprint training are much more modest than what has been shown to occur
in the mitochondrial enzymes as a result of endurance training. An increase
in aerobic capacity may improve a swimmer’s ability to tolerate training and
improve recovery rates, but it does little to improve sprint performance per se.
Endurance is likely a trait more easily developed than are the traits necessary
for success in the shortest sprints.
Although carbohydrate stores have been shown to increase in the trained
person, this expansion has a greater effect on the ability to endure workouts
than the ability to generate instantaneous muscular power during a race. Much
of the improvement in muscle power resulting from sprint training comes from
neurological changes that favor recruitment of muscle fibers and increased
muscle cross-sectional area.
Increasing the training load as a means of improving the endurance of a
sprinter will likely interfere with the sprinter’s ability to sprint rather than
improve sprint times. Research suggests that muscle fibers contract faster after
prolonged rest rather than after prolonged use. This is not to say that less train-
ing results in better performance. The point is that overdistance training for the
sprinter may not improve sprinting successes.
The type of training that induces metabolic changes consistent with endur-
ance is not the same as the training that affects muscular power. And research
has shown that it is difficult, if not impossible, to improve metabolic endurance
and muscular power simultaneously. We now believe that specific metabolic
adaptations occur during one phase of training and specific power adaptations
occur at another. This consideration should be designed into both the annual
plan and the larger plan for the career of a young swimmer. The nature and
characteristics of the training regime must be appropriately designed chrono-
logically to stimulate the appropriate metabolic and muscular adaptations that
will eventually favor success.
.
Testing, whether it is VOmax testing to evaluate aerobic performance or
2
Wingate testing to examine anaerobic capacity, should have a consistent place
in a training plan.
Coaches and athletes should be aware of the importance of postrace or post-
training recovery and take active steps to refuel the body with the intent of
replenishing energy stores.
Coaches should design periodized plans to assist in the strategic develop-
ment of physical and physiologic capacities over the short term and throughout
a swimmer’s career.

Energy Systems and Physiology 171
Overall, an understanding of exercise physiology, energy systems and ways
to train them, and the individuality of each athlete will help coaches lead their
swimmers to better performances in the pool. Coaches need to develop different
training plans for sprinters and endurance athletes, offer different sets within
each practice, and emphasize different aspects throughout the swim season. All
coaches are encouraged to strive toward this goal. If they are able to achieve it,
great things will happen with the swimmers they work with.

CHAPTER
Periodization
and Planning
—Scott Riewald, PhD, CSCS
Throughout this book a great deal of application-focused information has been
presented about how to improve the performance of swimmers. Although
all the pieces of information are beneficial on their own, they can be merged to
develop a focused, age-appropriate training program that will enhance perfor-
mance as well as protect the health of the athlete.
This chapter addresses the concepts of planning and periodization. Although
these terms are sometimes thought of as synonymous, they take on different
meanings when it comes to training design. Planning incorporates elements
of structure—establishing both short- and long-term training goals as well as
defining the path to take to achieve those goals. Periodization, on the other
hand, focuses on the methodology underlying the plan—the cyclical, or peri-
odic, nature of manipulating training variables, including rest, to optimize
performance outcomes. Proper planning and periodization are critical elements
of training design; they work hand in hand. Understanding both planning and
periodization will help coaches develop programs that will allow swimmers to
do the following:
• Set and achieve realistic performance goals within a season as well as across
longer, even multiyear, time horizons
• Achieve peak performances at specific competitions during the season
• Provide variety to a training plan to increase enjoyment while helping to
prevent performance plateaus
• Engage in age-appropriate and developmentally appropriate training
through all stages of development, shifting the goals and training foci as a
swimmer progresses from an age-group swimmer to a senior swimmer and
potentially on to the collegiate and national levels

• Achieve their true performance potential, not necessarily when they are 10,
12, or 14 years old, but when they are physically mature and can take full
advantage of the strength, physiologic development, and technique that
have built up as the body has matured
• Maintain health, as well as performance, while avoiding burnout and
overtraining
In this chapter we look at how training can be structured to optimize perfor-
mance while also discussing how the sport sciences collectively can be used to
help a coach build daily, monthly, seasonal, and even quadrennial performance
training plans. Where possible, the chapter draws from other sport science disci-
plines to create a thread that weaves throughout the book and pulls the material
together in a coherent way.
Planning for Performance
A number of basic training principles underlie program design. Yet when it
comes down to it, the most important thing that a coach can do is have a plan
for training and development. With the end in mind, the coach must chart the
proper course to get there. Every coach should know the specific goals for the
program as well as for the individual swimmers being coached. Three basic
principles underlie training design:
• Know what you want to accomplish and when you want to do it. The first part
of any journey is identifying the destination. Whether working with age-group
swimmers, national team members, triathletes, or masters swimmers, a coach
must develop a training plan with the desired results in mind. Coaches must
consider not only the seasonal and short-term goals of the athletes but also
their long-term, career goals. The program should incorporate all aspects of an
athlete’s training and not focus only on the in-water, swimming component.
• Design the training to achieve those goals. A useful approach is to think of the
big picture first and then focus on progressively smaller intervals of time. For
example, internationally competitive athletes and coaches develop plans in four-
year blocks corresponding to the four-year Olympic cycle. Age-group coaches may
also develop multiyear plans, but thinking in one-year blocks or even competitive
seasons within the year is usually beneficial when designing a plan. Regardless of
the approach taken, the idea of planning backward should be followed. Begin by
identifying the major competition or competitions that the athlete will be training
to peak for and establish realistic performance goals for those competitions. From
that point, build the rest of the season around achieving the specified performance
goals at the specified events. Coaches must not sacrifice the goals when engaging
in planning. In some instances they may need to adjust the training and competi-
tion schedule to allow the swimmer to train through a competition or get more
rest during critical phases of the plan. If the work and planning has been done on
the front end, the eventual results will justify the approach taken.

Periodization and Planning 175
• Plan, test, and then be willing to make adaptations to the plan. Every good coach
is willing to look critically at the plan and make adjustments if the results are
not what were expected. To do this, coaches need to maintain accurate logs that
detail training load, specific sets and exercises, and athlete performance. Con-
ducting regular physical and physiological testing to monitor progress toward
the eventual goal is also important. If the season-ending swim is the only
indication of whether training is progressing along the desired path, the coach
is waiting too long. Regular monitoring and adaptation of the plan based on
athlete performance should be a cornerstone of any periodized training plan.
At its core, periodization and the process of varying a training program at
regular intervals to bring about optimal gains in physical performance should go
hand in hand with seasonal or multiyear planning. If the plan and the mechanics
underlying the plan do not align, something must be adjusted; either the goals
need to be refined to become more realistic, or the periodization strategy needs
to be adjusted to match the performance goals. Rarely does a coach nail down
a seasonal plan on the first attempt; typically, multiple iterations are required
to get everything to align in such a way that performance expectations can be
achieved at the desired competition.
Introduction to Periodization
Before going any further, the term periodization needs to be defined. The perfor-
mance literature offers a number of definitions (Bompa 1999a, 1999b; Herodek,
Simonovic, and Rakovic 2012; Issurin 2008; Stone et al. 1999). Although subtle
differences can be identified, the best definitions contain several common
themes—effective manipulation of training variables and the infusion of recovery
to achieve optimal performance results. For the purpose of this text we define
periodization as the systematic and cyclical manipulation of training variables,
including the proper prescription of rest and recovery, across a competitive season
as well as the athlete’s career, to maximize performances while maintaining the
athlete’s long-term health (Herodek, Simonovic, and Rakovic 2012). Periodiza-
tion is built on the fundamental principles of progressive overload and general
adaptation (Selye 1974, 1976). These principles state that the body will adjust and
adapt in response to increased performance or training demands (e.g., muscles
and bone will undergo changes to become stronger and handle the increased load
that comes with training). Although adaptation is described briefly in chapter
20, revisiting these principles here is useful because they underlie the theory
behind strength and sport training.
The general adaptation syndrome (GAS; Selye 1974, 1976) describes three
basic stages that the body goes through in response to stress (figure 9.1):
1. The body undergoes an immediate response to stress and enters an alarm
stage in response to a new training stimulus, such as an increase in training
load or an intense training session. In this initial phase, humans exhibit

--- Page 187 Text ---
}
176 Riewald
a fight-or-flight response that prepares the body for physical activity but
can also result in a short-term decrease in the effectiveness of the immune
system.
2. The alarm phase is followed by the adaptation or resistance stage as the
body begins the process of adapting or adjusting to the new stimuli. If the
applied stress continues beyond the initial training session, the body will
continue its efforts to adapt to the stressor; that is, muscles will become
stronger, energy systems will become more efficient at producing ATP to
support training, and so on. The body responds in this way in an attempt
to reduce the effect of this prolonged stress.
3. The third phase of the GAS is the exhaustion stage. At this point, the body
is unable to handle the applied stress. Either the stress has been excessive or
it has been applied for too long. Consequently, the body becomes unable to
adjust or repair damage caused by the stressor, typically resulting in a loss
of health or performance (i.e., symptoms of overtraining).
In response to a training stimulus or block of training, the body initially enters
an alarm state in which it is weakened and its ability to handle subsequent stress
is reduced for a time. If given repeated exposure to the stimulus, however, the
body recovers and undergoes adaptation so that it is better able to handle the
stress it experienced. If the body continues to experience stress or experiences
additional stress before adaptation occurs, the athlete proceeds to the exhaus-
tion stage and may potentially face overtraining. Consider the response that
muscle undergoes with strength training. The muscle experiences damage at the
cellular level following a heavy weight-training session (alarm). As the muscle
repairs itself, it becomes stronger and able to handle greater loads (adaptation).

Periodization and Planning 177
But if the weight or training volume is increased too quickly without allowing
adaptation to occur, injury and fatigue will occur (exhaustion).
The body can experience both beneficial stress that can drive adaptation and
performance improvements, termed eustress, and detrimental stress that can lead
to injury or overtraining, termed distress (Selye 1976). Eustress is defined by how
an athlete perceives a specific stressor (e.g., a negative threat versus a positive
challenge) (Fevre, Gregory, and Matheny 2006; Rice 2012). Eustress elicits a
positive physical or physiological response. In swimming, this response can take
the form of increased muscular strength, increased power, or improved aerobic
capacity. Distress, on the other hand, is associated with a negative response to
stress such as muscle damage, injury, or overtraining.
Left unstated in the GAS model is that adequate rest must be provided as part
of training to allow the body to recover appropriately from the training stimuli.
By structuring training in such a way that the body is given adequate time to
recover from stress before additional strenuous training is experienced, the
body will go through a phase of supercompensation after which it will emerge
stronger and better suited to handle subsequent stressors than it was before the
initial bout of training. Figure 9.2 shows how the GAS applies to performance
and how the body responds to stress. The goal of a periodization plan is to cycle
the stress and rest appropriately to provide a challenging training stimulus but
also give the body time to recover. By structuring training in this way, a swimmer
should never enter the exhaustion stage but will experience supercompensation
and get progressively stronger and faster.

The concept of general adaptation is tied directly to the principle of progres-
sive overload. Progressive overload is the process of gradually increasing the
stress placed on the body during training. It is based on the philosophy that if a
training stimulus is increased gradually over time, the body will be able to adapt
appropriately. But if a swimmer is asked to do too much, too soon, whether it is a
dramatic increase in training volume in the pool or a large increase in resistance
in a dryland program, the chance for injury increases or the body will not be
able to adapt fully to the stressor.
If used correctly, the principles of general adaptation and progressive overload
can work in harmony to help athletes improve performance, whether in the
weight room or in the pool. Figure 9.3 illustrates how this works. A training stimu-
lus is applied, and the body is given an opportunity to recover. Subsequently,
the body enters a phase of supercompensation. In this state a subsequent and
increased stimulus can be applied to improve the training response further and
move the body to a new equilibrium state. This process can continue in perpe-
tuity and forms the foundation of periodized training in swimming and sport.
A Brief History of Periodization
For as long as historical athletic records have been kept, the best athletes in the
world have recognized the benefits of periodized training, starting with the
ancient Greeks preparing for the Games of the ancient Olympiad. More recently,
nations such as the Soviet Union have used periodized training to maximize
performance in athletes across a wide range of sports. Metveyev (1966) and

Periodization and Planning 179
Bompa (1999a, 1999b) are thought of as the modern-day pioneers in periodized
training design because they expanded the thinking about this training method
and formally organized many of the principles that underlie periodization.
Building on their work, coaches and scientists have continued to advance the
concept of periodization, resulting in increasingly complex, but arguably more
performance-focused, periodization models. Scientific validation of periodized
training methods also became more commonplace throughout the late 20th
and early 21st centuries (Zatsiorsky and Kraemer 2006; Siff and Verkhoshansky
1999). As a result, periodized training principles are now being applied with
positive results to a wide range of sports.
Interpreting the Periodization Literature
One of the greatest rewards of putting together a well-planned periodized training
program is that a coach can design training so that swimmers will peak at spe-
cific, identified competitions. Although the point has been made that swimmers
should be able to race fast at virtually any time of the year, most swimmers truly
want to perform their best at one competition each season—where the physi-
cal, physiological, and mental sides of swimming all come together to achieve
a peak performance. In high school, this event may be the season-ending high
school championships. In college, it could be the NCAA or conference cham-
pionships. A masters swimmer may want to peak for the long-course nationals
at the end of the summer. One of the main tenets of periodization training is
that training can be structured to allow athletes to achieve peak performances
at critical times of the year.
The research conducted in the area of periodization and training is extensive
and diverse. Periodization has been examined from a variety of perspectives.
The data show overwhelmingly that periodization training is superior to other
training methods for developing athletic performance. Rather than provide an
extensive discussion of what the research shows, the following section highlights
some of the key findings (and some shortcomings) as well as what this informa-
tion means to coaches.
• Most research studies, regardless of the method of periodization employed
by the coach, show superior performance gains compared with nonperi-
odized training (Stone et al. 1999; Rhea and Alderman 2004; Kiely 2012).
The findings are equivocal, however, because in some rare instances, stud-
ies show that periodized training models are not superior with regard to
improving athlete performance.
• Some have suggested that the improvements seen with periodized train-
ing result from the fact that athletes ultimately engage in a greater overall
workload. When volume and intensity are controlled, the argument goes,
periodized training produces results similar to those obtained from non-
periodized training. Thus, a causal relationship was established in which
more training leads to better results. Even with that taken into account, the

superiority of periodized training programs has been shown to occur when
volume of training was held constant between experimental and control
groups. Performance improvements were shown to be greater, however, in
periodized programs in which athletes could train at higher volumes and
intensities (Rhea and Alderman 2004).
• The results are equivocal as to whether periodized training is most effective
in trained or untrained populations (i.e., who sees the greatest performance
gains?). With that said, different forms of periodization appear to be better
suited for specific athlete populations. Linear periodization is associated
more with improvements in beginning athletes, whereas more complex
nonlinear models of periodization training are best suited for developing
performance in experienced athletes. (Note: Linear and nonlinear periodiza-
tion methods are outlined in detail later in the chapter.)
• Females benefit as much from periodized training as males do. Although
men tend to have greater absolute strength, women are as responsive (and
in some cases more so) to periodized training as men (Kell 2011).
• Variation within a periodized program is crucial to performance (Bompa
1999a, 1999b; Stone et al. 1999; Rhea and Alderman 2004). In fact, some
have postulated that the variation inherent to periodized training is what
facilitates performance improvements, not the actual seasonal structure of
the plan (Kiely 2012).
• Training plans, even periodized plans, need to factor in aspects of growth
and development. Younger athletes who have not reached biological matu-
rity will likely not spend the same amount of time trying to build power
and maximal strength as older athletes might.
• Most important for swimming coaches, periodized training has been shown
to enhance performance in swimmers (Stewart and Hopkins 2000; Thomas,
Mujika, and Busso 2008; Touretski 2000; Pyne and Touretski 2003).
Note that some in the scientific community are concerned that periodiza-
tion methodology has not been appropriately vetted and that coaches therefore
cannot definitively say whether periodized training provides the benefits that
they claim. Concern exists in some circles that periodization has been some-
what blindly accepted as a superior training method without having the data to
back that claim. Along those lines, when reviewing the periodization literature,
consider the following:
• Group-based observations may be misleading because the information is
often too general to capture the responses of individuals. Research is inher-
ently based on the assumption that all athletes will respond similarly to an
applied training stimuli. This is known not to be the case. For any training
scenario, a core group of athletes will show improvement. In addition, a
smaller group will outstrip the mean. But some athletes will not improve
or may even regress in performance. For this reason, even the best laid per-

--- Page 192 Text ---
|
Periodization and Planning 181
formance plans must be adapted and modified to meet the specific needs
of the individual swimmer (Kiely 2012).
• Similarly, an underlying assumption is that accurate predictions can be made
about how the body will adapt to training, when in fact any number of causal
factors can affect how a swimmer responds. Individual athletes can respond
differently when presented with identical training stimuli. Identical training
sessions performed by the same person will elicit unique training responses
as well, based on the context in which the workout was presented (training
phase, previous training, and so forth) (Rhea and Alderman 2004; Kiely 2012).
• In the field of periodization research, most of the findings highlight short-term
results and do not provide any longitudinal or long-term data or outcomes.
• Could it simply be the variation provided or the increased training load
afforded the athlete that leads to the observed performance gains across ath-
letes and sports, not the periodized programming per se? In fact, a number
of studies have shown that variation alone can lead to performance gains
and a reduction in overtraining.
Armed with this information about what the research says about periodiza-
tion, let’s dig a bit deeper into the understanding of what periodization is and
how it can be used to influence swimming performance.
Training Objectives
Within a Periodized Program
The basic theory behind periodization is that by rotating through various phases
or training cycles, each of which focuses on developing a different training vari-
able or set of variables, we can stress different systems more completely than
if they were all trained at the same time throughout the year. Additionally, the
common thought is that some fundamental building blocks should be put in
place before more complex skills are developed; for example, strength should be
developed before attempts are made to develop power. By approaching training
design in this way and building on a foundation of skills developed over time,
the swimmer can experience performance gains weekly, monthly, and yearly,
in both the pool and the weight room.
Coaches and athletes need to understand the training objectives that can be
incorporated into the phases of a periodized plan. A number of objectives and
goals can be targeted through training, depending on things such as training
phase, age, and time of the year, including the following.
Anatomical Adaptation and Injury Prevention
At specific times of the year, particularly at the start of a season, athletes should
focus on building strength balance throughout the body. They should target
weak muscle groups that, if not strengthened, could predispose them to injury.

Recovery and Regeneration
Following the season, swimmers need to have a period in which they can recharge
their batteries and recovery both physically and mentally before the next season
or training phase begins.
Maximal Strength
Maximal strength refers to the greatest amount of force that a swimmer can
generate in one all-out effort. Maximal strength is commonly measured as the
amount of weight that a person can lift (or force that can be generated) in a
one-repetition max (1RM) test. Although swimmers may not attempt to develop
maximal strength per se, at times during the training cycle they will want to
develop increased strength throughout the body.
Strength Endurance
Strength endurance is the ability to produce a specified level of force repeatedly
without becoming fatigued. Typically, the level of force generated in any one
contraction when swimming is not maximal, but it may represent a high per-
centage of a swimmer’s force-generating capacity in specific muscles or muscle
groups. Strength endurance is critically important for swimmers because of the
repetitive nature of the sport; for a swimmer to perform well and remain free
from injury, many muscles need to have strength endurance. Several specific
muscles or muscle groups come to mind:
• Scapular stabilizers, which control the shoulder blades and maintain proper
positioning of the shoulder joint
• Core muscles, which control body posture in the water
• Muscles of the rotator cuff and upper back, which are responsible for gen-
erating upper-body propulsion
• Muscles of the hip, which drive the propulsive kick
Strategies to develop strength endurance should be incorporated into strength-
training plans for these muscle groups.
Power
Power is the ability of the neuromuscular system to produce large forces in a
short time. Mathematically, muscle power equals muscle force multiplied by
contraction velocity. Power is an important aspect of performance in swim-
ming, especially in certain muscle groups in which explosiveness is required to
achieve optimal performance. For example, power is needed in the lower-limb
extensors to drive the start or push-off from the wall following a turn. Power
in the upper-body musculature is beneficial to sprint performance and to the
ability to shift into another gear at the end of a longer race.

Periodization and Planning 183
Power Endurance
Power endurance refers to the ability to perform powerful actions repeatedly
while experiencing little or no fatigue.
Muscle Hypertrophy
Hypertrophy training is designed to maximize muscle size, not necessarily
strength. In general, strength training designed for swimmers should not focus
on gaining muscle size.
Strength Maintenance
During the competition phase of a periodized plan, strength and conditioning
should be maintained at the levels that were developed over the course of the
previous phases. Typically, strength gains can be maintained by engaging in at
least one strength-training session per week that includes a small number of
exercises involving multiple muscle groups.
General Physical Development
This approach focuses on developing physical fitness as well as foundational
strength and conditioning. A training phase targeted at general physical devel-
opment includes elements of flexibility training, agility, strength, coordination,
balance, as well as other physical attributes associated with general athleticism.
Sport-Specific Physical Development
This aspect of training focuses on the development of the physical and physi-
ological attributes directly related to performance. For swimmers, this work
could include in-water strength and power training or dryland training targeted
at improving performance in a specific stroke or race distance.
Psychological Development
At certain times of the season, it may be important to develop mental skills that
contribute to swimming performance, such as resilience, determination, and
confidence. Practices and training can be structured to emphasize the develop-
ment of certain mental attributes.
Technical Proficiency
Swimming technique is even more important than strength in the effect on
performance in the pool. As such, technique should be a critical component of
training. In addition, at certain times of the year a preferential focus should be
directed to developing aspects of technique.

Basic Concepts of Periodization
When discussing periodization, the words macrocycle, mesocycle, and microcycle
are commonly used to describe periods of training. These words represent dif-
ferent phases of the periodized training plan. The following section provides
more detail about each of these phases. We start with the shortest element, the
microcycle, and build to the macrocycle, discussing how all three period types
fit within an annual plan.
Microcycle
A microcycle is the smallest unit of planning within the periodized plan.
The length of the microcycle in a training plan is typically a week, but it can
last anywhere from 4 to 10 days. The microcycle can be built to focus on the
development of a specific performance variable or combination of program
variables. For example, microcycles can be designed to elicit high levels of
fatigue, develop power, promote skill development, facilitate recovery, or reach
other goals. Managing the training load during the microcycle is crucial. Within
the microcycle, planned variation should occur as well. Training volume and
intensity should be varied to achieve the desired level of adaptation. As far as
presenting guidelines about constructing a microcycle, Bompa (1999b) provides
the following advice:
• The objectives of the microcycle and the aspect of performance being tar-
geted should be clearly identified.
• Coaches need to set the specifics of training for each day—sets, repetitions,
intensity, rest—as well as plan the overall intensity of the microcycle.
• Coaches should clearly identify the methods (exercises, modalities, and so
forth) to be used in developing the targeted physical or physiologic perfor-
mance characteristics.
• As a rule of thumb, a microcycle should start at low to medium intensity
and progress to higher intensity later in the microcycle.
• Athletes should engage in training sessions with similar objectives two
or three times within a microcycle, ideally every second day, to achieve a
training effect.
• Within the microcycle, swimmers should be trained to their limit in the
targeted area on one or at most two days. At least one day per week should
be focused on low-intensity exercise or active rest and recovery.
Figure 9.4 illustrates a moderate-intensity microcycle that includes two high-
intensity (Hi) days of training, two moderate days (M), two low-intensity days
(L), and one recovery day (R). Intensity can be varied as needed to achieve the
desired performance objective within the microcycle.

Mesocycle
A mesocycle represents the next longest block of training within a periodized
program. It typically has a duration ranging from two to eight weeks. If each
microcycle is approximately one week in length, a mesocycle typically incorpo-
rates two to eight microcycles.
More important, a mesocycle is often set up as a specific phase of a training
plan that focuses on the development of certain physical attributes that will
prepare the athlete for a certain aspect of competition. As discussed later in the
chapter, a swimming season can be broken into preparatory, training, competi-
tion, and active rest, or transition, phases. Each of those phases corresponds to
a mesocycle within the training plan and is directed toward achieving specific
training or performance goals and objectives.
A mesocycle should be set up to provide a swimmer the opportunity to
achieve true training adaptations. A period of six to eight weeks is typically
needed to cause that change, at least when developing physical attributes such
as strength or cardiovascular endurance. The full season should be considered
to identify how the mesocycles can be incorporated; an appropriate amount of
time is needed to provide an adequate training stimulus while also allowing the
swimmer to accomplish the goals of the seasonal plan. Just as training volume
and intensity should vary within a microcycle, the intensity of microcycles
should be periodized within a mesocycle. Figure 9.5 shows how the intensity
can be varied over a four-week period to provide a training stimulus as well as
an opportunity to recover.

Note that variety and variation should still be critical elements of the meso-
cycle design (figure 9.6). Within an eight-week preparatory phase, a mesocycle
in which the major emphasis may be on building muscular endurance and
aerobic capacity, a coach will likely focus primarily on the development of those
performance variables. But several one-week microcycles that emphasize power
development or technique work may also be incorporated into the plan. Taking
this approach will keep training fresh while still targeting a specific training goal.

Macrocycle
The macrocycle is the largest phase within a periodized plan. It typically refers
to a full swimming season. For Olympians, the macrocycle might represent the
four-year block of time between Olympic Games. For the age-group swimmer,
it could represent the short-course season or the long-course competitive season
within the year. The goal is for the swimmer to peak at least once during the
macrocycle at an identified key competition.
No hard-and-fast rules govern what constitutes a macrocycle within a peri-
odized plan. Many coaches develop a periodized plan in which the macrocycle
constitutes the entire year of training and competition. The macrocycle is
made up of a series of mesocycles, or training phases, linked together to form
a comprehensive training plan. If the athlete is expected to peak once during
the entire calendar year, the term annual plan can be used synonymously and
interchangeably with macrocycle. But if two seasons occur within the calendar
year (e.g., a short-course season and a long-course season), the annual plan will
be made up of two macrocycles.
There is a method to the madness, and the cycles within a periodized plan
build on each other:
• Days of training are grouped together to form one- to two-week microcycles.
• Microcycles are grouped together to form mesocycles, which represent
phases of the training plan, each with a defined goal and training focus
within the seasonal plan.
• Mesocycles are grouped together to form macrocycles, which typically
represent a competitive season that culminates in a performance at the key
competition identified when the seasonal plan was put together.
Types of Periodization
Since the concept of periodization was first introduced, coaches have approached
this training design in a number of ways. This section illustrates some of the
methods used to put together periodized programs and discusses the pros and
cons associated with each.
Linear Periodization
The classical periodized model described by Matveyev (1966) is typified by a pro-
gressive transition from high-volume, moderate-intensity training to low-volume,
high-intensity work over the course of the macrocycle. The linear periodized
model (figure 9.7) generally follows an approach that progresses through phases
or mesocycles that have the targeted goal of increasing strength and power in the
lead-up to an identified key competition. Training focus begins with foundational
strength development and then moves to maximal strength development, power
development, and peaking for a major competition. An active rest phase follows.

 Figure 9.7 Example of a classical, or linear, periodization model. In a linear
periodization model, the training volume decreases while training intensity increases
E5192/Riewald/fig09.07/498677/alw/r2
over the course of a season, or macrocycle. Technique work also increases roughly in
parallel with training intensity. Technique work, intensity, and volume all drop during
the lead-in to the peak competition.
The linear model uses specific time intervals to develop only one training
variable at a time. Athletes progress from week to week trying to improve their
performance by using larger loads, more repetitions or sets, decreased rest
between sets, and so on. As the athlete progresses through the season, the focus
shifts to technique and sport-specific exercises as well.
Although many coaches are likely familiar with the linear model and athletes
have been shown to improve performance using these methods, some important
considerations must be taken into account when putting together a linear train-
ing plan (Herodek, Simonovic, and Rakovic 2012). The proper manipulation
of volume is necessary, and coaches must be sure to weigh the overall train-
ing volume (in-water swimming plus dryland training plus other stressors) to
ensure that athletes do not become overtrained. Additionally, when following
a model in which strength is built early in the year and then neglected for the
sake of developing power later in the macrocycle, the swimmer may not be able
to maintain strength gains across the season.
Within the classical, or linear, periodization model, the assumption is often
made that little or no variation should occur within the plan (e.g., athletes
progress consistently in exercise intensity, always going upward and forward,

--- Page 200 Text ---
|
Periodization and Planning 189
without much rest or variety in training load). In the purest sense of the linear
periodized model, that approach is in fact the case. But in truth, variation of
training volume and intensity can be added to various phases of the plan to
stimulate additional gains while allowing multiple performance factors to be
developed, or maintained, simultaneously. This type of periodization model
is more often referred to as nonlinear, or undulating, periodization, and this
approach is outlined in detail later.
Generally, the linear method is thought to be a good model for beginning ath-
letes or those who are engaging in training for the first time, either in the weight
room or the pool. This method of training starts with higher volume and lower-
intensity exercise, and it facilitates the development of a foundation of strength,
skill, and technique. The progression through the training plan promotes slow
and stable adaptation as well as performance progression. The main drawback
of the classical, or linear, method is that when attention is being devoted to the
development of one physical attribute, the others potentially suffer.
Reverse Linear Periodization
Like the linear periodization model, the reverse linear plan follows a consistent
shift in focus over the course of a macrocycle, although the approach is oppo-
site what is seen in the classic model. Rather than focusing ultimately on power
development, the goal of a reverse linear periodization plan for swimmers would
be to maximize muscle endurance (Herodek, Sinonovic, and Rakovic 2012).
The research in this area supports the idea that this technique is more effective
than the classic, or linear, periodization model at building muscular endurance.
The reverse linear periodization plan typically includes the following elements:
• Power phase, in which intensity is high
• Strength phase
• Moderate repetition phase
• Endurance phase, in which the focus in the weight room is on executing
a large number of repetitions (20 to 30) of identified exercises at moder-
ate intensity while also engaging in in-water training to complement the
dryland training
• Active rest
At the end of the macrocycle, a swimmer should have greater muscular endur-
ance that can help with performance in distance events.
Nonlinear, or Undulating, Periodization
Undulating, or nonlinear, periodization adds an aspect of variety to a training
program by adjusting training variables more frequently than the linear model
does (Herodek, Simonovic, and Rakovic 2012; Issurin 2008; Zatsiorsky and
Kraemer 2006; Plisk and Stone 2003; Brown 2001). With an undulating program,

--- Page 201 Text ---
}
190 Riewald
the intensity, volume, exercise selection, and training modality change as often
as every day of training. Even with variety, a linear increase or decrease can still
occur in these variables over time. But one of the hallmarks of a true nonlinear
model is that a consistent, linear progression in training parameters does not
occur over time.
Another benefit of adopting an undulating approach is that although a meso-
cycle or microcycle may have a specific training focus, multiple training goals can
be addressed simultaneously within a certain phase of training. This approach
is beneficial to swimmers who compete frequently. In addition, a great deal of
flexibility is available to make adaptations within a training block or a season.
Although variability is the greatest strength of the undulating model, it is also
the greatest concern. A coach may develop a scattered plan that tries to address the
development of too many performance variables at the same time. If the focus of
training is spread too thinly across too many training modalities, the result will
be suboptimal performance because not enough work will have been devoted
to maximizing performance in any one area. Planned reduction in variation at
certain times of the year can allow an athlete to focus on the development of a
specific skill or set of skills and potentially accelerate development in those areas.
Is nonlinear periodization more successful than classical training design
methods at developing athletes? The jury is still out, because many periodization
training models have been shown to enhance performance. But a recent meta-
analysis of periodized training programs suggests that undulating periodiza-
tion may be superior to traditional linear programs when it comes to building
strength. These findings can be extended to describe the development of other
physical or physiological parameters as well.
Conjugated Method of Periodization
As mentioned, linear models of periodization typically take a sequential
approach to training design because one performance variable is developed, fol-
lowed by another, and another, and so on. Conjugated, or concurrent, methods
of periodization seek to develop multiple, and sometimes all, abilities simul-
taneously. This doesn’t necessarily mean that all abilities are developed in one
training session, but they are developed with the same phase of training and
across the entire training plan.
One potential problem with this approach is that efforts may become spread
too thinly across too many areas. Abilities that need a greater focus, or volume
of work, to develop may not be maximized with this approach. A variation to
this method is to touch on all training factors throughout a mesocycle but to
emphasize only one or a few of them during any one phase of training. This
approach allows a swimmer to concentrate on a particular ability, or set of
abilities, while maintaining others, reducing the fear that untrained attributes
will regress.
On the surface, this approach seems similar to the linear periodization model.
However, each microcycle and each mesocycle can include tremendous variation

--- Page 202 Text ---
|
Periodization and Planning 191
of volume, intensity, and exercise selection. Additionally, although each micro-
cycle or mesocycle has a focus, that does not mean that other physical attributes
can’t be trained as well. The key to this approach is to emphasize and develop
specific attributes while maintaining all others with minimal volume. With this
approach, the athlete can optimally adapt to one stimulus while maintaining
others and avoiding stagnation, overtraining, and fatigue. This focused method
of periodization is based on the premise that an elite athlete is unable to adapt
to and recover from a large number of stimuli at the same time. These athletes
benefit more from a concentrated and focused effort on a particular ability. After
some time, the emphasis can be switched to developing another ability.
Taken to the extreme, the focused conjugated approach to training design can
lead to the development of what is called block periodization (Fevre, Gregory,
and Matheny 2006; Issurin 2010). The general idea behind block periodiza-
tion is that it uses sequenced, specialized mesocycle blocks in which highly
concentrated training is provided to develop a minimal number of motor and
technical abilities. The structured sequencing of specialized mesocycle blocks
leverages and exploits residual training effects from prior blocks to develop
physical and physiologic capacities more fully. Different mesocycles focus on
attributes that build on one another, ultimately to optimize performance. These
methods have been shown to elicit performance improvements in elite athletes
across a number of sports. In fact, conjugated periodization is thought by some
to be the preferential model of training for experienced athletes. As it relates
specifically to swimming, block periodization methods have been employed
to train Olympic and world champions (Touretski 2000; Pyne and Touretski
2003; Vorontsov 2011).
Phases of a Periodized Model
In most sports a competitive season can be broken into phases, each of which
has a primary goal and training focus. Bompa (1999a, 1999b) and others iden-
tify three phases within a periodized plan and apply this general model to all
sports and athletes:
1. Preparation phase, in which the focus is on building physical and physi-
ological capacities
2. Competition phase, in which the focus is primarily on the maintenance of
strength and performance through the competitive season
3. Transition phase, which is designed to provide a period of recovery while
allowing athletes to transition from one season or macrocycle into another
Issurin (2008, 2010) also defines three phases, or mesocycles, within his
description of block periodization:
1. Accumulation phase, which is devoted to developing basic abilities such as
aerobic capacity, foundational strength, and movement technique

--- Page 203 Text ---
}
192 Riewald
2. Transformation phase, which is focused on developing sport-specific abili-
ties such as muscular endurance or power or building anaerobic capacity
3. Realization phase, which is dedicated to competition preparation and is
focused on maximal speed, recovery, and race modeling
These three mesocycles are repeated throughout the year to enhance performance
and allow multiple peaks throughout the season.
Swimming is somewhat different from other sports in the way that the com-
petitive season is structured. The phases within the periodized model can be
reworked to account for this. The model proposed by Bompa has been modified
slightly to include one additional mesocycle:
Phase I: preparation phase focused on building a foundation of strength and
preparing the body for the demands of training and competition
Phase II: training phase during which the focus shifts to building strength,
power, endurance, and the sport-specific attributes needed for a swimmer
to succeed in the water
Phase III: competition phase, which includes peaking for the major competi-
tion
Phase IV: transition or active rest phase in which athletes have an opportunity
to recover, both physically and mentally, after a competitive season
Each phase serves a specific purpose in preparing the athlete for the unique
demands of training and competition.
Phase I: Preparation Phase
At the start of the season, the schedule should include a period during which
the training is focused on anatomical adaptation and building a foundation
of general strength and conditioning to prepare the body for the intense train-
ing to come. Specifically, the preparatory phase should include the following
goals:
• Build strength throughout the body, targeting all muscle groups but focusing
on the muscles of the core and stabilizers, such as the scapular stabilizers,
shoulder girdle, and hip complex.
• Develop balance throughout the body. Swimmers are subject to strength
imbalances such as trunk flexors being stronger than trunk extensors and
shoulder internal rotators being stronger than external rotators. This time
should be used to balance the body by preferentially targeting the weaker
muscle groups.
• Build a base of aerobic conditioning and have athletes become accustomed
to the regularity of training, which includes regaining a feel for the water
and developing warm-up and precompetition routines.
• Work on technique and stroke consistency and efficiency.

--- Page 204 Text ---
|
Periodization and Planning 193
Typically, athletes enter into the preparation phase after a transition phase
or a period of active rest. Essentially, the preparation phase serves as a time for
athletes to refamiliarize themselves with the water and build strength and con-
ditioning.
Phase II: Training Phase
The focus of the training phase is to develop increased levels of strength and
conditioning as well as to translate that strength into sport-specific strength and
conditioning that can enhance performance. Several specific guidelines should
be followed during this phase:
• Training should be structured to build high levels of strength and estab-
lish a foundation of conditioning over 4 to 12 weeks. The duration of this
phase depends on the structure of the season and the overall length of the
macrocycle.
• The strength achieved in the initial weeks of this phase forms the founda-
tion for the power needed by sprinters or the muscular endurance needed
by distance swimmers. Peak performances likely will be determined by the
work done in this phase.
• Toward the end of this phase, the focus should shift to developing power
for sprinters or muscular endurance for distance athletes. Coaches should
plan to devote four or five weeks to the development of power or six to eight
weeks to allow the physical and physiological adaptations to take place for
muscular endurance (Bompa 1999a, 1999b).
• In some programs, the training phase is further broken down into general
and specific training elements. General preparation may focus on develop-
ing generic elements of fitness, such as building an aerobic base, whereas
specific training develops swimming-specific strength and power while the
swimmer also learns to apply that power to the water.
Phase III: Competition Phase
The competition phase represents the main part of the competitive season,
culminating in the season-ending championship meet. Much of the focus of
training in this phase is on maintaining strength and power gains made during
the training phase and continuing the development of sport-specific skills.
Swimmers should build on the work put in during the training phase by
making in-water training more event and stroke specific. Additional emphasis
should be placed on swimming fast every day and working on race-specific speed
and mechanics, such as stroke rates and cycle counts.
Strength training and conditioning work becomes more swimming and event
specific, focusing on developing either muscular endurance or power. In general,
power development necessitates increasing training intensity, decreasing volume,
and incorporating power-based exercises into the training plan. To develop

muscular endurance, swimmers have to execute a large number of repetitions
of swimming-specific exercises against moderate to high resistance. Research
has shown that periodized training using resisted and assisted sprint training
can develop strength endurance in the pool and can be seen as an option for
building those swimming-specific skills (Girold et al. 2006).
Training should be done with an intensity and a work-to-rest ratio that reflect
the demands of the race to be swum. Strength maintenance and development
should not be neglected during this phase because detraining can occur rapidly
if strength training is stopped.
The emphasis leading up the championship meet should be recovery and
energy replenishment as well as fine-tuning things in preparation for competi-
tion. Strength training should be scaled back and even cease in the week before
the key competition of the year.
Research shows that detraining and performance decrements can occur
within a week after training ceases. The maximum time that swimmers should
be expected to hold at their peak is about three weeks. After that, performance
decrements occur, so swimmers need to go back to the training phase or the
start of the competition phase.
Phase IV: Transition Phase
At the end of the competitive season swimmers should take a mental and physical
break to recover. Although recovery is the focus of this phase, it is not supposed
to be a time of physical inactivity. Activity should be reduced by 60 to 70 percent,
and athletes can engage in cross-training activities to provide training variety.
Athletes should try to get in the pool every couple of days to maintain a feel
for the water, but they do not need to engage in intense swimming workouts.
The longer that swimmers stay in the transition phase, the more likely they
are to experience detraining effects such as loss of conditioning or strength.
Although the individual characteristics of the athletes should determine the
length of this phase, it should last at least two weeks to allow physical and
mental recovery but not more than four to six weeks to minimize detraining.
If athletes choose to cease strength training during this phase, they should
still engage in training the core and the stabilizer muscles throughout the
body. This work will help minimize the time they need to spend regaining lost
strength in the subsequent preparatory phase.
Remember that cycles should appear in each phase. For example, even a
sprinter who is in the training phase focused on power development should
have days in which the primary training focus is on developing muscular endur-
ance. Cycling periods of work and rest that include manipulation of intensity
and frequency and variation of exercises are important for staying fresh and
achieving peak performances.
A coach who follows the approach of breaking a season into phases and
focusing training to achieve certain goals within each phase can maximize the

|
Periodization and Planning 195
chances of achieving peak performances at the most important competitions
throughout the year. Periodization produces better results than traditional
training methods do for many reasons, but one of the most important aspects
is that periodization incorporates planned periods of rest and recovery.
One common observation, even when swimmers are following a periodized
plan, is that athletes typically go through a period of performance decline
during the training and early competition phases. This decline manifests itself
in the form of decreased power output (Sharp 1986) as measured with dry-
land swim bench testing and decreased pulling force in the pool (Vorontsov
2011). These findings bring into focus the importance of rest not only within
the training plan but also during the taper leading into the main com-
petition.
When applied appropriately, periodization models can result in perfor-
mance improvements in both the weight room and the pool. As one example,
leading into the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games, Gennadi Touretski, coach of
Alexander Popov and Michael Klim, used the block periodization method
to prepare his swimmers to achieve world records in their respective events.
Other coaches and scientists have shown that periodized models can be used
to help swimmers attain peak performances (Pyne and Touretski 2003).
Rest and Recovery as Part
of the Periodization Model
If swimmers train long enough and hard enough, their bodies will eventually
tell them that they need to take a break. For some, it may be an illness that
forces them to stop training. For others, it may be an injury. One of the major
benefits of a periodized training plan is that rest and recovery are integral ele-
ments of the plan. Periods of rest are scheduled into each training microcycle,
mesocycle, and macrocycle.
Within each week swimmers need to take time to allow the body to recover
from the stress that they experience over the course of a microcycle. Most pro-
grams traditionally build one off day into the microcycle for rest and recovery.
Other programs may take a slightly different approach and implement a four-to-
one training schedule; athletes engage in four training sessions followed by one
session off. For programs that hold two training sessions a day, athletes would
have double practices on days 1 and 2 in the microcycle and only one workout
on the third day.
Most athletes benefit by taking at least one full day off from training during
each microcycle to allow additional time for recovery. Although most coaches
incorporate one full day of rest into each training microcycle, others conduct
training sessions every day of the week and have good results. Nevertheless,
most believe that that some time away from the pool within each training week
is valuable.

Understanding the Taper
The swimming season usually culminates in a taper period, a period of reduced
training volume, leading up to a major competition. The purpose of the taper is
to reduce the physical, physiological, mental, and emotional stress placed on the
body so that it can fully recover by the time the major competition rolls around.
Tapering is built into the culture of swimming, and some tapering is necessary
for swimmers to fine-tune their technique and race strategy. But many coaches
and athletes place too much importance on the taper and see it as the thing that
makes or breaks the season.
In several ways, placing too much emphasis on the taper goes against the
general philosophy of training periodization. Consider this: The theory behind
the taper is that the swimmer has stressed the body so much that he needs to
take an extended period to recover leading into the main competition. In a
properly designed training plan, structured rest is built into the training, so the
swimmer should never get to extreme levels of fatigue. A swimmer should be
prepared to swim fast at any time during the season. The taper should provide
that little bit extra to allow the swimmer to achieve a best race performance.
Chapter 10 provides more in-depth information on how the taper should be
structured.
Building a Periodized Training Plan
When putting together a periodized plan, the best approach is to build the plan
backward. Start by identifying the major competitions during the year and then
fill in the rest of the plan. Building a periodized training plan, especially for the
first time, is an iterative process. Even a seasoned coach cannot be expected to
get everything to line up and fit into the season correctly the first time the pen
is put to paper. Follow these steps to put together a periodized program:
1. Identify the most important swimming meets of the season and work
backward from there. Identify those competitions as well as any taper time
leading up to them and block them out first.
2. Schedule active rest phases. Block out one to two weeks after each major
competition to be used to cross-train and to take a break from swimming.
Waiting to plan rest until everything else is put into the plan often results
in the recovery time being left out of the schedule entirely.
3. Each active rest phase should be followed by an appropriate preliminary
phase that will be used to get the swimmer back into the flow of swim
training, both in the water and on dry land.
4. Map out a time following each preliminary phase to build foundational
strength and conditioning and then transition to swimming-specific strength
(the training phase). This part of the season can last longer and be broken
into multiple mesocycles if the team or specific athletes have that luxury.

--- Page 208 Text ---
|
Periodization and Planning 197
5. Lay out the competition phase for the season. This phase should last at least
four weeks. The program continues to transition the athlete to building
swimming-specific strength and power.
6. Become even more detailed in the planning. Outline the goals for each
macrocycle, mesocycle, and microcycle. Although each training phase
should have major themes, include variability and work that maintains
the physical and physiological attributes that are not the primary focus of
the training block.
Summary
Periodization offers the potential to add variety to training while eliciting
improved results. Coaches should plan training to develop the necessary skills
at the right time of the season. A poorly designed or poorly executed plan will
not produce the desired results. Besides identifying the primary physical and
physiological attributes to be developed, coaches need to provide athletes with
variation in their workouts.
Coaches need to know their athletes and monitor how they respond to train-
ing. One of the strong points of periodization is that it allows flexibility and
variability. Most approaches to periodization inherently assume that physical
and physiological adaptations to training follow a predicable course and there-
fore that it is possible to predict how training phases will interact with others
and build toward a specific goal.
Variation is key, but only to a point. Variation in volume, intensity, and other
training variables provides a stimulus for the body to respond and adapt. But
goals and areas of focus should change as a swimmer progresses through the
season. Too much variation will not allow the targeted physiological or physical
systems to be trained to their fullest (Kiely 2012).
Consider all the stresses and stimuli present in an athlete’s life when putting
together a plan. Be willing to adapt and make course corrections if things do
not seem to be going in the right direction or at the desired pace.
Build the plan but don’t be concerned if it is not perfect the first time. Few
coaches are able to put together a seasonal plan and have all the elements fit
together properly the first time they write things out. Do not think that you have
to try the most complicated periodization model first. Start simple and build in
complexity over time.
Maintain accurate records and logs of performance so that you can later evalu-
ate the success or failure of certain training approaches. Do not be afraid to tap
into the expertise of other professionals. Coaches need to wear many hats. If
you can bring in someone who can help with seasonal planning or at least lend
some advice, take advantage of the opportunity.
Consider that in-water and dryland training need to complement each other.
Both aspects are typically factored into a plan when one coach runs the entire
training program (although that may not always be the case). Things can go off

--- Page 209 Text ---
}

the rails quickly if the dryland work does not complement what is done in the
pool. This point applies to scheduling rest and recovery as much as it is does to
devising a plan to develop strength, power, endurance, and technique.
The information presented here provides guidelines and specific information
about designing and implementing a periodized training plan. Periodized pro-
grams provide several benefits, and coaches can design a plan in many ways. Take
things easy and do not expect to become a master of periodization overnight.
If you are able to incorporate even some of these elements into your training
plan, your swimmers will benefit in both their health and their performance.

CHAPTER
The Effect of Tapering
on Performance
—Iñigo Mujika, PhD, and Andrew M. Stewart, PhD
Information concerning the periodization of the training cycle within and
between swimming seasons was presented in chapter 9. That chapter pre-
sented evidence about the need for coaches to adjust training variables such as
volume and intensity to promote performance improvements and maximize
race performance. Within a typical training cycle, swimmers place the body
under tremendous stress to maximize the development of the physical and
physiological capacities important for swimming performance. In preparation
for the main competition, athletes typically engage in a period of relative rest,
called the taper, to allow for recovery while also preparing themselves physically
and mentally to perform at their best.
Most agree that the taper forms an integral phase within the program of any
serious athlete’s preparation for competition. Where debate does exist, it can be
roughly summarized in four key areas:
1. The length of the taper for the individual athlete
2. The structure, or shape, of the taper
3. The optimal combination of training load within the most appropriate
taper structure
4. The best way to prepare an athlete for multiple swims over different dis-
tances and strokes within any given competition and for competition in
year-round events, specifically given the relatively recent addition of a global
short-course season to the historical long-course calendar
All these areas depend to some extent on the training that takes place through-
out the swimming season, in particular the phase of training (overload or over-
reaching) just before tapering. Each of these factors is considered in this chapter.

Taper Overview
As we begin, let us set the scene to make sure that we are speaking the same lan-
guage of periodization and, in particular, tapering. Over the past few decades,
authors and coaches have described the taper in various ways:
• A decrease in work level that the competitive swimmer undergoes during
practice to rest and prepare for a good performance (Yamamoto, Mutoh,
and Miyashita 1988)
• A specialized exercise training technique that has been designed to reverse
training-induced fatigue without loss of training adaptations (Neary et al.
1992)
• An incremental reduction in training volume for 7 to 21 days before a
championship race (Houmard and Johns 1994)
• A progressive, nonlinear reduction of the training load during a variable
amount of time that is intended to reduce the physiological and psycho-
logical stress of daily training and optimize sport performance (Mujika
and Padilla 2000)
• A segment of time when the training load is reduced before a competition in
an attempt to peak performance at a target time (Thomas and Busso 2005)
• A time of reduced training volume and increased intensity that occurs before
a competition (McNeely and Sandler 2007)
Clearly, people respond to tapering in different ways, depending on their
individual profile of fatigue dissipation and fitness gain. Several factors require
consideration, although they may or may not affect taper design:
• Age and possibly gender of swimmer
• The events for which the swimmer is being prepared (distance specific or
stroke specific)
• The level at which the swimmer currently performs (for example, age group,
national, elite)
• Whether the swimmer will undertake a full or partial taper in preparation
for the targeted competition
Part of the art of coaching consists of manipulating training loads in the weeks
before competition (during overload and taper) in the optimal way for each
athlete. The remainder of this chapter offers a detailed look at how to optimize
the effects of tapering for a given swimmer within a seasonal, periodized model.
Tapering Models
The term taper is now well known by all who prepare elite athletes for competi-
tion, and people throughout the world use it in reference to the final training
phase leading up to a major race or competition event. But is everyone who speaks

of tapering talking about the same training concept? The scientific literature
indicates that they are not. Houmard (1991) clearly differentiated between the
concepts of reduced training and tapering. This author indicated that reduced
training occurs when training duration, frequency, intensity, or some combina-
tion of those elements is reduced by a constant degree. During tapering, on the
other hand, these variables are decreased in a systematic, nonlinear fashion.
Four training designs or tapering models have been described and used in
the past in an attempt to optimize sport performance, as shown in figure 10.1.
The training load during the taper is usually reduced in a progressive manner,
as implied by the term taper. This reduction can be carried out either linearly or
exponentially. As shown in figure 10.1, a linear taper usually implies a higher
total training load than an exponential taper. In addition, an exponential taper
can have either a slow or a fast time constant of decay; the training load is usu-
ally higher in the slow decay taper. Nonprogressive standardized reductions of
the training load have also been used (figure 10.1). This reduced training proce-
dure, which often maintains but may even improve many of the physiological
and performance adaptations gained with training (Mujika and Padilla 2003),
is also referred to as a step taper (Banister, Carter, and Zarkadas 1999; Mujika
1998; Zarkadas, Carter, and Banister 1995).
A study by Thomas and colleagues (2009) used a nonlinear mathematical
model to determine whether a two-phase taper is more effective than a simple
progressive taper. Reponses to training were simulated from the model param-
eters previously determined in competitive swimmers (Thomas, Mujika, and
Busso 2008). For each participant, the optimal progressive taper after a simulated

28-day overload training segment was compared with a two-phase taper of the
same duration and the same reduction in training load, except during the last
three days. In the final three days, the training load varied in a linear manner to
elicit the best possible individual performance. As the authors had hypothesized,
the highest performance was achieved after a moderate increase in the training
load during the last three days of the taper. The optimal variation in the train-
ing load during the final three days of the two-phase taper was an increase from
35 percent (plus or minus 32 percent) to 49 percent (plus or minus 46 percent)
of normal training in the swimmers (figure 10.2). Interestingly, for one of the
swimmers, the optimal training load continued to decrease during the last three
days of the two-phase taper, but it decreased less quickly than it did during the
first phase and during the linear taper. This observation is a clear indication
that not all athletes respond in the same manner to the training undertaken
during the taper, which emphasizes the necessity to individualize the tapering
strategies in accord with each athlete’s adaptation profile. The major finding of
the model study by Thomas and colleagues (2009) is that a moderate increase in
training during the last few days of the taper does not appear to be detrimental
to competition performance. A benefit of a two-phase taper could be expected
in comparison with a simple linear taper because of additional adaptations
that did not compromise the removal of fatigue. These findings should also
be considered when preparing for competitions consisting of multiple rounds
over several days, given that the successive qualifying rounds should increase
the training load in the lead-up to the final (Thomas, Mujika, and Busso 2009).

The Effect of Tapering on Performance 203
Performance Gains
Tapering-induced performance gains are usually in the range of 0.5 to 6.0 per-
cent for competition performance measures (table 10.1). In an observational
investigation on Olympic swimmers, Mujika, Padilla, and Pyne (2002) reported
on the performance change in 99 individual swimming events during the final
three weeks of training (generally coincident with the taper) in the lead-up to
the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. The overall performance change during the
three weeks for all swimmers was 2.18 percent (plus or minus 1.50 percent), with
a maximum loss of –1.14 percent and a maximum gain of 6.02 percent. Of the
99 performances analyzed, 91 were faster and only 8 were slower after the taper.

Performance improvements were not significantly different among events, and
they ranged from 0.64 percent (plus or minus 1.48 percent) in 400-meter freestyle
to 2.96 percent (plus or minus 1.08 percent) in 200-meter butterfly.
The 2.6 percent performance improvement attained during the taper by the
male swimmers in the study by Mujika, Padilla, and Pyne (2002) was somewhat
lower than some values previously published in the tapering literature. For
example, Costill and colleagues (1985) reported a mean performance improve-
ment of 3.1 percent as a result of a two-week taper in a group of 17 collegiate
male swimmers. Studying a similar population of 24 college male swimmers
tapering for two to three weeks, the same group of researchers observed a 3.2
percent gain in performance (Costill et al. 1991). Johns and colleagues (1992)
also reported an average performance improvement of 2.8 percent (plus or minus
0.3 percent) with a 10- to 14-day taper.
Performance improvement differences between the studies mentioned in the
previous paragraph and the study by Mujika, Padilla, and Pyne (2002) could be
partly attributable to the higher performance level of the swimmers analyzed
in the latter investigation. Indeed, some of the highest mean performance gains
with taper (7.96 and 5.00 percent in 100 meters and 400 meters, respectively)
have been reported in high school swimmers (D’Acquisto et al. 1992), whereas
values of 2.6 percent (Cavanaugh and Musch 1989) and 2.32 percent (plus or
minus 1.69 percent) (Mujika et al. 1996b) have been observed in national- and
international-level male swimmers during tapers lasting four weeks. Bonifazi,
Sardella, and Luppo (2000) analyzed the effects of a taper lasting two to three
weeks in international-level male swimmers during two consecutive seasons.
Performance improved by 1.48 percent during the first season and 2.07 percent
during the second. Taken together, the results of these investigations indicate
that the taper in international-level swimmers usually produces an average per-
formance gain in the range of 1.5 to 2.5 percent. The study by Mujika, Padilla,
and Pyne (2002) also evaluated performance improvement with the taper (final
three weeks of training) in males and females participating in events of vary-
ing distance and showed no significant difference between any of the analyzed
swimming distances, which suggests that the metabolic contribution to energy
provision during competition, which varies with racing distance, does not affect
the potential gain that can be obtained during a three-week taper. Similarly,
the comparison between freestyle and form (backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly,
and individual medley) events showed no differences in the magnitude of per-
formance improvement, suggesting that technical and biomechanical aspects
of competition do not necessarily affect the performance outcome of a taper.
In addition, performance change with the taper was not significantly different
among swimmers from the 14 countries represented in the sample, ranging from
0.13 percent (plus or minus 0.28 percent) for Nigerian swimmers to 3.98 percent
(plus or minus 2.18 percent) for swimmers representing Swaziland.
Performance improvements regardless of the specific event have been reported
by several authors. In male swimmers, Costill and colleagues (1985) observed

--- Page 216 Text ---

The Effect of Tapering on Performance 205
gains ranging from 2.2 percent in 100-yard (91 m) freestyle (n = 2) and 200-yard
(182 m) butterfly (n = 3), and 4.6 percent in 200-yard (182 m) individual medley
(n = 5). Johns and colleagues (1992) reported a minimum gain of 2.0 percent in
100-yard (91 m) breaststroke (n = 1) and a maximum gain of 3.7 percent in 100-
yard (91 m) (n = 5) and 200-yard (182 m) freestyle (n = 2). Similar values, from
2.0 percent (n = 6) to 3.8 percent (n = 4), were reported by Cavanaugh and Musch
(1989) for 50-yard freestyle and 200-yard (182 m) breaststroke, respectively.
All of these were similar to the 1.73 percent and 3.25 percent gains observed
in 50-meter (n = 4) and 200-meter freestyle (n = 6) respectively for males in
the study by Mujika, Padilla, and Pyne (2002). Again, these results support the
notion that tapering elicits a relatively consistent improvement across different
competitive swimming events.
Given the typical performance gains cited here, it is appropriate to look at
which aspects of the training program are manipulated during the taper to derive
such improvements. Of the variations in frequency, intensity, and volume (total
meters swum and dryland training) that can occur during taper, the evidence
is overwhelming that the key to performance gains is to maintain intensity (at
least) while undergoing some reduction in other aspects of the program.
Intensity
Numerous reviews highlight the importance of training intensity during a taper
(Houmard and Johns 1994; Kubukeli, Noakes, and Dennis 2002; Mujika 1998;
Neufer 1989). Such a finding is not just scientific rhetoric; it is also found in best
practice application by coaches. Mujika and colleagues (1996a) monitored weekly
swimming distance performed at various intensity levels by 18 national- and
international-caliber swimmers in the four weeks preceding the taper and during
each of the three tapers performed by the athletes during a season. As shown
in table 10.2, during the first taper of the season (which lasted three weeks),
the swimmers reduced their weekly distance swum at moderate and maximal
intensity. During the second taper (four weeks), weekly distances at all levels of
intensity were reduced. During the final taper (six weeks), only moderate- and
high-intensity swimming was reduced. Stewart and Hopkins (2000) provided
a detailed account of the training practices of 24 swim coaches and 185 sprint
(50- and 100-meter) and middle-distance (200- and 400-meter) swimmers
over a summer and winter season in New Zealand. Interval training intensity
and rest duration of interval workouts increased during the taper for sprinters
and middle-distance specialists, whereas interval distance decreased. In this
study, the authors noted that the average training program reflected principles
of specificity, particularly during the taper phase.
Volume

the taper was related to competition performance. Mujika et al. (1995) found
a reasonably positive relationship between percentage improvement in perfor-
mance during taper and percentage reduction in training volume during taper
(figure 10.3). Stewart and Hopkins (2000) found a similar result with reductions
in mean weekly volumes and session training volumes for sprint and middle-
distance swimmers as the taper progressed. The authors noted that substantial
reductions occurred in all measures of training distance (except easy swimming,
which actually increased when represented as a percentage of the total workout
during taper) from the start of the season (buildup phase) to the end of tapering
for both sprinters and middle-distance swimmers. Similar positive effects on
performance have been found in other studies of swimming, running, cycling,

Bosquet et al. (2007) conducted a meta-analysis of the influence of training
volume on taper-induced changes in swimming, running, and cycling (table
10.3). Bosquet and colleagues confirmed previous research in this area of the
positive performance effects of reduced training volume. With particular refer-
ence to swimming, such reductions appear to be optimized at about 41 to 60
percent of pretaper training values (figure 10.4). Such reductions appear consis-
tent with those found by Stewart and Hopkins (2000) and those suggested by
Houmard and Johns (1994) and Mujika and Padilla (2003).
Frequency
One area of prescription in which some discrepancy seems to occur between
studies is frequency. Moreover, variations in reported frequency of taper work-
outs appear to be related to the level at which the athlete competes (e.g., age

group or international level). Stewart and Hopkins (2000) reported little change
in training frequency (except during postcompetition phases) throughout the
season for sprint and middle-distance swimmers. Age of swimmer also played
little part in the training prescription; the authors noted that most coaches
simply grouped swimmers together by ability, regardless of age. The performance
of swimmers in this study was approximately 80 percent of world-record pace,
which is certainly not elite, but the swimmers were typically around 15 years
old. Whether the effects of reducing training frequency are any different in
more experienced athletes is not yet known, but after an inconclusive study of
the effects of differing training frequencies on performance in middle-distance
runners, Mujika et al. (2002a) concluded that athletes might have experienced
a loss of feel on a restricted training regime. If so, such a situation is likely to be
exacerbated in swimming given the higher degree of technicality required in that
sport (McNeely and Sandler 2007; Mujika and Padilla 2003) and the difficulty
in breaking a typically historical habit of double daily workouts on most days of
the week for most of the season (Costill et al. 1991; Stewart and Hopkins 2000).
According to Bosquet et al. (2007), decreased training frequency has shown
fairly insubstantial effects on swimming, running, and cycling performance
improvements (table 10.4). The authors did highlight that the effects of decreased
training frequency are partially related to training volume and intensity, which
makes it difficult to isolate the precise effect of a reduction in training frequency
on performance. In the study by Stewart and Hopkins (2000), the authors
conducted partial correlations for most of the training effects to account for
age of the swimmer. No such correlational studies have been conducted on the
intricate variations of the training prescription (intensity, rest intervals, volume,
frequency) on each other.
Duration
Working out the precise duration of taper for individual athletes has to be one
of the biggest challenges to coaches and scientists. Part of the consideration of
the optimal taper length for an individual athlete is the training status of the

athlete at the end of the phase just before tapering. Generally, we agree with the
suggestion of Kubukeli, Noakes, and Dennis (2002) that an athlete who ends
the high workload phase on the edge will require a longer taper than someone
who can still make further positive adaptation to overload. This suggestion has
been confirmed by a computer simulation study carried out by Thomas, Mujika,
and Busso (2008), who suggested that the training performed in the lead-up to
the taper greatly influences the optimal individual duration of the taper. A 20
percent increase over normal training during 28 days before the taper requires
a step reduction in training of about 65 percent during three weeks, instead of
two weeks when no overload training is performed. A progressive taper, however,
requires a smaller reduction of training over a longer duration than a step taper
does, whatever the pretaper training. The effect of the pretaper training on the
duration of the optimal taper seems obvious in regard to the reduction of the
accumulated fatigue.
Mujika and Padilla (2003) reported positive physical and psychological
effects of tapers that lasted from 10 days up to 5 weeks for swimmers. Note
that the taper is not just about preparing physically for the upcoming compe-
tition; the psychological aspect could be at least as important as the physical
preparation. Most coaches can recount anecdotes of swimmers who were
physically ready for the main competition but performed below expectations
because they were mentally unprepared (only to perform as expected, if not
better, in a minor competition when the pressure was off). On the flip side,
we are sure that in plenty of instances an athlete has been ready to perform a
few days before the main event but then was not be able to sustain or re-create
the focus for the big day.
Stewart and Hopkins (2000) reported on the typical length of taper over
consecutive summer and winter seasons for a large group of sprint-trained
(50 and 100 meters) and middle-distance trained swimmers in New Zealand.
The coaches of those swimmers reported typical taper durations of nearly four
weeks for sprinters and about one week less for middle-distance swimmers.
Detailed study by the authors of the training prescription in a specialty phase
before tapering indicated a less-than-optimal program of specificity leading into
the taper. As such, swimmers in that study may have derived further training
adaptations before tapering, which may have then affected the duration of the
taper undertaken. Without further detailed investigation, the optimum taper
duration for an individual athlete is still somewhat of a mystery.
Bosquet and colleagues (2007) found a dose-response relationship between
the duration of the taper and the improvement in performance (table 10.5 and
figure 10.5). A taper duration of 8 to 14 days was the borderline between the
positive influence of fatigue withdrawal and the negative influence of losing
adaptation (detraining). Although athletes could expect improvements in
performance following tapers lasting 1, 3, or 4 weeks, tapers of such duration
could possibly have a negative effect. Given that individual athletes vary in
physiological and psychological makeup, that such athletes respond differently
to different training programs, and that an overload phase may or may not be

used before tapering, several authors have concluded that the taper duration
must be individually determined for each athlete to optimize performance gains
(Bosquet et al. 2007; Mujika et al. 1996a).
Millet et al. (2005) used mathematical modeling to describe the relationships
between training loads and anxiety and perceived fatigue as a new method for
assessing the effects of training on the psychological status of the athletes. They
observed that the time for self-perceived fatigue to return to its baseline level was
15 days, which was close to the time modeled by previous researchers as optimal
for tapering (Busso, Candau, and Lacour 1994; Busso et al. 2002; Fitz-Clarke,
Morton, and Banister 1991). The authors of this investigation and other similar
studies concluded that the use of a simple questionnaire to assess anxiety and
perceived fatigue could also be used to adjust the optimal duration of tapering
(Chatard et al. 2003; Hooper and MacKinnon 1995; Hooper et al. 1995; Hooper,
MacKinnon, and Hanrahan 1997; Millet et al. 2005).

The Effect of Tapering on Performance 211
Pooling all the literature regarding the intensity, volume, frequency, and dura-
tion of the taper, the consensus appears to be that tapering for approximately
one to three weeks with a high-intensity, low-volume training program produces
the greatest contribution to performance. During the taper, maintenance of
training intensity appears to be necessary to avoid detraining, provided that
reductions in other training characteristics allow sufficient recovery to opti-
mize performance. But coaches and athletes should not use the taper as a time
to increase total sprinting distance in training. As other components of train-
ing load (particularly volume) are reduced, the absolute amount of sprinting
must also be reduced during the taper to allow time for recovery. The subtlety
in the art of effective tapering is that the percentage of total training volume
prescribed as high-intensity training may increase up to (but not beyond) some
critical threshold for the individual swimmer. The optimum shape of the taper
appears to be one in which overall training load is reduced in either a linear or
preferably an exponential pattern.
Prior Training
Strong evidence suggests that performance improves if high training loads are
prescribed for a period of one to three weeks just before the taper (Lehmann
et al. 1991, 1992; Morgan et al. 1987; Morgan and Costill 1987; Morgan et al.
1988; O’Connor et al. 1989; Raglin, Koceja, and Stager 1996; Ripol 1993; Snyder
et al. 1993). Although such training appears to have a positive influence (figures
10.6 through 10.9), it also engenders a state of fatigue that should such training
continue for too long, it would probably lead to a deterioration in performance,
longer-term fatigue, and potentially an inability to recover in time for competi-
tion (Bannister et al. 1975; Bannister and Calvert 1980; Bannister 1991; Boobis
1987; Calvert et al. 1976; Hultman et al. 1990; Karlsson et al. 1981; Morton, Fitz-
Clarke, and Banister 1990; Morton 1991; Mujika et al. 1996a; Stewart, Shearman,
and Hopkins 2000).
When an athlete starts to show signs of a plateau in adaptation or an adverse
change occurs in the psychology of the swimmer, the taper should commence. As
noted earlier, athletes respond to the taper in different ways and tapers do not work
the same way for all swimmers. Coaches and scientists need to work together to
determine the optimal type of taper and its duration for each swimmer. Although
logistics need to be considered (many athletes training at the same time under
the guidance of one or a small number of coaches), a well-designed overload
and taper phase could feasibly have different athletes being prescribed different
workouts at different times to account for different needs and adaptations.
A number of possible explanations may account the effect of tapering (figures
10.6 through 10.9). A high-load workout produces a greater training stimulus
than a low-load workout (Bannister et al. 1975; Bannister and Calvert 1980;
Bannister 1991; Calvert et al. 1976; Fitz-Clarke, Morton, and Banister 1991;
Morton, Fitz-Clarke, and Banister 1990; Morton 1991; Mujika et al. 1996a), but
hard training is accompanied by greater fatigue than the fatigue associated with

low- or moderate-intensity training (Bannister et al. 1975; Bannister 1991; Busso
et al. 1990; Calvert et al. 1976; Fry et al. 1992; Morton, Fitz-Clarke, and Banister
1990; Morton 1991). Evidence also shows that the greater fatigue associated
with high-intensity training decays at a much slower rate than the fatigue that
accompanies low-intensity training and that fatigue decays faster than fitness
(Bannister et al. 1975; Bannister 1991; Calvert et al. 1976; Fitz-Clarke, Morton,
and Banister 1991; Morton, Fitz-Clarke, and Banister 1990; Morton 1991;
Mujika et al. 1996a). Thus, the various taper models that have been described
previously are designed to maintain as much as possible the positive effects of
training while allowing fatigue to dissipate in time for competition. Optimal
performance is probably obtained when the difference between fitness and
fatigue is at a maximum (figure 10.10), when swimmers feel fresh and energized
and when they have mentally prepared for competition (Bannister and Calvert
1980; Colwin 1995; McNeely and Sandler 2007; Raglin, Koceja, and Stager 1996;
Wittig, Houmard, and Costill 1989).
In essence, a partnership of scientist, coach, and athlete is the best approach
to individualizing any given taper. The team may need to work together for years
before an athlete can be prepared optimally for the exact day of competition
when the peak performance is required. Over such time, some experimenta-

tion involving trial-and-error approaches will likely occur. Eventually, it will
be possible to work backward from the time of competition, knowing how long
the taper will be and how long the overload phase will be before the taper. The
combination of these two events will lead the coach–athlete–scientist team to
pinpoint to the day when the overload phase should begin as the final lead-in
preparation for competition.
Biological Source of Performance Gains
Now let’s look at some of the biological mechanisms that underpin the effects
of the taper. In this section we also present information and provide guidance
about what to look for to avoid adverse effects of training, particularly during
the overload and taper phases.
Cardiorespiratory System
Given the role that the cardiovascular and respiratory systems play during train-
ing, they should respond to tapered training with considerable structural and
functional changes despite the relatively short duration of the taper typically per-
formed by well-trained swimmers. The most widely used index of cardiovascular
.
and respiratory fitness is the maximal oxygen uptake, or VO. Research shows
. 2
that VO can increase or remain unchanged during tapering before competition
2
in highly trained athletes. In a study with high school swimmers who tapered
for either two or four weeks, both groups improved their swimming time-trial
.
performance by 4 to 8 percent, but VOmax was unchanged (D’Acquisto et al.
2 .
1992). Van Handel and colleagues (1988) also reported stable VOmax values

(65.4 pretaper versus 66.6 ml ∙ kg–1 ∙ min–1 posttaper) in college-aged swimmers

(including Olympic medal winners) who tapered for 20 days leading up to the
U.S. National Championships. Unfortunately, performance outcomes were not
reported in that investigation.
Improvements in economy of movement have also been reported in swim-
ming, but these gains appear to be inversely related to the caliber of the athletes.
High school male and female swimmers who tapered for 2 or 4 weeks showed
.
downward shifts in their VO–velocity curves (i.e., improved economy) of
2
between 4.9 and 15.6 percent and between 8.5 and 16.7 percent, respectively, at
a range of swimming velocities (D’Acquisto et al. 1992). The authors suggested
that changes in economy were dependent on reductions in training volume,
and they speculated that the taper had a beneficial effect on biomechanics,
allowing the swimmers to develop better stroke mechanics (D’Acquisto et al.
1992). Johns and colleagues (1992) also reported declines of 5 to 8 percent
in the oxygen cost of swimming after 10 or 14 days of taper in intercollegiate
swimmers. In contrast, Van Handel and colleagues (1988) failed to observe any
tapering-induced changes in the economy curves of swimmers of much higher
caliber, who were described as considerably more economical than less-skilled
swimmers.
Few reports are available on the effects of tapering on athletes’ resting heart
rate (HR), but the consensus of investigators is that resting HR does not appear
to change during this phase of training. Unchanged resting HR values were
observed by Flynn and colleagues (1994) before and after three weeks of taper in
collegiate swimmers (54 versus 55 beats per minute). In line with these results,
stable resting HRs were observed in a group of international-level swimmers
who tapered for two weeks (Hooper, Mackinnon, and Howard 1999).
Results from investigations that address the effects of taper on maximal HR
are not consistent, and values have variously been shown to decrease, remain
constant, or increase after a taper. For instance, D’Acquisto and colleagues (1992)
reported lower maximal HR in swimmers after tapers lasting two weeks (187
versus 192 beats per minute) or four weeks (185 versus 194 beats per minute). In
contrast, maximal HR increased slightly after two weeks of taper in Australian
swimmers (Hooper, Mackinnon, and Howard 1999).
Most of the available literature on the effects of the taper on submaximal
exercise HR indicates few changes. No change in HR was observed by D’Acquisto
and colleagues (1992) when swimmers were required to swim at submaximal
velocities ranging from 1.0 to 1.3 meters per second before and after two or four
weeks of taper. Costill and colleagues (1985) reported unchanged postexercise
HR after an evenly paced 200-yard (182 m) swim at a speed representing 90
percent of an individual season’s best performance after one and two weeks
of taper.
Published reports on the effects of a taper on resting blood pressure (BP)
failed to show any substantial effect of tapering on BP. Flynn and colleagues
(1994) reported pre- and posttaper systolic BP values of 118 and 116 millimeters
of mercury in five male swimmers. Diastolic pressures were 76 and 78 millimeters

of mercury for the swimmers. Hooper, Mackinnon, and Howard (1999) reported
modest declines of 3.4 and 2.2 percent in systolic and diastolic pressures during
the taper and standard deviations of 12.5 and 12.2 percent, respectively.
Red Blood Cells
The taper can be accompanied by a positive balance between exercise-induced
hemolysis and the recovery-facilitated generation of new red blood cells. Hemo-
globin concentration and hematocrit increased during the taper in competitive
swimmers (Burke et al. 1982a; Rushall and Busch 1980; Yamamoto, Mutoh, and
Miyashita 1988). These results were attributed to decreased hemolysis and a net
increase in erythrocytes, presumably facilitated by the reduced training load that
characterizes tapering (Houmard 1991; Houmard and Johns 1994; Mujika et al.
1998; Neufer 1989; Shepley et al. 1992).
With respect to the possible influence of the observed hematological changes
on performance, Mujika and colleagues (1998) observed a 2.3 percent mean
competition performance improvement in tapered swimmers, and they found a
positive correlation between posttaper red cell count and the percentage improve-
ment in performance attained by the swimmers during taper. Red cell count,
hemoglobin, and hematocrit increased by 3.5, 1.8, and 3.3 percent, respectively,
in the swimmers for whom the taper was most effective, whereas decreases of
2.2, 4.3, and 2.1 percent occurred in those athletes who improved less with the
taper. The authors suggested that the net increase in erythrocyte values observed
in the successful swimmers during the taper could have been in part responsible
for the higher performance improvement attained, given that small percentage
increases in hemoglobin or hematocrit values can result in worthwhile improve-
.
ments in VOmax and exercise capacity (Gledhill 1982, 1985).

Energy Metabolism
Energy metabolism underpinning exercise performance can be altered during a
preevent taper. Decreases in training load in favor of rest and recovery lower an
athlete’s daily energy expenditure, potentially affecting energy balance and body
composition. Substrate availability and utilization, blood lactate kinetics, muscle
glycogen content, and other metabolic variables may also be altered during the
taper.
D’Acquisto and colleagues (1992) reported the body mass and percent body fat
of female swimmers before and after two- and four-week tapers. These research-
ers observed that neither variable changed significantly. Additional studies have
reported stability in body mass in collegiate swimmers after a three-week taper
consisting of a 20 to 33 percent weekly reduction in training volume (Flynn et
al. 1994). Similarly, collegiate swimmers maintained their body mass during the
taper preparing for the final meet of the season (Van Handel et al. 1988). This
study, however, did not report the possible changes in fat mass and muscle mass
of the swimmers.

Along with the previously mentioned metabolic changes, blood lactate kinetics
may also be affected by a tapered training interval, during both maximal and
submaximal exercise. Peak blood lactate concentration after maximal exercise can
increase because of tapering. This change, which could be related to an increased
posttaper muscle glycogen concentration by a mass-action effect (Houmard et
al. 1994), might underpin enhanced maximal performance. Indeed, significant
relationships between increases in peak postrace blood lactate levels and com-
petition performance enhancement (r = 0.63) were seen in international-level
swimmers during two consecutive seasons (Bonifazi, Sardella, and Luppo 2000).
Competitive high school female swimmers increased their peak blood lactate
concentration by 20 percent after taper programs that induced time-trial perfor-
mance gains of 4 to 8 percent (D’Acquisto et al. 1992). Van Handel and colleagues
(1988) also showed modest changes in peak lactate concentrations in collegiate
swimmers preparing for national championships (6.9 to 7.5 mM). In contrast,
Papoti and colleagues (2007) reported statistically unchanged peak blood lactate
values in 16-year-old swimmers tapering for 11 days (peak blood lactate of 6.8
and 7.2 mM before and after the taper, respectively). These authors speculated
that the taper promoted intramuscular creatine phosphate supercompensation
(Papoti et al. 2007).
Blood lactate concentration at submaximal exercise intensity shows variable
responses after the taper. Kenitzer (1998) described a decrease in blood lactate
concentration at 80 percent of maximal HR during the first 2 weeks of a taper in
female swimmers but a subsequent increase during weeks 3 and 4, leading to the
tentative conclusion that 2 weeks was the optimum taper duration. In contrast,
D’Acquisto and colleagues (1992) observed reduced blood lactate values during
submaximal swimming in high school females who tapered for either 2 weeks
(15 to 26 percent decline) or 4 weeks (26 to 33 percent decline). These results are
consistent with those of Costill and colleagues (1985), who described a 13 percent
reduction in submaximal lactate, in parallel with a mean 3.1 percent swimming
performance improvement in competition after a 2-week taper. In contrast with
investigators who reported higher blood lactates, Johns and colleagues (1992)
failed to observe any change in blood lactate concentration in collegiate swim-
mers who tapered for either 10 or 14 days before a major competition (Johns et
al. 1992). Van Handel and colleagues (1988) reported a subtle shift of the blood
lactate–swimming velocity curve back to the left after taper. Inconsistent findings
may be related to the duration and type of training performed during the taper.
Muscle glycogen concentration has been shown to increase progressively
during tapering in cycling and running (Neary et al. 1992; Neary, Martin, and
Quinney 2003; Shepley et al. 1992; Walker et al. 2000), but no such studies are
available for swimming.
Biochemical Markers
Few biochemical parameters exhibit marked changes during the preevent taper,
limiting their utility as markers of physiological recovery and increased perfor-

mance capacity. One of the most widely used and studied biochemical mark-
ers of training stress is the concentration of creatine kinase (CK) in the blood.
Blood levels of CK have been used as an index of training-induced physiological
stress. CK is a muscle enzyme that occasionally increases in the blood follow-
ing strenuous or eccentric exercise, probably because of altered permeability of
tissue cell membranes. Factors that influence the degree of CK efflux into the
blood include exercise duration and intensity, exercise mode, and fitness level
of the individual (Millard et al. 1985). Various studies have shown decreases
in CK levels during the taper. After studying 10 male and 10 female collegiate
swimmers before and after a four-week taper, Millard et al. (1985) noted a 70
percent lower posttraining and a 30 percent lower resting serum CK after the
taper in the males and 28 and 7 percent lower values in the females. Absolute
posttaper CK values were not different between genders and fell to their lowest
levels of the season during the taper. These results suggested that CK levels reflect
training volume rather than intensity. Yamamoto, Mutoh, and Miyashita (1988)
also observed decreased CK levels after swimming tapers correlating with the
daily workout volume during the taper. Flynn and colleagues (1994) described
a CK reduction of 38 percent during three weeks of taper. Mujika and colleagues
(1996c) also reported a 43 percent decline in plasma CK during a four-week taper,
but this decline did not relate well with swimming performance improvements,
which ranged from 0.4 to 4.9 percent. Costill and colleagues (1991) measured
28 percent lower CK values after two to three weeks of taper, which resulted
in an average performance improvement of 3.2 percent. Burke and colleagues
(1982b) also observed a decline in CK levels after the taper in swimmers, but
their values remained in the high to normal range.
In contrast to studies that showed lower CK values after the taper, a study by
Hooper, Mackinnon, and Howard (1999) showed a statistically nonsignificant 17
percent increase in plasma CK during a two-week taper and large interindividual
variation among swimmers. These authors argued that plasma CK is not a reli-
able marker of training stress and reflects an acute response to a single exercise
session rather than an athlete’s homeostatic status. They also suggested that the
large interindividual variation could indicate large differences in athletes’ physi-
ological responses to the taper. The published literature appears to suggest that
plasma CK values could be of some interest to assess recovery from acute training
stress and muscle damage during the taper, but the validity of this parameter
as a marker of an individual athlete’s performance capabilities seems limited.
Costill and colleagues (1985) did not detect any taper-induced changes in
their swimmers’ blood pH, partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO ), partial
2
pressure of oxygen (PO ), bicarbonate (HCO), and base excess after a 200-yard
2 3
(183 m) submaximal swim at 90 percent of the season’s best performance.
Hormones
Strenuous physical exercise is known to result in short- and long-term altera-
tions of the endocrine system (Bunt 1986; Galbo 1986; Viru 1992). Because of

their responsiveness to training-induced physiological stress, various hormones
including testosterone, cortisol, catecholamines, growth hormone, and others
are often used as markers to monitor training stress, evaluate training responses,
and predict performance capacity. These hormonal markers of training stress
should therefore reflect the variations in the training load that take place during
different phases of a competitive season, such as during a taper, and hormonal
changes should be related to changes in competition performance.
The plasma levels of testosterone (T) and cortisol (C) could represent anabolic
and catabolic tissue activities, respectively. Although the T:C ratio has been sug-
gested as a marker of training stress (Adlercreutz et al. 1986; Kuoppasalmi and
Adlercreutz 1985), the available data in the literature concerning androgen and C
responses to tapering in swimmers are inconclusive. In a study of collegiate swim-
mers, Flynn and colleagues (1994) observed that total testosterone (TT) and free
testosterone (FT) returned toward baseline during the taper after showing blunted
values throughout the intensive training phases of the season. No changes were
noticed in the TT:C and FT:C ratios. Changes in TT and FT during training and
taper, but not in TT:C or FT:C ratios, paralleled changes in performance during
criterion swims (Flynn et al. 1994).
Mujika and colleagues assessed the effects of tapering on selected hormones
in swimmers (Mujika et al. 1996c). Plasma TT; non-SHBG-bound testosterone
(NSBT), which is the sum of FT and albumin-bound T representing the biologi-
cally active fraction of T (Cumming and Wall 1985; Manni, Partridge, and Cefalu
1985); C; TT:C; and NSBT:C remained stable during a four-week taper subsequent
to eight weeks of intensive training, despite large variations in training volume
(Mujika et al. 1996c). Nevertheless, the four weeks of taper resulted in a 2.3
percent improvement in competition performance, and percentage variations in
swimming performance during the taper correlated with changes in the TT:C (r
= 0.81) and NSBT:C (r = 0.76) ratios and with changes in NSBT concentration (r
= 0.71) (Mujika et al. 1996c).
Changes in resting cortisol concentration during the taper have been proposed
as a means of monitoring performance capacity in athletes. For instance, Mujika
and colleagues (1996) found slight reductions in resting cortisol concentrations in
swimmers who responded to a four-week taper by improving their performance
by more than 2 percent but a significant increase in cortisol in swimmers less
respondent to the same taper program, suggesting a relationship between resting
cortisol levels and the performance response to the taper. Collegiate swimmers’
resting cortisol values declined by 23 to 30 percent, their testosterone concentra-
tion increased by 22 percent during the first taper, and the athletes’ competition
performance improved by an average of 3.2 percent in two different two- to
three-week tapers within a season (Costill et al. 1991). On the other hand, no
changes in TT, C, or the TT:C ratio were observed during six weeks of progressive
increase and two weeks of gradual decrease in training volume in well-trained
swimmers (Tanaka et al. 1993). A follow-up investigation of elite swimmers over
two seasons showed that the 1.5 to 2.1 percent performance improvements during

--- Page 230 Text ---
|
The Effect of Tapering on Performance 219
the tapers before the major competitions of each season were positively related
to the corresponding 22 to 49 percent increases in postcompetition peak lactate
concentrations but negatively related (r = −0.66) to the 19 to 29 percent change
in resting precompetition plasma cortisol concentration (Bonifazi, Sardella, and
Luppo 2000). The conclusion of this study was that a low cortisol concentration
was a prerequisite for improved performance in events that rely largely on the
contribution of anaerobic metabolism to total energy supply (Bonifazi, Sardella,
and Luppo 2000). These findings indicate that a hormonal milieu propitious to
anabolic processes is necessary for optimum function of the glycolytic power
system and performance in middle-distance events.
Female collegiate swimmers’ salivary cortisol levels have been reported to
return to baseline values after four weeks of taper consisting of a progressive 63
percent reduction in training volume (O’Connor et al. 1989). A similar finding
was reported in male swimmers, whose salivary cortisol decreased marginally
by 4.8 percent during the taper to attain the lowest values of the entire training
season (Tharp and Barnes 1990). Other investigations, however, have reported
unchanged or slightly increased cortisol concentrations because of a taper in
swimmers (Mujika et al. 1996c). Plasma cortisol concentrations are subject to
various kinds of physiological and psychological stressors (McCarthy and Dale
1988, Stein, Keller, and Schleifer 1985), which could explain conflicting findings.
The physical stress produced by the pretaper intensive training could be replaced
in the posttaper condition by the psychological stress associated with the oncom-
ing major competition (Mujika, Chatard, and Geyssant 1996).
Plasma and urinary catecholamine concentrations have been measured as
a means to monitor training stress and identify overreaching or overtraining
in athletes. Hooper and colleagues (1993) reported that plasma noradrenaline
was higher during the taper in swimmers who were overtrained and failed to
improve their performance. In another study by the same group, a small change
in time-trial swimming performance during the taper was predicted by changes
in plasma noradrenaline concentration, which accounted for 82 percent of
the variance. The authors concluded that the change in plasma noradrenaline
concentration could be a useful marker for monitoring recovery associated
with the taper, but they acknowledged that the role of catecholamines in the
recovery phase after intense training is not well established and that the expense
and complexity associated with catecholamine measurements preclude its use
in routine screening of athletes during the taper (Hooper, Mackinnon, and
Howard 1999). Other investigators have also measured plasma adrenaline,
noradrenaline, and dopamine concentrations before and after taper in competi-
tive swimmers (Mujika et al. 1996c). The only noticeable change in this study
was a statistically nonsignificant 22 percent decrease in plasma noradrenaline
during the taper. But in contrast with the previously mentioned investigation,
this change did not correlate with the 2.3 percent gains in competition swim-
ming performance, which ranged between 0.4 and 4.9 percent (Mujika et al.
1996c).

220 Mujika and Stewart
Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), a polypeptide that plays an important
role in the regulation of somatic growth; metabolism; and cellular proliferation,
differentiation, and survival, has also been measured before and after taper
in athletes (Koziris et al. 1999). Nine male collegiate swimmers’ total serum
IGF-I increased progressively by 76 percent above baseline during four months
of intensive training, and these elevated values were maintained during four
weeks of tapering. The levels of free IGF-I increased by 77 to 102 percent at all
training measurements, including the taper. The levels of immunoreactive IGF
binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) were 30 percent higher after intensive training and
remained elevated during tapering. In contrast, IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-
1) declined to baseline values during tapering. Performance measures were not
reported, but the authors of the study suggested that the increased total and free
IGF-I and total IGFBP-3 could have played a role in the observed reductions in
skinfold measurements during the season (Koziris et al. 1999).
Other hormones have been suggested as markers of training stress and over-
training during tapering. To date, the relevant studies have yielded inconclusive
results about the usefulness of hormonal monitoring.
Neuromuscular System
The extraordinary plasticity of skeletal muscle tissue allows it to adapt to variable
levels of functional demands, neuromuscular activity, and hormonal signals
and reversibly change its functional characteristics and structural composi-
tion (Gordon and Pattullo 1993; Hoppeler 1986; Kannus et al. 1992; Saltin
and Gollnick 1983). A precompetition taper presumably reduces the demands
placed on the neuromuscular system compared with previous phases of a train-
ing program. Increased strength and power as a result of a taper have been a
common observation in swimming. Costill and colleagues (1985) were among
the first researchers to describe such gains. These authors described an 18 per-
cent improvement in swim bench power and a 25 percent gain in actual swim
power in a group of 17 collegiate swimmers who underwent a 2-week taper.
Swim power improvement correlated with a 3.1 percent competition performance
gain (r = 0.68). The reduced training may have allowed an increase in maximal
tension development through changes in the contractile mechanisms or neural
controls on fiber recruitment (Costill et al. 1985). In keeping with these results,
Johns and colleagues (1992) observed a 5 percent increase in tethered swim-
ming power and a 2.8 percent improvement in competition performance after
10 and 14 days of taper. National- and international-level swimmers’ isolated
mean arm and leg power has also been shown to increase during a 4-week
taper, especially during the initial 5 to 24 seconds of exercise (Cavanaugh and
Musch 1989). Competition performance improved by an average of 2.6 percent
during the taper. Raglin, Koceja, and Stager (1996) also reported gains during a
4- to 5-week taper in swimming peak power (16 percent) and mean power (20
percent). In addition, they observed a 23 percent gain in neuromuscular func-
tion, as determined with the soleus Hoffmann reflex, an indicator of the general

excitability of the -motoneuron pool. These changes correlated with changes
in power and were accompanied by a 2.0 percent improvement in competition
velocity. The authors concluded that neurological adaptations may have a role
in the performance gains that often follow the taper (Raglin, Koceja, and Stager
1996). Trappe, Costill, and Thomas (2001) noted a 7 to 20 percent increase in
swim bench muscle power, a 13 percent increase in swim power, and a 4 percent
enhancement in competition performance as a result of a 3-week taper in six
male collegiate swimmers. In keeping with these results, Papoti and colleagues
(2007) reported a 3.8 percent gain in swim force and a 1.6 percent gain in 200-
meter time-trial performance after an 11-day taper consisting of a 48 percent
reduction in weekly training volume. Swim force significantly correlated with
performance both before and after the taper.
Trinity and colleagues (2006) found that elite swimmers’ maximal arm power
increased 10 and 12 percent during a taper. These gains in power correlated with
performance gains of 4.4 and 4.7 percent. These authors observed that maximal
mechanical power displayed a biphasic response during the taper, such that
approximately 50, 5, and 45 percent of the total increase occurred during the
first, second, and third weeks of the taper, respectively. In this study, the biphasic
response was reported to be the most common response to the taper among indi-
vidual swimmers, although some subjects were early responders or late responders.
Prins and colleagues (1991) and Hooper, Mackinnon, and Howard (1999) reported
unchanged muscular force as a result of a taper, concluding that pretaper force
levels were not compromised by the training load undertaken by swimmers. Differ-
ences with studies reporting gains in force after a taper may relate to variations in
the caliber of the swimmers and the training and tapering programs undertaken.
The taper appears to affect muscle fiber in various ways. In male collegiate
swimmers, no changes in Type I muscle fiber diameter and cross-sectional area
of deltoid muscle samples were observed after a three-week taper. On the
other hand, Type IIa muscle fiber diameter increased by 11 percent and cross-
sectional area increased by 24 percent. Neuromuscular adaptations also occurred
at the single-fiber level after tapering; Trappe, Costill, and Thomas (2001)
observed 30 percent higher peak isometric force, 67 percent faster shortening
velocity, and 250 percent higher absolute fiber power in Type IIa muscle fibers.
Type I fibers also increased their shortening velocity by 32 percent. On average,
Type II fibers produced twice as much peak power as Type I fibers before the taper
and five times as much peak power after the taper. These observations led the
authors to suggest that changes in contractile properties may have been closely
related to the observed improvements in whole-muscle strength and power
measures after the taper (Trappe, Costill, and Thomas 2001). As concluded by
a review article on single-fiber studies and exercise training, the taper has rela-
tively little influence on the size and force characteristics of Type I muscle fibers,
but Type IIa fibers seem to be more responsive, showing enhanced contraction
performance, as a result of equal or increased cross-sectional area, and increased
force and power. In addition, adequate adjustments in training volume and

intensity seem to be necessary to elicit positive changes in single-fiber contrac-
tion velocity (Malisoux, Francaux, and Theisen 2007).
Psychology
Because competition performance is the result of a conscious effort (Noakes
2000), it would be a major oversight to ignore the paramount contribution of
psychological and motivational factors to posttaper athletic performance. The
optimization of an athlete’s physiological status resulting from a well-designed
tapering strategy is presumably accompanied by beneficial psychological changes,
including mood state, perception of effort, and quality of sleep. Mood states are
sensitive to variations in the training load undertaken by athletes (Morgan et
al. 1987), and alterations should be expected because of a taper when the train-
ing load is markedly reduced. Numerous authors have reported mood state
changes associated with a precompetition taper. Most of these reports indicate
that tapering induces positive changes in the athlete’s mood state, contributing
to enhanced performance measures.
Morgan and colleagues (1987) and Raglin, Morgan, and O’Connor (1991)
first described decreased global mood scores computed from the Profile of
Mood States (POMS) questionnaire in college swimmers who tapered for four
weeks. The decrease in global mood scores was associated with decreased levels
of perceived fatigue, depression, anger, and confusion. These changes were also
accompanied by increased levels of vigor. Morgan and colleagues also reported
that decreases in mood disturbance were related to reductions in the training
load. Identical effects were observed in males and females. Some athletes did not
respond to the taper, however, and no declines in tension scores were observed.
Values were higher in female athletes than in male athletes (Morgan et al. 1987;
Raglin, Morgan, and O’Connor 1991). In fact, tension was the only mood vari-
able that remained elevated above baseline following the taper. Elevated tension
probably reflects anxiety provoked by the anticipation of the pending major
championship (O’Connor et al. 1989). In contrast with the previously mentioned
findings, Taylor, Rogers, and Driver (1997) reported sex differences in tapering-
induced mood state alterations. Relatively small (1.3 percent) competition
performance gains attained by female swimmers during taper were presumably
related to a deterioration in mood state indicated by increases in tension–anxiety
(56 percent), depression−dejection (218 percent), and confusion–bewilderment
(86 percent) and a 20 percent decrease in vigor–activity ratings (Taylor, Rogers,
and Driver 1997). Flynn and colleagues (1994) reported a 17 percent reduction
in the global mood state of a group of male swimmers after a three-week taper.
A similar 16 percent decline in total mood disturbance was observed by Raglin,
Koceja, and Stager (1996) in 12 collegiate female swimmers who tapered for four
to five weeks. This decline correlated moderately with mean swimming power
(r = .34), which increased by 20 percent with the taper. Swimming velocity
in competition also improved by 2.0 percent. Hooper, Mackinnon, and Ginn
(1998) observed reduced tension, depression, and anger after one week of taper

The Effect of Tapering on Performance 223
in state-level swimmers and a 10 percent lower total mood disturbance after two
weeks, which resulted in marginal time-trial performance gains of 0.2 percent
in 100-meter events and 0.7 percent in 400-meter events. But in a subsequent
investigation of international-caliber swimmers, these authors did not detect
any change in the total mood disturbance after a two-week taper (Hooper,
Mackinnon, and Howard 1999). In another study, young competitive swimmers
showed an acute decrease in total mood disturbance after practices that were
shorter in duration than usual during a precompetition week of taper. These
competitive swimmers reported short-term mood benefits including decreases
in scores of depression, confusion, and tension. But these acute mood benefits
during training before competition did not appear to be related to subsequent
performance in competition (Berger et al. 1997).
A fatigued and overstressed athlete perceives a given training load as a heavy
burden. In contrast, a fresh, well-recovered athlete may perceive a similar train-
ing load as light and easy. How athletes perceive a given training bout is their
perception of effort. The perception of effort during exercise is influenced by
a number of physiological and psychological variables (Borg, Hassmen, and
Lagerstrom 1987; Noble and Robertson 2000; Watt and Grove 1993), some of
which are presumably affected by a taper. The most widely used measure of
effort perception is Borg’s rating of perceived exertion (RPE) (Borg 1970, 1982),
which has been shown to change as a result of tapered training. The perception
of effort decreased in swimmers of both genders after a four-week taper in col-
legiate athletes (Morgan et al. 1987). Flynn and colleagues (1994) reported that
.
participants’ RPE while they swam at 90 percent of preseason VOmax decreased
2
from an average value of 14 (somewhat hard to hard) after two weeks of hard
training to 9 (very light) at the end of the taper.
Sleep
Sleep is a compensatory mechanism following catabolic processes of daytime
activity, and sleep disturbance is often associated with excessive training loads
and overtraining, defined as “an imbalance between training and recovery,
exercise and exercise capacity, stress and stress tolerance” (Lehmann, Foster, and
Keul 1993, p. 854). Given that tapering strategies are characterized by reduced
training loads, it seems plausible that sleep quality could also be affected by the
taper. The most in-depth investigation dealing with sleep patterns during taper-
ing in athletes indicates that sleep-onset latency, time awake after sleep onset,
total sleep time, and rapid eye movement sleep time were unchanged during
the taper in female swimmers. On the other hand, slow-wave sleep, which rep-
resented 31 percent of total sleep time during peak training, was reduced to 16
percent following the taper, suggesting that the need for restorative slow-wave
sleep declines with reduced physical demand. The number of movements during
sleep fell by 37 percent after the taper, indicating less sleep disruption in com-
parison with previous times of higher training loads (Taylor, Rogers, and Driver
1997). Hooper, Mackinnon, and Howard (1999) reported a slightly improved

quality of sleep in seven highly competitive female swimmers after two weeks
of tapering for the Australian National Championships.
Compliance
One final aspect to consider in all that we have discussed and presented in this
chapter is that of compliance. By compliance, we mean swimmers’ compliance
with training prescriptions and coaches’ compliance with scientific interventions.
With regard to the former, only large changes in competition performance can be
predicted using physiologic monitoring and training prescription (Anderson et al.
2006, 2008; Mujika et al. 1995; Pelayo et al. 1996; Pyne, Mujika, and Reilly 2009;
Stewart and Hopkins 2000). Furthermore, swimmers appear to adhere closely to
all aspects of training load except the most crucial component—intensity (Stewart
and Hopkins 1997). Coaches should therefore closely monitor the compliance
of their swimmers to the training prescription. An example of the influence of
compliance on performance outcome was found by Stewart, McGowan, and Park
(2002), who followed the performances of 25 age-group swimmers (ranging from
14 to 17 years old and achieving seasonal best performances of about 80 percent
of world-record pace) over several seasons. The authors concluded that there may
be an additional positive effect (about 1 to 1.5 percent) of tapering for swimmers
who comply strongly to the training prescription throughout the season as opposed
to those who comply moderately or poorly. Although such preliminary results
appear promising, coaches have yet to adopt the kind of year-round, high-intensity
approach that was used in this setting, so results have yet to be rigorously verified.
Summary
The taper is a phase of reduced training that usually follows a lengthy period
of progressive overload training to fine-tune the swimmer in preparation for
competition. This chapter provides practitioners with current information on
how to optimize the effects of tapering for a given swimmer within a seasonal,
periodized model. Progressive reductions of the training load during the taper
seem to be more beneficial than constant step reductions, but a final increase
in training for a few days prior to the big event may allow the athlete to benefit
from additional fitness adaptations.
An elite swimmer’s performance usually improves by about 2 to 3 percent
during the taper, provided that training intensity and frequency remain high,
but volume drops by about 41 to 60 percent compared to the previous loading
phase. Optimal taper duration often ranges from 8 to 21 days, depending on
previous training loads and individual adaptation profiles.
The mechanisms underpinning the beneficial effects of the taper can be of a
cardiovascular hematologic, metabolic, biochemical, hormonal, neuromuscular,
or psychological origin. For these benefits to be obtained, it is important that
swimmers comply with training prescriptions and coaches comply with scien-
tifically proven training interventions.

CHAPTER
Competition-Day
Strategies
—Scott Riewald, PhD, CSCS
Competition day is the day that every swimmer trains for. Although many
swimmers and coaches place a tremendous amount of focus on what hap-
pens on race day, the hay is largely already in the barn, so to speak, and the meet
is just where everything comes together to produce the ultimate performance.
All the physical training, strength and conditioning, fueling and nutrition, and
mental preparation done over the preceding months are directed at performing
on this big day. Still, the swimmer and coach need to do some things on race
day to make sure that everything comes together and plays out as planned.
Although what a swimmer does on race day may not make it possible to win
a race, doing the wrong thing can derail a performance. The meet represents
an opportunity to put the finishing touches on a swimmer’s preparation and
performance, yet these things do not come together by chance. Planning and
developing race-day strategies are needed to provide swimmers with the greatest
opportunity for success. This chapter looks at competition day and identifies
strategies that swimmers can use to finish their preparation and set themselves
up to achieve their peak performances.
Another important consideration is how swimmers recover, or bounce back,
between events at a competition. Most swimmers compete in multiple events
in a day. Even in the best scenario, when everything goes well and best times
are swum, swimmers and coaches need to consider what needs to be done to
get ready for the next race. When things don’t go as planned, it is even more
important for a swimmer to have a strategy to get back on track for the next race.
Not everything goes perfectly in every race, so the swimmer needs to know how
to learn from that race and move on to achieve a great performance in the next
swim. Swimmers often turn in poor performances, even in the Olympic Games,
only to come back and swim a best time (and in some instances win a medal)

in the next race. It is all about having a practiced strategy that will prepare a
swimmer to perform at her best each time she steps on the blocks.
In this chapter we draw on information presented elsewhere in the book and
relate it to performance on race day. Specifically, we discuss the following:
• Warm-up and cool-down
• Race-day nutrition
• Mental preparation for competition
• Recovery
• Communication and teamwork
The number one rule for swimmers and coaches on race day is “Don’t do
anything new at a competition.” They should stick with the strategies that they
know work and lead to the best performances. The state championship is not
the time to try massage if the swimmer has not had massage as part of his regu-
lar training and recovery protocol throughout the year. Nor is the big meet the
time to try that new energy drink that all the other swimmers seem to be using.
Without having tried it in practice or knowing how the body will react, doing
anything different nutritionally at a meet is like playing with fire.
Ultimately, race-day preparation boils down to developing a series of checklists
that, if followed, will set up a swimmer to achieve a peak performance. Let’s go
through the elements of a race day and discuss how to approach each one to
enhance performance, starting with the warm-up and cool-down.
Warm-Up and Cool-Down
The warm-up and cool-down are closely related. Although separated by a consid-
erable time at a competition, both deal with the same thing—preparation. The
warm-up prepares the body to race and perform at a high level. The cool-down
starts the recovery process and is essential for preparing the body for the next race.
Although the warm-up and cool-down are critical components of any training
or competition session, swimmers often do not do enough in these areas, nor
do they typically develop the consistency and discipline needed in these areas
to have a strategic effect on performance.
Warming Up
The purpose of the warm-up is literally to warm the body by increasing muscle
and core body temperature. When the body is warm, the muscles are able to
function more efficiently by contracting with greater force through a greater
range of motion. A good warm-up also does other things to get the body physi-
cally ready for high-intensity swimming (Jeffreys 2008; Salo and Riewald 2008).
Specifically, the warm-up
• primes the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, enhancing the body’s
ability to pump blood and deliver oxygen to the working muscles;

--- Page 238 Text ---
|
Competition-Day Strategies 227
• develops dynamic flexibility, or flexibility with motion, actively putting
muscles and joints through their range of motion, enhancing flexibility
and improving stroke efficiency;
• gets the body’s biochemistry working optimally—all of the body’s physi-
ological systems need to be warmed up to optimal levels to support high-
intensity swimming;
• gets the mind talking to the muscles, improving coordination and efficiency
of movement; and
• provides a checkpoint at which the swimmer and coach can evaluate the
state of the swimmer and her performance.
Many coaches make the warm-up a designed set and use the same warm-up
for every practice and competition with only slight variations. By doing the
same warm-up every day, the coach has 15 to 20 minutes to assess the physical
and mental state of the team. Although always doing the same warm-up may
seem boring, swimmers and coaches can readily relate what they are seeing or
feeling in the water and compare it with what they’ve experienced nearly every
day in practice. By doing a consistent warm-up, swimmers also learn to prepare
the body the same way before each practice and competition. Swimmers can
use this time to conduct their own assessments of what and how they are feel-
ing because they know that the training intensity will go up when the warm-up
is over. The warm-up should be part of an established routine that swimmers
know will prepare them to swim fast.
Data from warm-ups can be extremely valuable and powerful in the hands of
a seasoned coach. Being able to draw from days, weeks, even months of warm-up
performance data can provide tangible benefits on race day. If something seems
off on race day, the warm-up or other aspects of the athlete’s preparation can
be adjusted to accommodate the observed differences. Perhaps the swimmer
needs to spend more time getting loose or needs to perform a few extra higher-
intensity swims to get the body ready to go. Regardless, when the swimmer is
able to compare what is happening on race day with previous experiences, the
chance of dialing in performance is improved.
In-Water Warm-Up
Although there is no specific recipe for what makes an effective warm-up, most
warm-ups incorporate some level of moderate swimming (maybe 400 to 800
meters) that can include stroke drills and kicking as well as swimming, several
higher-intensity intervals (100 or 50 seconds) in which the swimmer integrates
stroke work and prepares to race, and some all-out sprints or race-specific pace
work. These higher-intensity efforts are followed by several hundred meters of
a lower-intensity cool-down.
Competitions present additional challenges to swimmers and coaches because
athletes often have to warm up multiple times during a day, once at the start of
the session and again before each swim. When facing this scenario, swimmers

--- Page 239 Text ---
}
228 Riewald
should do their main warm-up before the first swim and then use shorter warm-
ups before subsequent swims. The duration of these secondary warm-ups can
be shorter but should still follow the same general principles: start with easy
swimming and then use higher-intensity swims to elevate the heart rate and
warm the body.
Swimmer should follow some general preevent warm-up guidelines:
• Finish the main warm-up at least 30 minutes before the race.
• If possible, get back in the water 10 to 15 minutes before the race.
• Use mostly moderate-intensity swimming at 50 to 65 percent effort.
• Gauge the intensity of effort while warming up before an event. Swim hard
enough to warm the body but not so hard that fatigue sets in before step-
ping on the blocks.
• Finish the preevent warm-up as close to the start of the event as possible,
ideally within 5 minutes of when the race is set to begin.
Dryland Warm-Up
Everything discussed so far has centered on performing an in-water warm-up.
But when pool space at a competition is limited or no warm-up pool is available,
coaches and swimmers may opt for a dryland warm-up. Although a dryland
warm-up is not ideal, it can help swimmers prepare physically for a race. Like the
in-water warm-up, the dryland warm-up should have two main components: a
general warm-up and a dynamic warm-up (Jeffreys 2008; Salo and Riewald 2008).
The general warm-up should be a moderate-intensity activity that uses many
of the large-muscle groups in the body to elevate body temperature. Examples
include light jogging, riding a stationary bicycle, and jumping rope. The general
warm-up should last 5 to 10 minutes or until the athlete breaks into a light sweat.
Dynamic warm-up exercises involve movement and are designed to improve
dynamic flexibility while keeping body temperature elevated. Exercises should
target the specific muscle groups used in swimming. Each exercise should be
performed for 15 to 30 seconds. The total dynamic warm-up should take 5 to 10
minutes to complete. Elastic tubing can be used to help with dynamic exercises,
which can be tweaked into swimming-specific drills that enhance the entire
dryland warm-up process. These drills should be planned and practiced.
This approach will help accomplish all warm-up goals and prepare the body
for swimming fast. The only difference between this and a traditional swimming
warm-up is that it is not done in the pool.
Mental Preparation During the Warm-Up
The warm-up helps swimmers prepare physically, but it should also help them
prepare mentally. Many sport psychologists emphasize the importance of devel-
oping a prepractice or prerace routine that includes a consistent warm-up. This
is another reason that swimmers should complete the same warm-up every day.

--- Page 240 Text ---
|
Competition-Day Strategies 229
A consistent warm-up also helps to equalize the importance that a swimmer
places on different competitions. Each level of competition carries a different
level of anxiety. Swimmers may feel OK preparing for a local or regional meet,
but what happens when they get to the pool for the state championships or
nationals? Ideally, swimmers want to enter each race with the same level of
focus, preparation, and comfort, knowing that they’ve done everything right in
preparing for the race. Changing a precompetition routine and altering what the
swimmer has always done to get ready for a race can add anxiety to a competi-
tion. Using a consistent warm-up tells the body, “We’ve been here before and
we know this is what it takes to swim fast.” More information on developing a
precompetition routine is presented later in the chapter.
Cooling Down
Coaches agree, and exercise physiologists confirm, that the cool-down is an
important component to swim training. But few coaches include enough cool-
down time in training sessions and even fewer mandate adequate cool-down
following a race. In fact, testing of elite swimmers by USA Swimming shows
that most swimmers cool down 40 percent of what they should before they get
out of the pool at a competition. The cool-down should be seen as step number
one in the recovery process to get the swimmer ready for the next race or the
next day of competition.
Understanding the physiological processes that occur with the cool-down
may shed light on its importance. In basic terms, the cool-down brings the body
back down to a normal level and begins the recovery process, setting the stage
to be able to perform at a high level in the next practice or race. As discussed
in chapter 8, during a race the body relies heavily on the anaerobic system to
provide the energy needed to drive performance. The anaerobic energy system
is capable of supplying muscles with a great deal of energy in the form of ATP
very quickly, but it also produces lactic acid and lactate that should be cleared
before the next high-intensity effort if peak performance is desired.
Cooling down allows the body to return to a more normal state. The amount
of lactate produced following a practice or a race can be measured, although
doing so is impractical in most cases. Fortunately, USA Swimming has conducted
some research in the area of lactate clearance and cooling down and has provided
recommendations that swimmers can follow to enhance recovery (Sokolovas
2003). Typically, lactate concentration rises over the first several minutes after a
race. Then, over the next 20 to 30 minutes, this concentration declines to near
baseline or prerace levels. From the research that has been conducted, four
observations have been made about the rate at which lactate is produced and
subsequently cleared from the body:
1. The intensity of swimming primarily determines how high the blood lactate
concentration will rise. In turn, this level affects the rate at which the blood
lactate concentration returns to normal resting values. Sprinters who have a

--- Page 241 Text ---
}
230 Riewald
high concentration of fast-twitch, power-generating muscle fibers produce
higher lactate concentrations than endurance swimmers do, and they need
more time to clear lactate from their bodies.
2. With all else equal, the lactate concentration will rise higher and decline
faster in a better-conditioned swimmer than in a less-conditioned swimmer.
3. Swimmers who perform a cool-down after racing increase the rate at which
the blood lactate returns to normal resting values.
4. Older swimmers take longer to clear lactate and require a longer cool-down
than younger swimmers. Masters swimmers, for example, could likely avoid
muscular discomfort in the days following an exceptionally hard training
session or intense competition by performing a longer cool-down.
Taking this information into account, additional guidelines on structur-
ing a proper cool-down have been developed. In general, a proper cool-down
should consist of at least 15 minutes of moderately paced swimming; cooling
down even longer is usually better. In fact, information from USA Swimming
suggests that the shorter the event is, the longer a swimmer should cool down
(Sokolovas 2003):
• For 50- and 100-meter races, swimmers should cool down for 25 to 30
minutes at an intensity that keeps the heart rate at approximately 120 to
130 beats per minute (20 or 21 beats in 10 seconds).
• For 200- and 400-meter races, swimmers should cool down for 15 to 20
minutes, maintaining a heart rate of 130 to 140 beats per minute (21 to 23
beats in 10 seconds).
• For races longer than 400 meters, swimmers should cool down for 10 to
15 minutes, maintaining a heart rate of 140 to 150 beats per minute (23 to
25 beats in 10 seconds).
These guidelines are useful in shaping a cool-down. Remember that all swim-
mers are different and that their experiences may differ from what an average
swimmer experiences, so these recommendations may need to be adjusted
accordingly.
The cool-down guidelines presented encourage an active cool-down, or per-
forming an actual activity to cool down. In general, the body removes lactate
most efficiently when the swimmer cools down by swimming at 55 to 65 per-
cent of maximum velocity. Recovery will occur even if a swimmer is not able
to do anything after the race. This is termed passive recovery, meaning that the
swimmer doesn’t need to do anything for it to occur. Knowing that the body
will be recovering as the swimmer rides home after the meet is reassuring, but
passive recovery occurs much more slowly than active recovery does. The rate
of recovery may not be important for swimmers who only swim one event per
day, but many swimmers compete in multiple events per session and repeat that
routine for several days in a row. For those swimmers in particular, an active
cool-down is critically important.

--- Page 242 Text ---
|
Competition-Day Strategies 231
Again, swim meets present some potentially complicating circumstances relat-
ing to a cool-down. What happens when an athlete swims multiple events per
day or does not have access to a cool-down pool? If possible, swimmers should
cool down after every race if they want to swim their best the next time they step
on the blocks. Even if only a short time is scheduled between swims, getting in
the pool immediately after a race will help with recovery. Unlike the warm-up
when swimmers can get by with doing less after they have gone through the
main warm-up at the start of the day, the cool-down may need to be longer with
each event that swimmers compete in.
If a cool-down pool is not available, the swimmer should engage in some
type of moderate-intensity active cool-down such as light jogging or riding a
stationary bike. Maintaining an intensity of 55 to 65 percent of the swimmer’s
maximal effort should adequately facilitate the recovery process without caus-
ing undue fatigue. Stretching has even been shown to be an acceptable form of
cooling down if the swimmer does not have access to a pool or other activity.
The take-home message is that the body recovers more quickly if the athlete
engages in some sort of moderate-intensity activity rather than passively sitting
and waiting for the recovery process to happen.
Mental Preparation and the Prerace Routine
Competition provides athletes the opportunity to demonstrate their abilities
and to challenge themselves as to how fast and how well they can swim. The
opportunity to compete is one of the reasons that swimmers train hard every
day. When standing on the blocks waiting for the gun to go off, it all boils down
to what the swimmer’s body can do, right?
Although physical ability is one factor that contributes to performance, mental
strength and conditioning are important as well. How athletes train mentally
and what they do to prepare for the specific race has a lot to do with the eventual
outcome. Swimmers need to be purposeful about preparing both their minds
and their bodies for competition.
Just as scientists have identified physical, physiological, and technical profiles
of elite athletes, similar work has been done to identify psychological profiles and
characteristics. This research has identified a number of psychological attributes
related to success. One of the key characteristics of top performers is having a
well-developed precompetition routine. Combined with high levels of motiva-
tion and commitment, coping skills, self-confidence, and arousal management
skills, having a precompetition routine helps athletes achieve higher levels of
performance.
After the 1996 Olympics, researchers identified factors that had positive and
negative effects on performance at the Games. One of the findings that distin-
guished athletes who performed well from those who didn’t was the development
of and adherence to physical and mental preparation plans. Successful athletes
had a precompetition routine that they developed, practiced, and stuck to even
at the biggest competitions (Gould and Dieffenbach 2002).

--- Page 243 Text ---
}
232 Riewald
In 1998, 10 athletes from the U.S. World Championships swim team were
interviewed to uncover how they approached and dealt with the mental aspect
of swimming. In particular, the athletes were asked to describe how they got
ready to race. Although they prepared for their races differently, all the athletes
had a routine or plan to get mentally ready to race (Riewald 2002).
Although the benefits of mental training and the development of a toolbox of
mental skills is discussed in detail in chapter 16, it is helpful here to highlight the
reasons why and how a prerace routine can influence performance. Following a
consistent and practiced routine will help athletes achieve the following goals.
Attain an Ideal State or Zone
The primary benefit or purpose of a mental preparation plan is to get the athlete
in a mental state that seems to relate to successful performance. The process that
the swimmer goes through to get there will be unique to the individual.
Achieve Greater Self-Confidence
Success breeds confidence. When athletes are able to see and feel past and future
successes as part of their mental preparation, confidence is not far behind. Imag-
ing a successful upcoming race is the dress rehearsal to the real deal. Visualizing
a great performance enhances the athlete’s belief that he can really do it.
Gain Greater Control of Mental Energy
Swimmers need to manage mental energy so that they are neither too flat nor too
amped up before racing. The goal is to get into that ideal state. During prepara-
tion, athletes may listen to certain songs to increase energy and put them into
the proper racing state. Alternatively, they may visualize a relaxing scene to slow
their hurrying thoughts. Such strategies can be a purposeful part of a mental
routine to manage mental energy.
Give More Effective Focus
A mental preparation routine can help swimmers focus on important aspects of their
performance. Technical cues (“explode off the blocks” or “hold your streamline”)
or images (“torpedo”) can be integrated into preparation to direct attention where
it needs to be as opposed to having the focus on unproductive or negative things.
Provide Comfort in Structure
A mental routine can be a security blanket, something to turn to in the stressful
moments leading up to the competition. Swimmers can use their mental rou-
tine to bring consistency to their preparation and performance, whether they
are swimming in a dual meet or at Olympic Trials. To some degree, a mental
preparation routine can take the environment out of the performance.

Competition-Day Strategies 233
Engage the Mind
The mind is a valuable commodity. When purposefully recruited and engaged,
the athlete has the additional support of positive emotions, feelings, and
thoughts. Athletes should make wise use of all the resources at their disposal as
they prepare for competition.
Coaches can do certain things to help their swimmers develop and strengthen
effective prerace routines. Coaches should talk to their swimmers about what
mental preparation is and why they should have a mental plan. Coaches need to
define some of the key components that make up a mental plan, such as imagery,
goal setting, self-talk, concentration, and energy management, and explain that
there is no right or wrong way to create a mental plan. Each swimmer will have
a personal, unique mental plan.
Next, the coach should have the swimmers reflect on past performances to
begin to understand how they feel when they perform well and what they need
to do to ensure good performances. Additionally, they should examine how
they feel when they do not perform well and identify what they need to do to
get out of that state.
Coaches should have the athletes create a mental plan, write the plan down,
and refer to it throughout the season. Coaches must provide opportunities and
encouragement to practice the plans. For example, a coach might set up a swim
practice before a big meet and have the swimmers run through their prerace
routines, giving them a chance to do their own premeet warm-up. This approach
allows the athletes to take ownership of their prerace readiness routines and
make changes if needed.
Although these things may seem insignificant when taken individually, con-
sider what it is that distinguishes the gold medal winner from the athlete who won
the silver, the third-place finisher from those who did not win a medal. It often
boils down to how the athletes prepared for the competition. The best athletes
in the world have strategies that help them perform to their utmost ability, and
they think about those points as they prepare for competition. Swimmers who
do the same will see their athletic performances improve.
Race-Day Nutrition
Nutrition for performance does not end when the competition starts. The swim-
mer can do a number of things to improve performance by planning nutrition
on race day.
Again, the key word is planning. Even the most nutritionally focused swim-
mers find challenges at competitions, particularly if they are traveling to attend
the meet. But by thinking through nutritional obstacles before stepping on the
pool deck, swimmers can make decisions that will enhance performance rather
than detract from it.
Swimmers should never enter a swim meet with the expectation that the
competition snack bar will provide them with the fuel they need to perform at

--- Page 245 Text ---

234 Riewald
their best. Athletes need to bring any foods they need to stay fueled and hydrated
throughout the competition. They need to think about how long the meet will
last, how much time will be scheduled between events, what foods they will need
to keep energy levels up during a long day of swimming, and so on. Swimmers
can develop nutritional checklists to make sure they have thought through all
their nutritional needs for race day. The bottom line is that swimmers should
plan to bring their own food to swim meets. An example of a nutrition checklist
is presented in table 11.1.
Swimmers should follow some general guidelines on competition days about
when they should consume meals and what should make up those meals, start-
ing with the precompetition meal. The focus of this meal should be to top off
carbohydrate and glycogen stores and hydrate the body. At the meet, the goal
should be to maintain energy and hydration levels by consuming small amounts
of nutrients, primarily carbohydrate and fluids, throughout the day (Burke 2000).
Athletes should consume a low-fat, high-carbohydrate meal composed mainly
of low to moderate glycemic index (GI) carbohydrate several hours before the first
race. Athletes should consume foods they are comfortable with. If nervousness
interferes with an athlete’s ability to consume solid food, liquid meal supple-
ments or smoothies are a suitable alternative.
An athlete who has two or more hours between races should consume a small
meal made up of high glycemic index carbohydrate to replenish glycogen stores
rapidly. An athlete who has less than two hours between races should be encour-
aged to eat a small snack made up of low GI food choices to avoid a sugar high
and the subsequent crash.
Athletes should continue to drink fluids regularly throughout the day to avoid
dehydration. They should replace lost fluids with water or sports drinks and stay
away from things like sodas and energy drinks.
Athletes should not try any new foods at a competition. Swimmers should
stick with foods that they have trialed at previous competitions or in practices
and go with what they know works. The body can respond in unexpected ways
when foods are tested for the first time on race day.
Just as a cool-down sets the stage for the next race, the same applies to nutri-
tion; what happens nutritionally after a race or competition session is just as

Competition-Day Strategies 235
important as what happened during or before it. Recovery is key, and the sooner
that swimmers start the recovery process, the better off they will be entering the
next race. Chapter 14 provides detailed information about recovery nutrition.
Swimmers need to get carbohydrate and some protein into the body as soon as
possible after a training or competition session ends. Additionally, fluid losses
should be replenished immediately. Ideally, everything during competition
should be an extension of what is done every day in training. Competition fueling
should be part of the routine, not a new experiment! If done properly, race-day
nutritional strategies can provide swimmers with a competitive advantage over
their competitors.
Communication Plan With Parents,
Coaches, and Teammates
The idea may sound silly, but one aspect of race day that can negatively influence
a swimmer’s performance is not having predefined communication strategies
that outline how that athlete will interact with parents, coaches, and even other
athletes during and after competition. Both sides in each of these relationships
need to have a clear understanding of the expectations for talking after a race
and the topics that are off limits.
Coach and Athlete
Athletes need to meet with the coach shortly after a race is completed so that the
two parties can discuss what went well and what the swimmer can work on in the
next race. If this debriefing is part of the team’s culture, the coach should clearly
communicate that she expects to speak with each athlete within a set time after
a race is completed. The coach should outline the topics to be discussed during
this review period, such as splits, race strategy, and strengths or weaknesses.
With that said, some flexibility should be allowed given the unique attributes
of each athlete. If an athlete prefers to reflect on the race for a while before
speaking with the coach and that postponement in turn leads to more produc-
tive discussions and the athlete’s taking increasing accountability for his swims,
the coach should probably think about letting things play out that way. The
coach also needs to know the personality of each athlete on the team and tailor
feedback appropriately to elicit a positive response that will lead to improved
performances in the next swim.
Athlete and Parent
All parents want to talk with their sons or daughters immediately after races and
tell them all the good and bad things they saw from the stands. Although this
practice may be OK following a good swim, these immediate discussions may
spiral out of control if the athlete’s performance was disappointing. Athletes

--- Page 247 Text ---
}
236 Riewald
need to define some ground rules with their parents about when they will talk
about races and what they will talk about. If the parent and athlete agree that no
discussion of the race will occur until the car ride home, then the parent should
honor that agreement. The swimmer also needs to respect the predefined agree-
ment, even if he does not want to talk about a given race. The coach may need to
help define these boundaries, and parents and swimmers should be expected to
honor them. This approach of setting guidelines and expectations can facilitate
constructive communication and minimize unwanted distractions that could
otherwise come up on the competition pool deck.
Athlete and Athlete
Athlete-to-athlete communication can take various forms during a competition.
Although specific guidelines may need to be established between certain sets
of athletes (similar to the rules for parents and athletes), in general the coach
should strive to create a culture in which teamwork, sportsmanship, and positive
support are expected among teammates.
Race Strategy
One important facet of racing is for swimmers to know how they want to swim
a specific race and then to go out and swim that race. But the exhortation to “Go
out there and swim your race!” is often easier said than done. Swimmers may
find it difficult not to react to the other swimmers in the pool, and they can be
drawn away from the planned race strategy. A few things can be done to assist
in developing and sticking to a strategy come race day.
Develop a race strategy in advance of the big competition and practice it. All
of a swimmer’s training is designed for one thing—to prepare the athlete to swim
fast in competition. Part of that training should focus on developing strategies
and tactics for swimming the race (splits and pacing, number of kicks underwater
off the wall, breathing patterns, and so on), and these need to be practiced. As
with many of the items discussed so far, most of this preparation occurs before
the day of the meet, and it should be so ingrained into the swimmer that he
enters the competition with the confidence to swim the race as planned.
Drive the race strategy with data. As discussed in chapter 12, there are many
more ways to look at a race than simply analyzing splits. How does an athlete
swim a race most effectively? Is she a swimmer who needs to go out hard and
try to hold on, or is she more effective by negatively splitting a race? Should she
kick the full 15 meters underwater off each turn, or is she better off coming up
at 10 meters? Collect data from races throughout the season and use those pieces
of information to narrow in on the strategies that work for each athlete. Build
the race plan to maximize a swimmer’s strengths and minimize the weaknesses.
Emphasize routine. Again, nothing should change on race day, and the swim-
mers should follow the practiced prerace routines that have been shown to lead
to competitive success. For many athletes, visualization of the race unfolding

--- Page 248 Text ---

Competition-Day Strategies 237
exactly as planned is a part of the prerace preparation and routine that leads to
success in the pool.
Know the tendencies of the competitors. Swimmers are often told to ignore
the competitors in the pool and to focus just on themselves. That approach
is fine until the swimmer in the adjacent lane takes off on the first 100 of the
1,500-meter freestyle. Now what does your swimmer do? The best plan is to
scout opponents and understand their tendencies. Use the same race analysis
data to understand what the opponent is likely to do in the water so that your
swimmer is prepared for what unfolds in the pool and can react accordingly. A
swimmer will react much differently if, rather than coming into the race blind, he
knows that the rabbit who takes off at the start of the race has shown that he will
eventually fade and come back to the field. Use information to your advantage,
both to understand your own swimmers’ tendencies and to scout opponents.
Taking these relatively simple steps to develop and maintain a race strategy
will go a long way to achieving peak performances in the pool.
Maintain a Performance Diary
Many of the best athletes in the world keep a performance diary that contains
objective and subjective information about training and performance. This diary
would contain not only the sets performed in practice and the races and times
achieved in a meet but also information about how the swimmer slept the night
before the race; what she ate during the day; what she did to warm up; how things
felt before, during, and after the race; and so on. Athletes should be encouraged
to keep training and performance logs because they serve as useful resources
for identifying the strategies and factors that should be in place to achieve peak
performances. Being able to look back at a year of training data, along with the
athlete’s comments, can help a coach and swimmer develop athlete-specific
training and preparation strategies that will help drive success in the pool.
An example of a performance diary for a swimmer is presented in table 11.2.
The specifics of the information contained in the diary presented here are not as
important as the concepts conveyed. Tracking this information and reviewing
it periodically will help identify patterns and trends of things that support fast
swimming performance and things that may detract from performance.

Injury Management and Recovery
What happens immediately after the race is critical to how a swimmer will
perform in subsequent races. Recovery has been a theme of much of the infor-
mation presented thus far—cooling down to clear lactate, fueling the body to
replenish energy stores, and so on—but athletes must also learn to take care of
any injuries. Competition pushes the body to limits that it does not attain in
practice, and the physical demands imposed by racing can aggravate, or in some
instances even cause, injury.
Athletes need to address injuries appropriately and follow the advice of medi-
cal providers, even in competition. The treatment for a soft-tissue injury such as
a strain, sprain, or tendonitis should typically be to follow the PRICE principle.
Each letter stands for one aspect of treatment the swimmer should follow:
Protection: Immediately following a session (or a race if there is enough time
between events), protect the area from excessive movement to encourage
healing and to minimize any additional damage that could occur.
Rest: Avoid performing any activity that causes pain in the injured area.
Ice: Apply ice to the injured areas for approximately 15 to 20 minutes. Ice
helps control inflammation within the injured structures. Athletes should
not apply heat to a soft-tissue injury unless directed to do so by a health
care professional. In many instances, heat will only induce more swelling
and is counterproductive during the initial phase of healing.
Compression: Compression, even when not applying ice, will help to mini-
mize inflammation and swelling. Use an ACE bandage to wrap the injured
area firmly but not so tightly that blood flow is restricted. Start by wrapping
at the point farthest from the heart and move toward the torso. Loosen the
bandage if you feel any numbness or tingling.
Elevation: To reduce swelling, elevate the injured area above the level of the
heart when possible.
Again, these are general guidelines. The best advice is for swimmers to follow
the recommendations of their medical provider to achieve the best results.
Develop a Checklist
As we have seen in this chapter, at every competition each swimmer needs to do
a list of things, from remembering to put the goggles in the swim bag to making
sure to bring an extra suit in case one splits. Most swimmers carry around a
mental checklist of what needs to be done, but the better method is to write
down the checklist on paper or enter the checklist into a tablet or smart phone
and then actually go through the entire list before each competition or race. The

Competition-Day Strategies 239
world of sport offers some fantastic examples of athletes who forgot something
in their preparation for a key competition, even though they had done the same
thing hundreds of times before. We all should learn from their mistakes and
make sure that those deterrents do not sabotage the swimmers on race day.
What should the checklist consist of? It should be a combination of general
points, the things that all swimmers need to do such as pack suit, goggles, towel,
and cap, and athlete-specific items such as prerace music and nutritional snacks.
The coach should encourage each swimmer to develop a personal checklist and
then go through that checklist with the athlete. The checklist should contain
things that the swimmer needs to do the night before the competition, the morn-
ing of the competition before leaving for the pool, during the meet and before
each race, and after the session has ended. As boring as it may sound, before
each meet and even before each race within a meet, the swimmer should walk
physically through the checklist to make sure that all the steps have been taken
and that nothing the swimmer can control is being left to chance. A swimmer
might have the following items, among others, on the checklist:
• Set the alarm the night before the meet to prevent oversleeping.
• Eat breakfast before leaving for the pool.
• Pack two pairs of goggles in case the goggle strap breaks.
• Make sure that the racing suit and other identified equipment is in the swim
bag.
• Bring nutritional snacks and enough of them to consume throughout the day.
• Pack the iPod with the prerace psych-up music.
• Bring the diary to write down thoughts about the race.
• Refuel appropriately after each race or session.
Following these simple steps can help reduce stress and anxiety while putting
the athlete in a better position to succeed on race day.
Summary
The first take-home message from this chapter is that competition should be fun.
It should be the reward for all the hard work put in over months and sometimes
years of training. Squandering all that hard work simply by forgetting something
on race day would be a shame.
Swimmers should never do anything new or try anything new on race day.
They need to use tried-and-true strategies that have proved successful before and
have positively affected performance. Trying something new just because it is
available or because other top athletes are using it is a mistake.
Coaches and athletes must plan tirelessly and think about the scenarios that
can play out at a competition. They should develop solutions for challenges such
as the lack of a cool-down pool or limited nutritional options and practice them
before getting to the meet.

Every athlete should have a codified prerace or precompetition routine that
can help prepare the body for competition while also focusing the swimmer
on attaining the right energy state for competing. This precompetition strategy
should include a warm-up and cool-down strategy, appropriate music to play
before a race, visualization, and so on.
Swimmers need to plan for the nutritional challenges that are likely to occur
at a meet. In short, all athletes should be encouraged to bring their own food
and not rely on the venue-provided foods.
Athletes should develop checklists and follow them to avoid forgetting things
important to being ready to compete. Communication plans for interactions
between athlete and coach and between athlete and parents during a competi-
tion should be developed and practiced. Overall, coaches should strive to create
an atmosphere of fun!
Following these basic principles will go a long way to enhancing the per-
formance of swimmers on race day, whether it is a local competition or the
Olympic Games.

CHAPTER
Analyzing Elite
Swimming Performances
—Jodi Cossor, PhD
As the science of swimming has developed, the need to analyze competitions
and the myriad factors that contribute to peak performances has evolved.
Every aspect of an athlete’s race, whether it is the start, a turn, or race strategy,
offers an opportunity to improve and gain an advantage over competitors. Coaches
have always used a stopwatch to record times and take splits within a race, but this
information typically tells only part of the story about a race. Some coaches go
an additional step and monitor the stroke rate in either strokes per minute (SPM)
or seconds per stroke (SPS), and this information starts to paint a more detailed
picture of what an athlete is doing in the water. Now technology has advanced
to the point that it is possible to get even more detailed information about swim-
ming performances that go far beyond split times and stroke rates. Tapping into
this information and digging deep into the race factors to understand where
races are won and lost is the emerging field of race analysis. By assessing what
happens within a race, coaches and athletes are able to adapt their race models
to maximize their potential and take advantage of their competitors’ weaknesses.
Even small insights gained through race analysis can enable an athlete to make
technical or tactical changes during a competition and, more important, capitalize
on opportunities and strengthen weaknesses over the following training cycle.
By using the race analysis support systems found as a part of many swim-
ming programs, these days it is possible to capture more accurate and detailed
information than coaches have previously been able to generate on their own.
In theory, because the analysis is typically automated or performed with the
assistance of a technical team, the coach is free to concentrate on the race and
provide useful feedback to the swimmer soon after the event rather than simply
focusing on capturing splits. This approach provides a powerful combination
that is being used all over the world.

History of Race Analysis and Evaluation
of Swimming Performances
The foundation of a race analysis system is the automatic capture of data from
athletes as they swim or from video of the race to pull out the pertinent perfor-
mance data. The development of race analysis systems has been an evolution
of sorts. The first Olympic Games to be analyzed by swimming researchers was
the 1988 Games held in Seoul, Korea (Kennedy et al. 1990). The analysis relied
on the technology available at the time. Early race analysis systems required
scientists to trawl manually through recorded video of a race and physically
draw lines on transparent sheets placed over the video monitor to indicate the
various distances in the pool. The scientists recorded the times required for each
swimmer to execute various aspects of the race and manually input the infor-
mation into a database to assist with further calculations, such as computing
the swimmer’s velocity. Stroke rates were measured directly using a stopwatch
to record the time needed by the swimmer to execute a specified number of
strokes (e.g., from right-hand entry to hand entry three strokes later), giving a
stroke rate in either stroke cycles per minute (SPM) or seconds per stroke (SPS).
By knowing swimming velocity and stroke rate, it was then possible to calculate
stroke length, or the distance travelled during a stroke cycle, for various points
in the race. This process was time consuming and labor intensive.
As technology improved, the analysis process became more automated and at
the same time more accurate, to the point that results could be provided within
minutes of the end of the race rather than the months it took to analyze races
in a major competition using earlier methods. Even so, multiple sport scientists
from various nations often filmed the races to conduct independent analyses
for their own teams. Continued technological developments such as machine
vision, which has the potential to track defined objects such as a swimmer’s
cap to measure real-time velocity and race segment times, aim to automate the
process further so that less equipment and fewer staff are required to analyze
more swims simultaneously and with greater accuracy.
Today’s race analysis systems typically come in one of several flavors, depend-
ing on the scope of the analyses to be performed. Larger analysis systems tend
to use multiple fixed cameras that have specific views of the pool, but none
are able to follow a swimmer through a complete race, so they cannot be used
effectively for feedback between swimmers and coaches. The separate images
do allow a better field of view that permits accurate analyses, because the vari-
ous cameras and the spaces they are filming can be calibrated to provide more
accurate velocities and segment times. This approach uses similar processes to
the original race analysis systems but includes better technology and software
packages. Tracking of swimmers would be much easier if specific colored caps
were used or computer chips could be placed on the cap or suit of the swim-
mer. Current FINA rules do not refer specifically to the use of colored caps or
computer chips, although reference is made to prohibiting devices that may

--- Page 254 Text ---
|
Analyzing Elite Swimming Performances 243
aid performance. The color of the cap normally is related to the team that the
swimmer competes for, and the chip may change the profile of the swimmer
and potentially increase drag as the swimmer moves through the water. For now,
advances in camera technology still enable programmers to remove the noise
of light and water around swimmers to track them in the pool. Researchers in
Australia (Bruce Mason), Europe (Rein Haljand), France, Spain (Raul Arellano),
and the United States have the capability to run these large systems, but they
still generally require a large staff to operate them.
More portable and user-friendly systems have been developed in Great Britain,
Australia, Japan, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. Generally, these systems
are made up of a small video camera mounted on a tripod that is connected to
a laptop to capture the race footage directly to a computer in electronic format.
The race analysis is completed after the race is finished, usually as soon as a gap
in the schedule allows. Feedback to coaches and athletes is usually multifaceted,
combining video of the swim shared through computers or iPads and numerical
data provided by reports generated from the quantifiable data recorded by the
system. Feedback is typically provided to the coaches and athletes both at the
pool and at team accommodations to satisfy their needs based on the competi-
tion and rest schedules.
Data Collection
As mentioned earlier, a typical race analysis aims to provide detailed information
to coaches so that they can find small areas of improvement that can be used to
enhance athlete performance either in the next race or at subsequent competi-
tions. The data that is collected contains both temporal and performance data.
Time is relatively easy to measure. In most instances, information about the actual
split times is taken directly from the official timing system at the competition.
To provide more detailed analysis within a specific length of the pool, the pool
is often divided into sections for further analysis.
Besides providing lap split times, many race analysis systems record and track
additional temporal variables such as the following:
• Start time. The start time is the time from the gun until the swimmer’s
head passes through a set distance, usually 15 meters. Within this parameter,
information can be provided on the time that the swimmer spends on the block
as well as when the swimmer enters the water after the flight phase and surfaces
after the underwater phase. Because most swimmers surface before the 15-meter
mark, a free-swimming component is included in this time.
• Turn time. Turn times tend to have the greatest variation in measurements
when comparing systems among countries, but most measure the time it takes
the athlete to swim from a predefined distance out from the wall when entering
the turn until the swimmer passes a second predefined point when exiting
the turn. Early turn information measured the time it took for the swimmer’s
head to travel from 7.5 meters in to the wall and back out to the same distance.

--- Page 255 Text ---
}
244 Cossor
Other systems use 5 meters in and out (the distance from the backstroke flags
to the wall) to compute turn times, because this distance is easy to measure in
both competition and training. Some systems use 5 meters in to the wall and
10 meters out, whereas others use 5 meters in to the wall and back out to 15
meters. In every case, the scientists aim to use distances that most closely relate
to the turn component and rely on swimmers’ maximizing their speed when
traveling underwater such that they should be aiming to surface as close to 15
meters as possible after each wall. Like the start time, turn time includes some
information on the actual swimming (not just the turn), but the use of set dis-
tances allows comparisons to be made among different swimmers.
• Finish time. As the swimmer finishes a race, the finish time is measured
from the time the head passes the 5-meter mark until the hand is on the wall.
An allowance is made for the swimmer’s outstretched hand during this phase
because all other time measures taken during the race are based on the position
of the head when it crosses specified landmarks. The main advantage of recording
the finish time is to determine whether any decrease in velocity occurs during
the final few strokes of the race.
• Lap segment times. Within each lap a swimmer is highly unlikely to travel
at exactly the same speed through each 50-meter segment of a race. So to provide
more detailed analysis and give a better picture of how speed may change within
a lap, the pool length may be divided into several segments. The most traditional
division occurs at the 25-meter mark (for long-course competitions), giving two
segments per lap, but other systems divide the lap into three to five segments.
This method allows a more accurate representation of what is occurring at each
stage of the race, but it can also been seen as providing too much information,
particularly in longer events.
• Velocity. Using the time and distance data generated from the free-swim-
ming components of the race analysis, velocity can be calculated using the
formula V = d / t, where velocity (V) is expressed in meters per second (m / s),
distance (d) is the traveled distance measured in meters, and time (t) is the time
in seconds it took to cover the set distance. Velocity can be computed as an aver-
age for the entire length of the pool or for smaller predefined segments within
a lap. A swimmer’s velocity is also influenced by stroke rate and stroke length,
and the mathematical relationship is shown in the formula V = SL × SR, where
velocity (V) is measured in meters per second, stroke length (SL) in meters per
stroke cycle, and stroke rate (SR) in stroke cycles per second.
• Stroke rate (SR). Stroke rates are not always used by coaches, but they
can help increase the understanding of how efficient a swimmer is through-
out the various free-swimming segments of a race. This measurement can be
taken relatively easily using a stopwatch as the time needed to complete a set
number of stroke cycles. Stroke rates for all four strokes are typically expressed
as stroke cycles per minute (or second) and do not look specifically at indi-
vidual strokes (e.g., a single arm pull in freestyle or backstroke). This number
represents the number of strokes that a swimmer would take in each unit of

--- Page 256 Text ---
|
Analyzing Elite Swimming Performances 245
time if he maintained the same stroke rate for an entire minute (or second).
To measure stroke rates accurately in freestyle and backstroke, the time must
be recorded between consistent points within a stroke cycle, such as from one
right-hand entry through to the following right-hand entry. Each complete
stroke in breaststroke and butterfly is also classified as a stroke cycle because
both arms are pulling at the same time. If calculating the stroke rate using the
SR function available on many stopwatches these days, the coach would time
how long it takes the swimmer to complete three full stroke cycles. Note that
some coaches and race analysis programs may express SR in a slightly different
way, as seconds per stroke cycle. When using this convention, SR is computed
by again measuring the time taken by the swimmer to complete a set number
of stroke cycles (usually 10) and dividing this time by the number of stroke
cycles completed.
• Stroke length (SL). Stroke length, the distance that a swimmer travels in
each stroke cycle, is a bit more complicated to measure than stroke rate. Some
coaches like to count the number of strokes per lap and divide this by the distance
travelled, typically incorporating some form of allowance for the underwater
phase. A more accurate measure, however, is to use the equation that swimming
velocity = stroke rate × stroke length, where stroke rate is expressed in cycles
per second (V = SR × SL). If velocity and stroke rate are known, it is possible
to solve for stroke length (SL = V / SR). The general trend is that an increase in
stroke rate results in a decrease in stroke length, resulting in a similar velocity.
In many races, swimmers increase their stroke rate in the final 15 meters. Stroke
length usually decreases when stroke rate increases, and this decrease in stroke
length may offset any gains from increased stroke rate, resulting in decreased
swimming velocity and an increase in energy use.
• Stroke count. Counting strokes is simple to do, and it is measured as a
count of individual arm strokes rather than cycles for all strokes. Most swim-
mers cover a set distance (e.g., 50 meters) using a consistent number of strokes
for a given pace. Coaches are able to monitor changes in stroke efficiency by
noting any changes in stroke count for a given pace. Additionally, they can note
changes throughout a race and gain a feeling for how technique changes. In
general, swimmers tend to have a lower stroke count on the first lap of a race,
but they should be fairly consistent for every lap thereafter if the race is made
up of only one stroke. A change in stroke count could result from a change in
the underwater distance, stroke length, and kick rate.
• Efficiency index. Some race analysis systems include information on the
efficiency of the swimmer through the calculation of an efficiency index. An
efficiency index is computed as the product of swimming velocity and stroke
length (efficiency index = V × SL) and is measured in m2 / s (i.e., a high efficiency
rating means fast and long swimming). This measure allows comparisons to be
made within a swimmer, but not between swimmers. An ideal race would be
one in which a swimmer has a minimal decrease in the efficiency index between
the first and last free-swimming segments of the race.

Race Analysis Feedback
People tend to prefer receiving information and data feedback in one of three
main formats: video, graphical, or numerical. Therefore, most of the reports gen-
erated from the race analysis provide information in both graphical and numeri-
cal formats to facilitate interpretation. A video is also provided to accompany the
data so that coaches and swimmers are able to see what the numbers mean and
relate that to what the athlete is doing in the pool. The video is usually the first
form of feedback that an athlete receives, and the coach can use it as reinforce-
ment to confirm or deny what was seen during the actual race. Some coaches
use the information right away, but others do not look at the race statistics until
they are planning the next training cycle and can account for the strengths and
weaknesses of the previous race to train for an improvement in the next race.
With more scientists and swimming federations providing race analysis during
competitions, further improvements to race evaluation and data interpretation
are being discussed. For example, let’s consider at the start. As highlighted earlier,
a number of factors can influence the final start time, including the time on the
block, the flight time while the athlete is in the air, the time underwater, and
the free-swimming phase. A wide range of parameters could be measured within
each of these phases, but doing this with the current analysis software packages
and hardware is not possible. But some countries have developed technologies
that can record force data from the blocks and integrate that with video to gain
a clearer picture of how start technique, specifically the forces that are generated,
affects overall start performance. Likewise, the turn should also be divided into
further components within the in phase, rotation phase, underwater phase, and
out phase of the skill, and these components should be monitored throughout
the race. The point where the weakness occurs is currently not always clear,
although it is easy to see whether one swimmer is better than another. Access
to underwater images for all lanes will further increase understanding of the
mechanics of the stroke, particularly at the point where efficiency drops off.
A fine line will always separate providing enough data to help improve perfor-
mance and delivering so much information that the coach and athlete become
overwhelmed and subject to paralysis by analysis. Race analysis will continue
to evolve as technology develops and we gain new understanding about the
factors that truly influence performance. Some areas currently included in race
analysis will remain; others may be discarded if people find that they are no
longer relevant to the outcome. Coaches can always work with their team scien-
tists after the competition to delve further into the race to measure something
specific to their swimmers.
Competition Data Examples
Now that we have established a theoretical framework about race analysis, let’s
look at some of the ways in which a coach can use race analysis to dissect a race

--- Page 258 Text ---
|
Analyzing Elite Swimming Performances 247
and make decisions that can affect athlete performance. A number of researchers
provide race analysis to coaches from all nations during selected competitions.
One of these is Rein Haljand of Estonia, who is responsible for the analysis of
LEN competitions held in Europe. The information provided by his analysis
group can be invaluable both during the competition and afterward because it
allows detailed analysis of all swimmers in the semifinals and finals, whereas
other systems may focus on individual athletes.
The website http://swim.ee/competition/index.html contains information
from competitions that Mr. Haljand and his team analyzed and the way in which
they conduct the race analysis. Mr. Haljand has developed and adapted a software
and analysis package over the years to work with the latest technology as well as
to provide information quickly. Fixed cameras set up along the length of the pool
require only one operator and one person to analyze the videos, which makes it
portable and efficient. The current version provides information on stroke rates
at various stages of the race, depending on the length and type of race. Turn in
and out times are provided, and this data can be used with information on race
splits such as those found at www.omegatiming.com to generate substantially
more information about the race.
An example of the data output from this analysis system is outlined in table
12.1. The table shows race data from the women’s 400-meter IM final at the 2010
European Long Course (ELC) Championships held in Budapest. Here are some
pieces of information to consider as you review the data:
• Block time, an estimate of reaction time, measures the time from when the
race starts to when the athlete actually leaves the block.
• Start time is the time to 15 meters.
• Within each length, two stroke rates are taken, one in the first 25-meter
segment of the pool and the other in the second 25-meter segment.
• Split times taken at various points as the athlete approaches and leaves the
wall give an idea of turn times and where speed is being gained or lost.
Using this information, it is relatively easy to make direct comparisons among
the swimmers in the race in both their splits and stroke rates for each of the four
strokes. As evident from the data presented, most swimmers have quite even
stroke rates for the two laps of butterfly except Hosszu, who shows a difference
of 10 SPM, suggesting a lack of efficiency in one of the two laps. By looking at
more of her individual races, her coach would be able to determine the rate at
which she is the most efficient and work on this during training. The rest of the
race appears to be similar for all swimmers between the first and second stroke
rates calculated in each stroke. Although comparing one swimmer to another is
often helpful in understanding what the best are doing and how they swim their
races, the true power of race analysis comes in looking at data from an individual
swimmer and seeing how those numbers change within a race or over time.
Coaches can use this information to enhance the skill components of the race,
which have been shown to be important to the result of many races (Arellano

Analyzing Elite Swimming Performances 249
et al. 2000; Blanksby, Nicholson, and Elliott 2002; Burkett, Mellifont, and Mason
2010; Mason 1997). For example, the reaction and start times to 15 meters show
that Hosszu was on average 0.5 seconds faster to 15 meters than the other swim-
mers in the race although her block time (the total time on the block from when
the gun is fired until the toes leave the block) was not the fastest in this race. In
shorter events, the start time can make up more than 20 percent of the overall
race time (Mason and Cossor 2001), but it is less important to the outcome of
longer races.
Taking the information presented in table 12.1, turn times were calculated
for each swimmer, and those times are presented in table 12.2. Turn time was
computed as the time needed to cover the 5 meters in to and 15 meters out of the
wall. Because the event was an individual medley, each turn time was expected
to be different, but the fastest (bold) and slowest (italics) swimmer could still
be identified for each turn.
In the example, Zavadova showed the slowest turn times in five of the seven
turns, and Miley had the fastest turn times for three of the seven turns. Coaches
can use this information to identify strengths as well as areas where swimmers
can improve relative to the competition. Although the information presented in
table 12.1 may seem like a jumble of numbers at first glance, after coaches have
had time to become familiar with the data and understand what it means, they
are quickly able to identify areas of strength and areas in need of improvement.
A second example of how the race analysis can be used to evaluate perfor-
mance is illustrated using data from the men’s 100-meter backstroke final at the
European Championships (table 12.3).
Note that more information is included in this table because of the shorter
duration of the event. More changes are expected to take place in shorter events
like this, so this analysis shows split information for a greater number of seg-
ments in each lap. The assumption is that stroke rates would not vary much in
this event, so only one parameter is calculated for each lap.
The time turned in by Camille Lacourt was a European record at the time. We
can see how he achieved this by looking closely at the free-swimming and skill
components of the race. Table 12.3 shows that Lacourt did not have the fastest

start time to 15 meters (Donets did at 6.18 seconds), but table 12.4, generated
from information on www.swim.ee and www.omegatiming.com, shows that his
total turn time was 0.18 seconds faster than Donets’ time. The outbound turn
time (time from feet touching the wall until the head passed the 65-meter mark)
was similar for the two swimmers, so Lacourt gained the advantage during the
inward turn phase (the time from the head passing the 45-meter mark until the
feet touched the wall).
Table 12.3 shows that Lacourt increased his stroke rate slightly between the
first lap and the second, whereas Tancock and Stravius decreased theirs slightly.
It is unlikely that this would account for the differences in velocity among the
swimmers. Based on this information, the assumption is that Lacourt was able
to maintain a greater stroke length (longer stroke) throughout the race compared
with the other medalists. Consequently, this aspect would be something that
Lacourt’s competitors could work on in the future to improve race performance.

Attention can then be focused on the free-swimming segment data for further
information about the race. Figure 12.1 is a graph generated from the race analy-
sis; it tracks the free-swimming velocities for the medalists Lacourt, Stravius,
and Tancock. The graph shows that for every segment, Lacourt was the fastest
swimmer in the pool, and he appeared to increase his velocity from the first to
the second segment, something that the other two medalists did not do.

Race analysis data is valuable not only for comparing one swimmer with
another but also, when used regularly over time, for charting improvements
within a given swimmer. Figure 12.2, produced from the website www.swim-
rankings.net, highlights the dramatic improvement in performance for Camille
Lacourt in the 100-meter backstroke over an 18-month period. The graph illus-
trates that his performance improved steadily and continued to improve even
after the changes to the swimsuit rules. Further analysis of his race statistics will
give greater understanding of where the dramatic improvements came from and
how others in the same event can maximize their performances.
As these examples have shown, coaches and swimmers can gain a great deal
of information from race statistics that are available freely on the Internet from
a number of websites. What they choose to do with this information is generally
limited only by imagination. The more that people play with the numbers, the
more questions they will likely come up with.

Improving Performance
Each swimmer has an optimal stroke rate and stroke length, depending on fac-
tors such as athlete physiology, anthropometric variables, and event distance,
but coaches and swimmers should know that it is possible to alter both stroke
rate and stroke length during different phases of the training cycle to maximize
swimming velocity throughout the race. After the free-swimming phases of
the race have been optimized, individual skill components of the event can
be improved. As discussed earlier, the start and turn can be broken down into
a number of phases, but finding accurate information on how swimmers per-
form in those areas during competitions is generally not possible. The easiest
area to improve is the underwater phase of both starts and turns, because the
velocity underwater is faster than the free-swimming velocity in many events.
Swimmers have some choices to make about how to optimize underwater per-
formance; they can choose to use large-amplitude, small-frequency kicks or a
small-amplitude, large-frequency technique to generate propulsion. No general
recommendations apply to all swimmers when it comes to identifying the best
kick, so swimmers should experiment with various techniques to find the one
that works best for them.
Kicking is a trainable skill, and all swimmers should practice various tech-
niques off every wall to see the benefits. Depending on the athlete, several limit-

ing factors, such as range of movement in the hip region, can affect performance.
Most of these areas can be improved easily through specific interventions such
as stretching techniques. As a rule, coaches should train athletes to maximize
both the distance off the wall in the underwater phase and the kicking speed.
Evolution of Competition Analysis
Research and Findings
With information having been collected at major competitions for more than 40
years, a number of research groups have attempted to make sense of the reams
of data and information that has been collected. Generally, this analysis has
relied on a large group of people to collect and then analyze the video footage to
provide race statistics, but as technology improves, so does the processing speed.
As mentioned earlier, the first race analysis of an Olympic Games was per-
formed in 1988; nearly all 400 swimmers who competed in the heats of the 100-
meter events, across all four strokes, were filmed and analyzed. Stroke length
and stroke rate were computed from the video footage and then combined with
age, height, and race time. The main findings of this research were the following:
• The men were faster, taller, and older and had longer stroke lengths than
the women.
• Each stroke (FR, BA, BR, FL) appeared to differ from the others in the rela-
tionships between stroke rate, stroke length, and final time and velocity.
An international team then analyzed the swimming events at the 1992 Olym-
pics in Barcelona. One of the papers written by Arellano et al. (1994) focused
on the 50-meter, 100-meter, and 200-meter freestyle races. More than 300
swimmers who competed in these events were analyzed so that trends could
be highlighted. All swimmers who competed in both the heats and finals had
their fastest swim time used for statistical purposes. Races were analyzed to
determine the start time (time to cover the first 10 meters), turn time (from 7.5
meters in to the wall and back to the same point), and finish time (the final 10
meters of the event). Information on the free-swimming component of the race
included the time for set distances (varying from 30 to 35 meters, depending
on the lap) and stroke rates over five stroke cycles. The distance and time were
then used to calculate the velocity in the midsection of the pool. Stroke length
was derived from the velocity and stroke rate information. Swimmers reported
their own age and height. Because of the close relationship between height
and weight, weight was not included in the research. The research produced
the following results:
• Males were approximately 9 percent faster, older, and taller than the
female swimmers competing in the same events. For example, the males
had between 9.0 and 9.4 percent longer strokes than females and were 9.1
percent faster for the event time in the 100-meter freestyle.

• A strong correlation was found between stroke length and event time.
Swimmers who were more successful (based on time) had a longer stroke
length compared with their competitors. As expected, height was a major
contributor to having a longer stroke length.
• Surprisingly, stroke rate was significantly correlated only to height in the
women’s 50-meter freestyle and to the start time in the women’s 200-meter
freestyle.
• As the race distance increased from 50 meters to 200 meters, the swimmers
tended to be younger and the stroke rates decreased.
In a more detailed analysis, Cappaert, Pease, and Troup (1995) conducted
a three-dimensional analysis of the swimmers in the center lane for the heats
and finals of the men’s 100-meter freestyle. They found the following results:
• Elite swimmers (those in the cyclically seeded heats and finals) had a lower
hip roll angle compared with the shoulder roll angle, but they both occurred
in the same direction.
• The subelite swimmers (those in the unseeded heats) had greater lateral hip
movement and less body symmetry compared with the elite group.
• The calculated propulsive forces were more effective throughout the stroke
rather than demonstrating larger forces within the elite group.
• The elite athletes were more streamlined, which aided in their superior
performance compared with the subelite group.
A team led by Dr. Bruce Mason of the Australian Institute of Sport was respon-
sible for analyzing the swimming races at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.
Fixed cameras were placed in the overhead gantry and were then cabled back
to a central analysis room. More than 40 staff and volunteers worked around
the clock to provide feedback to all swimmers qualifying for the semifinals and
finals before the next round of competition. As in previous research, each race
was divided into the free-swimming and skill components for analysis. Starts
were defined as the time from the starting signal until the swimmer passed the
15-meter mark, and turns were measured for the 7.5 meters in to the wall and
back out to the same point. Finishes were the final 5 meters of the race, but
0.5 meter was allowed for the outstretched arm during velocity calculations.
Stroke rate, stroke length, and velocity were calculated for each of the free-
swimming sections. All this information was provided as a table and graph.
Individual reports and a summary of eight swimmers in the semifinals and finals
were generated.
Researchers wrote numerous papers using this data, including information on
the different strokes (Chatard et al. 2001a, 2001b, 2001c, 2001d, 2001e), med-
alists versus nonmedalists (Girold et al. 2001), swimming efficiency (Riewald
2001; Wilson et al. 2001), and distances (Arellano et al. 2001). Mason and Cossor
(2001) looked specifically at the turns, and Cossor and Mason (2001) focused on
the starts. Ikuta, Mason, and Cossor (2001) then compared the Japanese final-

ists with other finalists in the 100-meter events. All research was supported by
FINA. The research initiatives produced several key findings:
• Chatard et al. (2001d) and Girold et al. (2001) found that the fastest back-
stroke swimmers had a higher stroke rate and lower stroke length than the
nonmedalists.
• In the breaststroke events, a long stroke length was important for the female
swimmers, whereas for the men performance in the third 50-meter lap was
most highly correlated with race time.
• Turns and the breaststroke leg were seen to be important and distinguishing
factors in the women’s individual medley results.
• The first lap was important to overall placing in the women’s freestyle event,
whereas turns were important for the men’s freestyle.
• Although previous research had suggested the relevance of stroke length
to overall performance, Riewald (2001) found no significant differences
between the finalists and semifinalists when looking at normalized stroke
length and normalized efficiency (both normalized to athlete height).
• Mason and Cossor (2001) found significant relationships between the turn
in and out times in the short-axis strokes (butterfly and breaststroke) as well
as the underwater phase of the turn.
• The fastest turns were those in which the swimmer spent more time and
travelled farther under the water.
• The start analysis showed that the underwater phase was significantly cor-
related to good start times to 15 meters (Cossor and Mason 2001).
• Ikuta, Mason, and Cossor (2001) showed that skill performance is important
to overall race results. They speculated that inferior skills by the Japanese
swimmers resulted in poor swims compared with those of the other com-
petitors.
• Arellano et al. (2001) noted the lack of trends in race strategies of elite
swimmers.
A French team was contracted by FINA to analyze the swimming events
during the Athens Olympic Games. Cameras were set up perpendicular to the
swimming pool and recorded at a central station. Analysis of the race variables
was then provided to the national teams for all finalists and semifinalists on the
day after the event had been swum. Hellard et al. 2008 compared the 200-meter
race analysis of female French swimmers from their Olympic Trials with their
performances in Athens. The start was the time needed to reach 15 meters, turns
were 7.5 meters in to the wall and back out again, and the finish was defined
as the final 7.5 meters of the race. Stroke rate was calculated from one stroke
cycle, and one rate was used for each 100-meter race segment. The changes in
variables over the course of the race were measured, and they showed that less
difference occurred in the stroke rate variability for elite swimmers compared

with national-level swimmers. The velocity drop-off between the first segment
and the last segment was least in freestyle and greatest in breaststroke.
Additional research by Pyne, Trewin, and Hopkins (2004); Trewin, Hopkins,
and Pyne (2004); and Costa et al. (2010) looked at performance progressions
over time and found that approximately 1 percent improvement is seen each
year in top-ranked swimmers.
Practical Applications: Competition
What can coaches do in their home environment with this wealth of swimming
competition information? The first step is to collect as much race-specific infor-
mation on the athlete as possible, looking specifically at the free-swimming and
skill components of a race. As discussed earlier in the chapter, figure 12.3 presents
graphically the factors that contribute to swimming performance. The second
step is to use this information within the training environment to improve per-
formances at the next major competition. During less important competitions,
coaches may be able to focus on one particular skill (i.e., fast turns, negative
splitting, or lower stroke count) rather than the entire race strategy.
Where can coaches get their data? Generally, split times are provided by the
official timing systems used at each competition, so coaches should be free to
step back and watch the race or collect additional information. Dividing each
lap into different segments and measuring times needed to cover each segment
provides an estimate of the velocity throughout the lap. The first 25-meter sec-
tion in each length is usually faster than the second because of the push-off
from the wall in a start or turn.
To obtain additional data, the most accurate way to analyze performances
is by using video-recording equipment. But if this is not available, coaches can
enlist the services of a parent or another swimmer to collect stroke data. Stroke
counts are simple to measure, and stroke rate can be determined using most
stopwatches. The greater the number of stroke cycles used to calculate the stroke

rate, the more accurate it will be, but this can be difficult when observing more
than one swimmer in a race. Aim to time at least three complete stroke cycles
when possible. Stroke rate can be measured in either SPM or SPS, as mentioned
earlier. Coaches will have a personal preference about calculating and referring
to stroke rate when working with their swimmers.
A crude method of calculating stroke length is to divide the number of stroke
cycles by the distance traveled. Maglischo (2003) suggested using the 40-meter
section between the flags to limit the influence of the turn in the calculation. If
a butterfly swimmer takes 18 strokes to cover 40 meters with a stroke rate of 46
strokes per minute using the stroke rate feature on a stopwatch, the following
information can be computed:
Stroke length = distance / stroke count
= 40 / 18
= 2.22 meters
Stroke rate = 46 strokes per minute
= 46 (strokes) / 60 (seconds)
= 0.77 stroke cycles per second
Velocity = stroke length (in meters per stroke cycle) ×
stroke rate (in stroke cycles per second)
= 2.22 meters per stroke cycle ×
0.77 cycles per second
= 1.71 meters per second
Race Analysis Equipment
Some new technologies, and some not so new, can help coaches break down
races. Stopwatches such as the NK (www.nkhome.com) can store splits and
stroke rate information that can then be downloaded to a computer using their
software. Therefore, one skilled operator is all that is required. Most coaches
will find taking splits and stroke rates throughout a race easier than what they
do in most training sessions.
The video performance monitor produced and sold by YSDI (ysdi.jp) is a
slightly larger tool that is able to monitor the stroke rate, stroke length, and
velocity of a swimmer throughout a race. A video signal can be input into the
system so that the data is saved onto the race footage, and the printout produces
both numerical and graphical formats of the race variables.
Although many countries have developed and use their own race analysis soft-
ware, one is available for purchase (www.natrisoft.nl/sportswatch/en/products.
html) and is used by a number of European teams. A pocket version is available
as well as the more detailed software for laptop use when the races are filmed
and analyzed after the event. In some instances, the database of earlier competi-
tions can be purchased so that comparisons can be made with other swimmers.

Practical Applications: Training
Research has been mixed on the benefits of analyzing stroke rate and stroke
length in practice to find optimal values for each. Improving either of these
variables, however, is likely to improve swimming velocity. In general, as stroke
length increases, stroke rate decreases. The net result is relatively little change to
swimming velocity. This phenomenon can be seen particularly during the last
segment of a race when swimmers tend to increase their stroke rate but do not
increase their swimming velocity. As a general recommendation, stroke length
can be improved by minimizing the number of strokes taken per lap while
maintaining set times. When this has become automatic, swimmers can work
on increasing their stroke rate. Although an increased stroke rate is likely to be
more beneficial in the shorter events, this trend has not always been seen in the
literature. Sprinters need to be able to hold the water to generate power from
each stroke and may have adopted a flatter sprinting technique. Coupled with a
longer stroke length and lower stroke rate, this approach can lead to improved
performances in some swimmers. Keep in mind, however, that all swimmers
have an optimal stroke rate that is influenced by the swimmer’s physiology and
anthropometry. Remember that more is not always better (i.e., higher SR does
not always translate to faster swimming) because any deviation from the optimal
SR leads to wasted energy.
An additional area of focus for the coach and athlete should be the underwater
portion of a race. Swimmers should work on this skill every day in training. Not
everyone is good underwater after starts and turns, but nearly all swimmers can
develop this skill. Underwater distance can be maximized early in the season,
and speed can be improved later. Watching athletes such as Michael Phelps,
who excels in the underwater portion of a race, highlights the advantages that
can be achieved in this phase, even at the end of a 400-meter IM. The goal for
elite swimmers should be to travel with a velocity of approximately 2 meters per
second when under the water, because this is faster than most free-swimming
velocities and is simple to measure during training. Start and turn times can be
measured over set distances and monitored throughout a training season, but
for consistency the same person should be used.
Coaches can also incorporate test sets into training that factor in a combina-
tion of pacing, stroke count, and stroke rate to produce a score that, in turn, can
be used to evaluate performance and progress toward developing more efficient
strokes.
• Pacing sets: Pacing is required in most training sets, and the more effective
the swimmer can become at achieving the set times, the more effective the
set can become.
• Stroke count sets: Swimmers can count their strokes and provide feedback
to the coach in training. This method does rely on honesty, but stroke count
is a simple marker that all swimmers in the training group can use.

Analyzing Elite Swimming Performances 259
• Stroke rate sets: Measuring stroke rate does become a little more complicated
in the training environment, so in this instance some people find it easier
to use one stroke cycle rather than three.
After swimmers have done these sets more than once, they quickly identify
ways in which to improve their scores. But because these performance indices
are related to the key race components, any improvements in the test sets have
the potential to improve race performance.
Summary
The monitoring of swims in competitions and training can provide valuable
insight into performance and identify ways in which swimmers can improve
their performances. Although systems are available to generate a wide array
of data, race analysis does not need to be user intensive or require expensive
equipment to provide the swimmer and coach with insightful information.
Combining the data with video footage appears to be the most effective form
of feedback during competitions. A number of teams around the world use this
approach. In using race analysis data, race strategies should be designed with
the swimmer’s strengths and weaknesses in mind. The ideal performance model
should include information on desired splits, stroke rates, and stroke counts.
Start and turn times are also easy to record and can provide feedback that can
lead to improved performance. The bottom line is that coaches and athletes
alike can benefit from this type of analysis and should use it as a regular part
of training.

CHAPTER
Overtraining
and Recovery
—Randall L. Wilber, PhD, FACSM
Unfortunately, when training does not go as planned, an athlete may reach
a point of overtraining. Many Olympic athletes experience overtraining
at some point in their careers. A survey conducted by the U.S. Olympic Com-
mittee (USOC) sport psychology staff after the 1996 Atlanta Olympics revealed
that an astonishing 28 percent of Team USA athletes indicated that they had
overtrained for the Games and that this overtraining had a negative effect on
their performance. These U.S. Olympians also identified tapering, resting,
traveling less, and staying healthy as changes they would make if they could
prepare again for the Olympics. Overtraining is not limited to elite athletes.
In fact, it may be just as prevalent among subelite and recreational athletes,
especially endurance athletes.
This chapter provides athletes and coaches with scientifically based informa-
tion on overtraining. Specific sections include the following:
• Terminology: overreaching versus overtraining
• Symptoms of overtraining
• Causes of overtraining
• Prevention of overtraining
The information provided in this chapter will help athletes and coaches better
understand overtraining and therefore be better equipped to avoid it.

Terminology:
Overreaching Versus Overtraining
Many terms are used in reference to overtraining, including overtraining, under-
recovery, unexplained underperformance, and chronic fatigue syndrome. For
the purpose of this chapter, we will use the two basic terms—overreaching and
overtraining—to describe the various aspects of the overall phenomenon known
as overtraining.
Distinguishing between overreaching and overtraining is important. Whereas
overreaching is positive training and necessary for an athlete to improve perfor-
mance, overtraining is negative training that results in a decrement in performance.
In general, overreaching and overtraining can be distinguished by the following
characteristics:
Overreaching
• Short-term effects, lasting on the order of days
• Reversible with recovery
• Positive training adaptation, necessary to improve performance
Overtraining
• Long-term effects, lasting on the order of weeks or months
• Irreversible with recovery
• Negative training adaptation, causes chronic poor performance
Perhaps the best way to think of overtraining is as the extreme point on a
continuum. As shown in figure 13.1, a single training session produces an acute
physiological stimulus and accompanying fatigue. A series of several high-
intensity workouts may result in overreaching. For example, a four-week training
macrocycle composed of three progressively harder weeks followed by a week of

Overtraining and Recovery 263
recovery is commonly classified as overreaching; the initial three weeks of hard
training provide a progressive overload and produce abnormal fatigue, but the
fourth week provides time for the athlete to recover and regenerate. This rest
allows positive physiological and psychological adaptations to take place and
performance to improve. Without the recovery week, however, an athlete who
follows essentially the same program of high-intensity training may become
overtrained. Of course, the challenge lies in being able to walk that line, know-
ing how to overreach without overtraining.
Symptoms of Overtraining
More than 100 documented symptoms of overtraining appear in the scientific
literature. Therefore, identifying an overtrained athlete using only one or two
telltale signs is not possible. Perhaps a better way to think of the symptoms of
overtraining is as a picture puzzle containing hundreds of individual pieces. The
individual pieces can be compared to the many symptoms of overtraining; the
more pieces of the puzzle you have lined up and pieced together, the better you
are able to make an accurate assessment of overtraining.
A number of the physiological, biochemical, immunological, and psychologi-
cal symptoms that have been used to describe the overtrained athlete are shown
in table 13.1. Some of these symptoms are synergistic to one another (i.e., they
occur together), whereas others are more isolated in nature. Collectively, this
large and varied number of symptoms provides an appreciation of the complex
nature of overtraining.
Again, it is naive to think that we can identify and diagnose overtraining
in athletes based on one or two symptoms, such as an abnormal elevation in
morning heart rate or an increased level of the skeletal muscle enzyme creatine
kinase (CK). Coaches thus need to be familiar with the full spectrum of over-
training symptoms so that they can be on the lookout for potential clusters and
patterns with athletes. Continue to think in terms of the picture puzzle analogy.
The more pieces you have lined up and fit together, the clearer the overtraining
picture will be. Let’s look at some of the symptoms of an overtrained athlete in
a bit more detail.
Physical and Physiological Symptoms
of Overtraining
The most obvious symptom of overtraining is a consistent decrease in per-
formance. This decrease in performance may be in comparison with what a
swimmer achieved earlier in the season or with a performance achieved in a
similar training phase from a previous season, when performance was relatively
good and at a level expected by the coach and athlete based on the prescribed
training. The overtrained athlete has reduced tolerance to the required train-
ing load, which may be seen in the inability to complete training sessions.

Table 13.1 Symptoms of Overtraining
Performance Consistent decrease in performance compared with earlier in the current season
or at the same point in the previous season
Prolonged recovery after workouts and competition
Reduced toleration of training load; inability to complete workouts
Decreased muscular strength
Loss of coordination
Deterioration of technical skills
Physiological Increased heart rate at rest, during submaximal exercise, and during recovery

Increased muscle and joint injury
Immunological Increased susceptibility to colds, flu, and allergies
Swelling of the lymph glands
Bacterial infection
Slow healing of minor cuts
Abnormal white blood cell (WBC) profile on blood test
Biochemical Reduced muscle glycogen level
Elevated serum cortisol
Decreased serum ferritin (iron deficiency)
Mineral depletion
Menstrual dysfunction such as oligomenorrhea (irregular menstrual periods) or
amenorrhea (lack of menstrual periods)
Decreased bone mineral density
Psychological General apathy and lethargy
Lack of concentration
Mood changes
Decreased self-esteem
Fear of competition
The overtrained athlete typically needs significantly more recovery after work-
outs and competitions and may present excuses for not wanting to practice or
train as scheduled. Loss of strength and coordination are evident, and technical
skills are negatively affected.
Overtraining has a number of physiological symptoms as well. These include
perturbations to normal cardiac response, as evidenced by abnormal elevations
in overnight resting heart rate, as well as higher submaximal and recovery heart
.
rates. Maximal exercise capacity (e.g., maximal oxygen uptake, or VOmax;
2
maximal swimming velocity) is commonly reduced in the overtrained state,
and physiological economy and efficiency are poorer because of overtraining.
Overtrained athletes typically have a significant reduction in total body mass,
including both lean mass and fat mass. Poor sleep and ongoing fatigue are also
major physiological symptoms of overtraining. Contributing to chronic fatigue

Overtraining and Recovery 265
and poor performance is a reduced appetite and potential gastrointestinal dis-
turbances. Overtrained athletes often complain of skeletal muscle soreness and
appear to be more prone to muscle and joint injury.
Immunological and Biochemical Symptoms
of Overtraining
Overtrained athletes typically present with certain immunological disturbances
and symptoms. In general, overtraining has a compromising effect on the
immune system, leading to greater susceptibility to colds, flu, and allergies. In
addition, overtrained athletes may be more prone to bacterial infection. Signs
of a disturbed immune system are swollen lymph glands, slow healing of cuts
and bruises, and an abnormal white blood cell differential (neutrophils, lym-
phocytes, monocytes) as documented by a standard blood test.
Several biochemical indicators show that an athlete may be overtrained.
Muscle glycogen levels are often reduced because of the inability of the athlete
to replace carbohydrate stores adequately following training sessions. Addition-
ally, overtrained athletes typically have an abnormally elevated level of the stress
hormone cortisol because of the accumulated physical or psychological stress
that comes from both training and nontraining activities. Abnormally low levels
of serum ferritin are often seen in overtrained athletes, suggesting potential
iron depletion or iron deficiency. In overtrained female athletes, menstrual
dysfunction such as oligomenorrhea (irregular menstrual flow) or amenorrhea
(absence of menstrual flow) may be seen. A decrease in bone mineral density
may be present in overtrained athletes, both male and female.
Psychological Symptoms of Overtraining
Finally, a number of psychological symptoms are present in overtrained athletes.
Overtrained athletes exhibit a general sense of apathy and lethargy for both sport
and nonsport activities. Lack of concentration will likely be evident when an
athlete is overtrained, especially during technical training sessions and team-
based drills. Overtrained athletes often display mood swings, and their overall
self-confidence suffers. An obvious symptom of overtraining, especially among
elite athletes, is hesitancy to engage in formal competition. This reluctance is
a telltale sign of overtraining for top-level athletes because, after all, competi-
tion is a fundamental part of their overall being and essentially their means of
making a living.
In summary, coaches should be aware of numerous documented and anec-
dotal symptoms of overtraining. Remember that overtraining cannot be identi-
fied by using only one or two markers. Rather, overtraining is a condition that
involves a relatively complex interaction of human physiology, biochemistry,
immunology, and psychology that ultimately has a negative effect on athletic
performance. Having a working knowledge of these various symptoms can help
coaches identify and prevent overtraining in their athletes.

266 Wilber
Causes of Overtraining
Athletes and coaches often ask, “What causes overtraining?” This question is diffi-
cult to answer, and neither sport scientists nor coaches have a precise explanation
for how an athlete becomes overtrained. Several working hypotheses have been
proposed to help define the causes of overtraining. These working hypotheses are
described here and are based on the symptoms of overtraining—performance,
physiological, immunological, biochemical, and psychological— outlined in
the previous section of this chapter.
Chronic Glycogen Depletion
Chronic glycogen depletion has been proposed as a potential cause of over-
training. Heavy training loads—relatively high volume or intensity—combined
with inadequate glycogen replacement following workouts and competition are
thought to lead to chronically low muscle glycogen stores. Glycogen is stored in
the muscles and liver and is broken down by the body to produce glucose, which
in turn fuels muscle contraction as well as many other functions throughout
the body. Adequate carbohydrate ingestion before, during, and after practice is
essential to ensure that glycogen levels are replenished to levels that can maintain
high-level athletic performance. If chronically low muscle glycogen stores persist
over several days, the athlete may become overtrained. Let’s look in more detail
about why this might occur.
Recall that three metabolic pathways produce the biochemical energy, known
technically as adenosine trisphosphate (ATP), to fuel muscle performance during
swim training and competition. The first metabolic pathway is known as the
adenosine trisphosphate (ATP)–creatine phosphate (CP) energy system. It relies
on endogenously stored phosphagens to produce the ATP used in dynamic,
explosive sporting events of relatively short duration such as diving and weight-
lifting.
The second metabolic pathway is known as the anaerobic glycolytic energy
system. It relies on the breakdown of the stored form of carbohydrate—muscle
glycogen—to blood glucose, which is then metabolized to produce a limited
amount of ATP for sustained sprint events such as a 100- or 200-meter swim or
a 400-meter run. In addition, the anaerobic glycolytic energy system produces
lactic acid, which contributes in part to fatigue along with other metabolic,
neuromuscular, and psychological factors.
The third metabolic pathway is known as the oxidative phosphorylation
energy system. Like the anaerobic glycolytic energy system, the oxidative phos-
phorylation energy system begins by breaking down liver and muscle glycogen
stores into glucose that can be used within the muscle itself or, in the case of
glycogen, stored in the liver. The glucose enters the bloodstream, where it can
be transported to the working muscles. Blood glucose is ultimately metabolized
in the mitochondria of the muscle cell. A single molecule of glucose produces a
relatively large amount of ATP for sustained aerobic events such as a 10-kilome-

--- Page 278 Text ---
|
Overtraining and Recovery 267
ter open-water swim or a marathon. In addition, the oxidative phosphorylation
system produces no lactic acid.
In the sport of swimming, Olympic events range from the 50-meter freestyle
sprint (2014 world records are 20.91 seconds for males and 23.73 seconds for
females) to the 10-kilometer open-water swim (about 1 hour 52 minutes for
males and about 2 hours for females). Regardless of which events swimmers
compete in across this wide range, they have to train all three energy systems to
some degree. Obviously, the 50-meter sprint athlete will train the ATP–PC and
anaerobic glycolytic systems to a greater degree than the oxidative phosphory-
lation system. At the other end of the spectrum, the open-water 10-kilometer
swimmer will train the oxidative phosphorylation system to a large degree,
put secondary emphasis on the anaerobic glycolytic system, and put minimal
emphasis on the ATP–CP system. The important point here is that all swim-
mers, regardless of event, spend significant time training either one or both of
the energy systems (anaerobic glycolysis, oxidative phosphorylation) that rely
on glycogen or glucose as their primary source of energy. Thus, to avoid over-
training, swimmers need to focus on replenishing muscle glycogen stores on a
workout-by-workout basis. Recommendations for replacing glycogen in a timely,
practical, and scientifically based manner are given later in this chapter in the
section “Prevention of Overtraining.”
In summary, chronic glycogen depletion has been proposed as a potential
cause of overtraining. Heavy training loads combined with inadequate glycogen
replacement following workouts and competition are believed to lead to chroni-
cally low muscle glycogen stores. This, in turn, contributes to overtraining as
evident by symptoms of persistent muscular fatigue, inability to complete work-
outs as expected, deterioration of technical skills and swimming mechanics,
and loss of strength and power.
Immunosuppression
Training-induced suppression of the body’s natural immune system has been
proposed as a possible cause of overtraining. Heavy training loads (relatively
high volume or intensity) and the accompanying physiological and psychologi-
cal stress are believed to produce chronically elevated levels of cortisol. Cortisol
is a stress hormone secreted by the zona fasiculata region of the adrenal cortex.
Physical or psychological stress serves as a potent trigger for the release of cor-
tisol into the blood. Abnormally elevated serum cortisol levels are often seen in
athletes, especially elite athletes. This makes sense, given the high physiological
and psychological stress that accompanies training for elite-level sport. Thus,
athletes are prone to be right on the edge of overtraining during periods when
the training load results in relatively high physiological and psychological stress.
But abnormally high serum cortisol levels can produce several physiological
responses, including suppression of the effectiveness of the body’s natural
immune system. Cortisol-induced suppression of the immune system can provide
an open door through which an athlete may become predisposed to illness or

--- Page 279 Text ---

268 Wilber
injury. This circumstance, in turn, can lead to overtraining, as evident by chronic
illness, an injury that fails to heal with proper treatment, and abnormal white
blood cell counts.
Research has shown that proper overnight sleep can have a positive effect on
attenuating abnormal increases in serum cortisol. Similarly, a commercial car-
bohydrate electrolyte drink such as Powerade or Gatorade can have a beneficial
effect on reducing serum cortisol levels. We discuss these strategies in detail in
the next section, “Prevention of Overtraining.”
In summary, heavy training loads and the accompanying physiological and
psychological stress are thought to produce chronically elevated levels of the
stress hormone cortisol. Significantly elevated serum cortisol levels may lead
to overtraining by suppressing the body’s natural immune system, causing the
athlete to become chronically fatigued, sick, or injured.
Autonomic Nervous System Imbalance
An imbalance of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) may be a cause of over-
training. Heavy training loads and psychological stress are believed to lead to
impaired brain function, which ultimately results in overtraining. The ANS
is composed of the sympathetic (SNS) and parasympathetic (PSNS) nervous
systems. The SNS is often referred to as the fight-or-flight system. Its activity
is dominant during times of excitement, danger, emergency, and, of course,
exercise. Characteristics of an activated SNS include a significant increase in
heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, and sweat rate, all of which
are positive effects during exercise. The PSNS is sometimes called the resting
and digesting system. It is dominant during quiet, nonstressful situations such
as lying on the couch watching TV. When the PSNS is activated, blood pres-
sure, heart rate, and respiratory rate are relatively low and are considered to be
at baseline levels.
The ANS imbalance model of overtraining suggests that extensive training
loads (relatively high volume or intensity) and accompanying psychological stress
lead to impaired function of the hypothalamus, which is located in the brain
and controls the ANS. The result is an imbalance of the ANS, affecting either the
SNS or the PSNS, depending on the athlete’s specific sport or event. Impairment
of the SNS (sympathetic overtraining) is typically seen in team sports and sprint
or power athletes, whereas impairment of the PSNS (parasympathetic overtrain-
ing) is more common among endurance athletes. So, depending on the athlete
and his events, either system could contribute to overtraining in swimming. In
addition, sympathetic overtraining is considered an early and less debilitating
form of overtraining, whereas parasympathetic overtraining is viewed as an
advanced and more serious form of overtraining. A few of the symptoms of
sympathetic and parasympathetic overtraining are similar, but most of them
are different or even opposite in nature, as shown in table 13.2.
In summary, autonomic nervous system imbalance may be a cause of over-
training. Heavy training loads and psychological stress are thought to lead to

impairment of the hypothalamus, which in turn results in either sympathetic
overtraining or parasympathetic overtraining. Sympathetic overtraining is
believed to be more common in team sports and sprint or power sports or events,
and it is considered an early form of overtraining. In contrast, parasympathetic
overtraining is believed to be more prevalent in endurance sports or events, and
it is considered an advanced form of overtraining.
Central Fatigue
The word central in central fatigue refers to the central nervous system, that is, the
brain. Training- and dietary-induced changes in brain neurochemistry may be a
cause of overtraining. Heavy training loads (relatively high volume or intensity)
in combination with inadequate postworkout or postcompetition carbohydrate
replacement are believed to result in chronically low muscle glycogen stores.
As a result of low muscle glycogen, there is a greater reliance on branched-
chain amino acids (BCAAs) for energy, mostly during endurance exercise. This
greater utilization of BCAAs increases the amount of free tryptophan (fTRP)
that crosses the blood–brain barrier and enters the brain. fTRP is a biochemi-
cal precursor for 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), more commonly known as the
neurotransmitter serotonin. The result of this process is a significant increase in
serotonin, a powerful chemical neurotransmitter that produces lethargy, sleepi-
ness, moodiness, and depression. Thus, the psychological symptoms evident
in an overtrained athlete may be because of changes in brain neurochemistry
that can be traced back to a significant increase in training load combined with
inadequate glycogen replenishment.
Elevated Proinflammatory Cytokines
Within the human immune system, specific chemicals called proinflammatory
cytokines are produced. As the name suggests, they promote inflammation in
various parts of the body. An abnormally high level of these proinflammatory

--- Page 281 Text ---
}
270 Wilber
cytokines may be a cause of overtraining. Excessive training-induced musculo-
skeletal stress (relatively high volume or intensity) in combination with insuffi-
cient recovery can result in chronic skeletal muscle inflammation or joint trauma.
In turn, this chronic skeletal muscle inflammation triggers the release of several
proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β), interleukin-6
(IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-). As shown in figure 13.2, these
proinflammatory cytokines
• affect the central nervous system, resulting in loss of appetite, sleep distur-
bances, and negative mood changes;
• affect the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis, resulting in increased
levels of the stress hormones (cortisol, epinephrine, norepinephrine), lead-
ing to immunosuppression; and
• affect the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis, resulting in de-
creased levels of testosterone and luteinizing-hormone-releasing hormone,
decreased skeletal muscle anabolism, and impaired reproductive function.
Thus, according to this model, overtraining may be caused by excessive
amounts of circulating proinflammatory cytokines, which in turn produce nega-
tive psychological and physiological effects through the brain and endocrine
system that ultimately prevent the athlete from training and competing effectively.

Prevention of Overtraining
As previously mentioned, athletes and coaches face a challenge in knowing when
they have crossed the boundary between overreaching and overtraining. Whereas

--- Page 282 Text ---
|
Overtraining and Recovery 271
overreaching is considered positive training that is necessary for an athlete to
improve performance, overtraining is negative training and can result in loss of
training time and a significant decrease in performance. The following practical
strategies are offered as potential tools to prevent overtraining.
Recognition of Overtraining Risk Factors
In general, overtraining risk factors can be organized into three categories
based on athlete, sport, and training. Table 13.3 outlines several risk factors for
overtraining.
Athlete Personality
Coaches need to be on the lookout for potential overtraining risk factors within
the athlete’s inherent personality.
• Perfectionism. Athletes who possess a perfectionist or obsessive-compulsive
personality and who are highly motivated toward success may be more prone to
overtraining than those who have moderate goals and are less motivated to reach
them. Working with a highly motivated and perfectionist athlete is like wielding a
double-edge sword. Perfectionism and exceptional motivation will probably lead
to outstanding performances and attainment of high goals but may ultimately
lead the athlete across that fine line from overreaching into overtraining.
Table 13.3 Risk Factors for Overtraining
Athlete Perfectionist or obsessive-compulsive personality
Excessive level of motivation
“More is better” training approach, based on either good or bad performance
Resistance to taking time off from training, whether because of injury or illness or not
Sport specialization at an early age
Eating disorders or disordered eating
Competitive schedule designed to chase points or money
External stressors such as home, school, work, relationships, money
Sport Ultrasports such as Ironman events, multiday cycling events
Multisports such as triathlon or pentathlon
Endurance sports such as marathon
Sport that allows little or no individualized training
“Meat grinder” sports such as distance running in Kenya or soccer in Brazil
Training Overloading adolescent athletes during growth spurts
Transition from junior or developmental level to senior level and accompanying in-
crease in training load
Lack of scientifically based periodization leading to imbalance of stress and recovery
and overtraining
Knee-jerk response to underperformance leading to an excessive increase in training load
Training individually with minimal or no face-to-face coaching and objective monitoring
Training with significantly more skilled or fit athletes
Poor monitoring of recovery workouts
Olympic or world championship season
Lack of scientifically based taper
Coaching by a former successful elite athlete
Change in training environment (e.g., heat, humidity, altitude)

272 Wilber
• “More is better” approach to training. This personality trait is another one
that athletes and coaches should be aware of in regard to overtraining. It may
become a factor leading to overtraining coming out of a good performance or,
more likely, after a subpar performance when the athlete is looking to do what-
ever is necessary to get back on track. Often the athlete and coach will decide
to work harder in an effort to get back to performing as expected. Instead of
working harder, however, a better approach may be to work smarter and include
more, not less, rest and recovery. This decision to work smarter by adding more
rest and recovery instead of blindly working harder is difficult for athletes and
coaches to make, particularly coming off a poor performance. Thus, coaches
and athletes need to communicate openly and consider all the factors involved
in a subpar performance before deciding to do additional and harder training.
• Resistance to taking time off when needed. Other personality-based over-
training risk factors for coaches to be aware of are situations when the athlete is
resistant to taking time off from training, even when injured or ill. This counter-
productive behavior overlaps with an obsessive-compulsive type of personality.
• Disordered eating. Other dangerous behaviors that can contribute to over-
training are eating disorders and disordered eating. Professional help should be
sought if an athlete demonstrates these types of behaviors.
• High levels of external (nontraining) stress. Finally, external stressors
such as the home environment, family or personal relationships, school or job
demands, and financial burdens can contribute to an athlete’s inability to train
effectively. These circumstances should be on the coach’s radar as potential
overtraining risk factors.
Sport
The sport that the athlete participates in may also be a risk factor for overtrain-
ing. Athletes who participate in ultrasport events such as the Ironman event or
multiday cycling races are relatively prone to overtraining because of the high
training volume required to be successful in those events. The same can be said
for multisport events such as triathlon and traditional endurance sport events
such as the marathon or distance swimming.
In addition, sports that allow little or no individualized training can cause an
athlete to get lost in the training progression and ultimately reach an overtrained
state. This issue may surface in individual sports such as club-based swimming,
in which a relatively large number of athletes and a limited number of coaches
prevent adequate one-on-one interaction and the development of individualized
training programs. The same may apply to team sports such as soccer, in which
team play and strategy take precedence over individualized training.
Finally “meat grinder” sports are notorious for producing overtrained athletes.
A meat grinder sport is one in which a relatively large number of athletes, usu-
ally at a young age, enter the sport at the top of the meat grinder, so to speak.
Ultimately, a relatively small number of elite-level athletes emerge from the

bottom of the meat grinder at the expense of several of their fellow athletes, who
are ground up or overtrained in the process. Examples of meat grinder sports
include gymnastics in China, distance running in Kenya and Ethiopia, and
soccer in Brazil. Some have argued that swimming is a meat grinder sport in the
United States.
Training
The training program carried out by athletes and their coaches may include
several overtraining risk factors that should be evaluated.
• Inappropriate training load. Overloading adolescent athletes during growth
spurts may lead to overtraining. Similarly, junior or developmental athletes who are
making the transition to the senior level may become overtrained because of the
accompanying increase in training load. For all athletes, a training program that lacks
a scientifically based periodization structure, including a well-designed taper, can
lead to chronic imbalances between stress and recovery and, in turn, overtraining.
• Poor monitoring of recovery. Another training-based overtraining risk
factor is poor monitoring of recovery workouts. In this scenario, athletes are
assigned a moderate-intensity workout but instead feel good and end up doing
a high-intensity workout, thereby throwing the entire training week out of bal-
ance and stacking several hard workouts on top of one another.
• Little interaction between coach and athlete. Other training-based risk
factors include training individually with minimal or no face-to-face coaching
or objective monitoring, training with significantly more skilled or fit athletes,
and sudden changes in the training environment, such as a sudden move to a
hot and humid environment or to a different altitude.
• Ramping up for the big meet. Finally, one training-based risk factor is more
prevalent in elite athletes than in nonelite athletes. Elite athletes often formally
or informally ramp up their training during the Olympic or world champion-
ship season to a level that takes them across the fine line from overreaching to
overtraining. The thinking becomes, “I need to do more, something special,
something harder than I have ever done before, so that I can be ready to compete
successfully in the Olympics.” Again, this attitude becomes a double-edge sword
for the Olympic-caliber athlete. On the one hand, the increase in training load
may be a key factor to success at the Olympic Games, but it may also take the
athlete into the realm of overtraining. Recall from the first section of this chapter
that 28 percent of U.S. Olympic team athletes said that they had overtrained in
preparation for the 1996 Atlanta Olympics.
In summary, if overtraining is to be avoided, coaches must have a good work-
ing knowledge of the risk factors of overtraining. We have discussed in this
section three general categories of overtraining risk factors: athlete, sport, and
training. For example, athletes who exhibit a perfectionist personality along
with an excessive level of motivation may be prime candidates for overtrain-
ing. Sports that require a relatively high training load (volume or intensity) may

produce a greater number of overtrained athletes than technically based sports
do. Training programs that are not scientifically based or are poorly monitored
are prone to produce overtrained athletes. Coaches who are able to detect these
overtraining risk factors in their athletes and act effectively to keep them under
control will likely be successful in preventing overtraining from taking place.
Scientifically Based Training Program
The best way to prevent overtraining is to use a scientifically based training plan
that includes periods of progressive overload in combination with adequate
recovery and regeneration. This type of training program will result in optimal
performance at the peak of the competitive season. The training program should
be organized and periodized to ensure a logical and systematic progression in
the training load based on the four physiological principles of training:
1. Sport specificity: The program should be designed to train the body for a
specific sport or activity.
2. Progressive overload: The stress or overload applied to the human body must
be progressive and gradual, avoiding the alteration of too many training
variables such as volume, duration, intensity, and recovery at the same time.
3. Individualization: The program should be designed to meet the physical
capabilities, limitations, and goals of each athlete.
4. Tapering and peaking: The final days of training before a major athletic
event should have a lower training load to allow increased recovery and
peak physical performance.
Dr. Iñigo Mujika of Spain has conducted extensive research on tapering in
elite athletes. Much of his research is summarized in chapter 10. Although the
details about tapering appear there, a summary of the recommendations for
tapering is included here because of its importance for maximizing rest and
recovery and optimizing performance:
• Training intensity should be either maintained or increased during the taper
period to prevent detraining.
• Training volume should be reduced by 40 to 60 percent.
• Training frequency should be maintained to prevent detraining.
• Positive physiological and performance adaptations can be expected as a
result of a taper that lasts about two weeks.
• Progressive, nonlinear tapers seem to produce better performances than
step-wise or linear tapers.
Detailed Monitoring of Training Response
Systematic and detailed monitoring of the athlete’s response to training is criti-
cal to the prevention of overtraining. This checking can be done through open

--- Page 286 Text ---
|
Overtraining and Recovery 275
communication between the athlete and coach or by having the athlete keep a
detailed training diary. The training diary should include physical and psycho-
logical responses to training such as heart rate, weight, length and quality of
sleep, tiredness sensation, training willingness, appetite, competitive willing-
ness, and muscle soreness. These training responses should be tracked daily. The
coach should be looking for any patterns that might suggest that the athlete is
moving from the overreaching stage to the overtraining stage.
In addition, laboratory or field tests can provide valuable information regard-
ing the athlete’s response to training and the potential for overtraining. Several
laboratory tests can be used to monitor training response:
.
• Maximal oxygen consumption (VOmax)
2
• Lactate threshold velocity (swim, run)
• Lactate threshold power output (bike)
• Economy (doing the same work with less effort)
• Maximal velocity (swim, run)
• Maximal power output (bike)
The following field tests can be used to monitor training response:
• Time trials (whole or partial competition distance)
• Any workout designed to mimic the protocol of a laboratory test
• Benchmark workouts or standardized test sets that can be performed peri-
odically as part of training and used to evaluate progress
Nutritional Intervention
As stated in a previous section, “Causes of Overtraining,” proper nutrition,
particularly carbohydrate consumption, is important for long-term training pro-
gression, regardless of the swimming event. Muscle and liver glycogen stores can
be depleted during daily workouts. Inattention to glycogen replacement could
result in overtraining, as suggested in the chronic glycogen depletion and central
fatigue models of overtraining. In addition, research has shown that commercial
carbohydrate drinks such as Gatorade and Powerade help reduce abnormally
high levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which can impair normal function of
the immune system (see the immunosuppression model of overtraining). Taken
together, we can see that proper carbohydrate intake is a crucial nutritional
strategy for the prevention of overtraining.
Chapter 14 deals exclusively with swimming nutrition, but some key concepts
are presented here about proper nutrition and its role in preventing overtraining.
An effective carbohydrate supplementation regimen requires the athlete to consume
the proper type of food or drink before, during, and after a workout or competition:
• The athlete should consume a high glycemic index (GI) drink or food,
such as a commercial carbohydrate drink, bagel, or baked potato, three to

--- Page 287 Text ---
}
276 Wilber
four hours before a workout or competition or a low GI food, such as an
apple, banana, or flavored yogurt, 30 to 60 minutes before a workout or
competition.
• The athlete should consume a moderate to high GI drink or food, such as
a sports drink or power bar, during the workout or competition.
• The athlete should consume a high GI drink or food, such as a sports drink,
bagel, baked potato, or watermelon, immediately and for up to two hours
after the workout or competition.
Use of a protein additive containing essential amino acids may also be ben-
eficial in the postworkout or postcompetition period because it may stimulate
the insulin response and ultimately enhance glycogen replacement. It may also
aid in the repair of skeletal muscle breakdown incurred during the workout or
competition.
Although most athletes are probably attentive to replenishing carbohydrate
stores during and after a competition, they tend to neglect carbohydrate supple-
mentation before, during, and after daily training sessions. Athletes in training
should be aware of this tendency and make sure that carbohydrate supplemen-
tation and replacement are as much a part of the daily workout as the warm-up
and cool-down are.
In terms of vitamin and mineral intake, swimmers in training may want to
consider the following to reduce the risk of overtraining:
• Beta-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E for their antioxidant properties
• Folate, vitamin B, and vitamin B for their positive effects on the immune
6 12
system
• Zinc, selenium, and copper for their positive effects on the immune system
• Iron for its positive effect on red blood cell production and cytochrome-c
oxidase
These vitamins and minerals be obtained through a well-balanced diet and
a good multivitamin. Additional supplements containing these vitamins and
minerals may not be necessary. In fact, oversupplementation may be unhealthy.
Blood Chemistry
To help reduce the tendency toward overtraining, blood chemistry tests should
be conducted periodically throughout the training season. Three to five blood
tests during the season can provide a strong database from which the coach
can make good decisions about how to proceed with training. Although some
coaches prefer to do blood testing using a chronological schedule such as every
three or four months regardless of the training phase, we recommend that blood
testing be done at times related to specific training and competition scenarios.
This testing schedule can help the coach make better decisions about the ath-
lete’s subsequent training plan. For example, blood testing can be beneficial

--- Page 288 Text ---
|
Overtraining and Recovery 277
in evaluating the athlete’s current state in response to a hard training block to
determine how much rest and recovery is needed. Or blood testing could be
done after a recovery period to see whether the athlete is ready to begin another
hard training block.
Another recommendation regarding blood testing is for coaches and athletes
to work with someone who is knowledgeable in interpreting blood chemistry
results in the context of a well-trained swimmer. Most likely, this person will
be a sports medicine physician, exercise physiologist, athletic trainer, or other
certified health professional. For example, to the untrained eye, an abnormally
high creatine kinase (CK) level may cause concern. But a health professional
who is used to evaluating blood chemistry results of athletes will have minimal
concern because skeletal muscle microtrauma (and thus elevated CK) is a normal
and expected response in well-trained athletes.
Blood chemistry tests need not be extremely expensive. A relatively com-
prehensive test that can be repeated three to five times a season can be done
for less than $50 (U.S.). Although limited budgets will prohibit coaches from
having all their swimmers tested regularly, we believe that blood testing for top-
end athletes, particularly those prone to overtraining, is a good investment of
funds and an item that should be built into the seasonal budget. Table 13.4 lists
several blood chemistry parameters and the accompanying physiological and
performance-based rationale for each panel of parameters. Again, the budget of a
typical team will not realistically allow regular evaluation of all these parameters.
We suggest that the coach communicate with a local hospital or laboratory to
identify a reliable place to perform blood testing.
Training During Illness
Athletes may become sick during the season. How an illness is handled relative
to training and competition can be the difference between becoming overtrained
and returning to normal health. A commonly asked question among athletes
is, “Can I train or compete when I’m sick?” In general, if the sickness is in the
throat or below, the answer is no. If the sickness is above the throat, however, the
answer is yes, if the athlete wants to train or compete. Here are some guidelines
for training or competing during illness:
If the illness is in the throat or below, the athlete should take time off from
training and competition to recover. In this case, the athlete is experiencing
symptoms of systemic involvement such as fever, extreme fatigue, muscle aches,
or swollen lymph glands. Submaximal and maximal exercise should not be
attempted. The athlete should allow two to four weeks of recovery before gradu-
ally resuming training.
If the illness is above the throat, the athlete can train and compete. In this
case, the athlete is experiencing symptoms of a common cold and has no sys-
temic involvement or fever. Submaximal exercise and short-duration maximal
exercise are OK. The athlete should attempt to get additional sleep and pay more
attention to proper hydration and nutrition.

Recovery Techniques
Athletes can use several recovery techniques to reduce the risk of overtraining.
Some of these techniques are relatively simple and inexpensive, whereas others
require special equipment.
One recovery technique that is easy to do but often overlooked or compro-
mised is passive recovery, or sleep. Athletes engaged in daily training should get
a minimum of seven to nine hours of sleep per night. Athletes plant the seeds of
improved fitness during the daily workout, but it is at night when they are sound
asleep that the garden grows. In other words, during the time of sound sleep the
body adapts to the physiological stress of the daily workout. The skeletal muscles,
cardiopulmonary system, enzymatic profile, and so on grow, thereby enhanc-
ing the athlete’s ability to perform physically. These positive adaptations occur
because of increased levels of human growth hormone and decreased levels of
cortisol that occur during deep, uninterrupted sleep. The stress hormone corti-
sol is at a very low level during the period of deep sleep from about midnight
to 3:00 am, indicating that little catabolic effect is taking place in the body. In
contrast, during the same period of deep sleep, a dramatic increase occurs in
human growth hormone, indicating a significant anabolic effect (the garden is
growing). Collectively, this combined effect of depressed cortisol and elevated
human growth hormone is beneficial for athletes who are attempting to recover
from hard training and ultimately improve their performance.
The critical factor driving this beneficial hormonal flux is deep sleep. We
cannot expect the same positive effects to occur if deep sleep is minimal,
interrupted, or compromised in any other way. Again, a good night’s sleep on
a consistent basis is one of the simplest, cheapest, and most effective ways to
prevent overtraining. Finally, afternoon cat naps (30 to 60 minutes) may also
be beneficial, but some athletes may be unable to nap during the day because
of school, job, and family commitments.
Another recovery technique that may reduce the chance of overtraining is
hydrotherapy, which can take the form of sauna, cold-water immersion, and
contrast baths. Low-intensity swimming and water running are effective hydro-
therapy techniques for nonswimmers. A poor man’s contrast bath can be done

280 Wilber
by simply standing in the shower and alternating cold and hot water every few
minutes for approximately 20 minutes.
An effective neuromuscular recovery technique is massage, which can be
done following workouts or competitions. Another simple but effective recovery
technique is monitoring hydration status, which can be accomplished by check-
ing total body mass, or scale weight, using the same accurate scale each time
and weighing in at the same time each day. Fluid replacement should make up
for the body weight lost.
Other effective and practical recovery techniques include pneumatic mas-
sage (e.g., Normatec) and low-frequency vibration of specific muscle groups.
These recovery techniques require special equipment that can be purchased
commercially.

Summary
Overtraining is common among athletes engaged in regular high-volume,
high-intensity training, and it is particularly prevalent in Olympic athletes. Dis-
tinguishing between overreaching and overtraining is often difficult. Because
overtraining appears to be caused by a complex combination of physiological,
immunological, and psychological factors, no single marker can quickly and
clearly identify overtraining.

Overtraining and Recovery 281
Recommendations to prevent overtraining include the following:
• Recognition of overtraining risk factors
• Adherence to a scientifically based training program that includes strategi-
cally placed recovery phases and a well-designed taper
• Detailed monitoring and documentation of the training response
• Nutritional intervention emphasizing carbohydrate replacement
• Periodic blood testing
• Wise decisions about training or competing when sick
• Daily use of recovery techniques, including passive rest
In closing, it would be wise to remember the words of coach Bobby McGee,
who has coached several athletes to World Championship or Olympic medals
including 1996 Olympic marathon champion, Josiah Thugwane of South Africa:
“More performances are spoiled by slight overtraining than by slight lack of fit-
ness. An athlete who is 90 percent conditioned for an event will do better than
an athlete who is 0.5 percent overtrained.”

CHAPTER
Nutrition:
Fueling for Performance
—Charlene Boudreau
The primary training goal of most competitive swimmers is to swim faster
and improve times. This type of training outcome can be achieved through
thoughtfully prescribed work that promotes a training response and adaptation.
Such a training program typically includes elements that target
• the development of the aerobic and anaerobic energy systems,
• the development of effective and efficient stroke mechanics,
• strength and conditioning and muscle development,
• the development of neuromuscular control and the neural processes related
to swimming performance, and
• solid nutritional practices that focus on fueling efficiency and recovery.
This last item is the focus of this chapter. After all, whether it’s breathing,
standing, warming up, or swimming through a demanding practice, every single
movement and muscular contraction requires energy from inside the body. The
foods and beverages that we consume help build and maintain those energy
stores and thereby affect performance in the pool. Call it training or call it
work—food provides the energy that we need to train, recover, and then train
again. And swimmers have more control over their nutrition and the way that
the body performs than they may think!
The mechanism through which nutrition affects swimming performance is,
at its core, a collection of intricately linked biochemical reactions. Although the
term biochemistry may strike fear into the heart of many swimmers, some rela-
tively simple explanations and examples show how this all works to influence
performance and how athletes can control the ways in which they approach nutri-
tion to swim better. This chapter integrates research and experience to provide
285

--- Page 297 Text ---
}
286 Boudreau
a practical approach to answering the two most common and fundamentally
important questions asked by swimmers and their support teams:
1. What exactly is fueling for performance?
2. What should I eat or drink, how much, and when?
What Exactly Is Fueling for Performance?
The mechanism by which nutrition affects performance is a collection of intri-
cately linked chemical reactions. The body’s overall performance is closely tied
to nutrition. The brain, which ultimately controls all body movements and
functions, relies primarily on blood sugar for fuel. The immune system relies
primarily on glutamine to function properly, sufficient stores of which rely on
sufficient dietary intake of carbohydrate. Explosive movements rely heavily on
glycogen, the storage form of carbohydrate, and fatigue is directly linked to gly-
cogen depletion. Additionally, carbohydrate has been the topic of many debates
related to nutrition and dieting, including the athlete’s diet.
Notice the repeated mention of glucose or glycogen, which highlights the
important role played by carbohydrate in how the body performs. Different,
but equally important, statements could be developed to draw attention to the
role that protein and fat play in supporting overall body function and athletic
performance. These statements offer just a taste of the complexity and reach of
nutrition in supporting athletes in terms of energy, fuel, and optimal health.
Staying well nourished helps swimmers maintain physical and mental perfor-
mance both in and out of the pool.
Food Is Fuel
Food and water are basic needs of the body, and both play critical roles in proper
and efficient muscle, organ, and energy system function. Food provides the body
with the six basic (and required) nutrients:
1. Carbohydrate: Carbohydrate is broken down by the body into sugar such
as glucose, and it is critical to swimming performance.
2. Protein: Although it provides little energy to the body, protein is essential
for building muscle and repairing damage that can occur during training.
3. Fat: Contrary to popular belief, dietary fat is essential to athletes. It provides
a dense source of energy, contributes essential fatty acids, allows fat-soluble
vitamins (vitamins A, D, E, and K) to be absorbed in the digestive tract, and
supports many physiological functions.
4. Vitamins: Vitamins are organic compounds that allow the body to produce
energy during exercise while also supporting a variety of other physiologi-
cal functions.
5. Minerals: Minerals are inorganic substances such as iron, calcium, and
sodium that assist in the breakdown of food and support many bodily

--- Page 298 Text ---
|
Nutrition: Fueling for Performance 287
functions. Like vitamins, minerals are not produced by the body and must
be consumed in the foods that people eat. The body needs more than 20
minerals to function properly, and these minerals must be available in suf-
ficient amounts to ensure health and athletic performance.
6. Water: Water makes up as much as 60 percent of total body weight (75 per-
cent in lean tissues like muscle), and adequate intake of water is critical in
the function of many physiological systems. Dehydration, a loss of body
water, can quickly lead to impaired performance.
These nutrients can be used immediately or stored in the body to be used
later. Consider the following examples of how the body works to use food to
support immediate and long-term energy needs.
To be stored or used as fuel, all dietary carbohydrate must ultimately be con-
verted to glucose. This simple sugar can be taken up by muscles or the liver for
storage as muscle or liver glycogen. Muscle glycogen is used in the formation of
adenosine triphosphate (ATP), an immediately available source of energy for
most body functions and all explosive sport movements. Liver glycogen can be
converted back to glucose and transported by blood (i.e., blood sugar) to organs
such as the brain that need to use it as a fuel source. Every gram of carbohydrate
provides the body with approximately four kilocalories.
Dietary fat is stored as triglycerides in subcutaneous, visceral, and intramus-
cular locations, and it must be converted to free fatty acids to travel in the blood
and be used for fuel during, for example, low- or moderate-intensity sets or events
of 200 meters or longer. Every gram of fat provides the body with approximately
nine kilocalories. A healthy, well-nourished body can store 30 to 40 times as
much energy as fat than as carbohydrate (see table 14.1).
Dietary protein is stored as a structural element of the body, including muscle
tissue and cells. Body protein can be converted to glucose or free fatty acids if
necessary, but the body’s preferred use of protein is in its basic units, amino acids.
Protein rarely contributes significantly to the energy needs of exercise (usually
it accounts for only 5 to 10 percent). Every gram of protein provides the body
with approximately four kilocalories.

Because they provide energy in the form of calories, carbohydrate, protein, and
fat are known as the energy-yielding nutrients. Vitamins, minerals, and water
provide no calories whatsoever, but they are essential to bone and muscle health
and overall body system integrity. Even more relevant is their role in enabling
the body to access (i.e., use) carbohydrate, protein, and fat when needed, such as
during exercise and recovery. Because of their critical role in energy production,
vitamins, minerals, and water are often referred to as catalysts. They improve
the efficiency of the chemical reactions that take place when the body needs to
use the energy-yielding nutrients to perform a given activity. The fancy word for
converting carbohydrate, protein, and fat to usable energy is bioenergetics, although
most swimmers and coaches know it as burning calories.
Burning calories is a literal description of accessing and using stored and
circulating nutrients for fuel, because all stored energy eventually degrades to
heat energy. The conversion of each of the energy-yielding nutrients produces
performance and heat. For reference, 1 kilocalorie is the amount of heat energy
needed to raise 1 kilogram of water by 1 degree Celsius. When accessed for fuel,
fat produces over twice as much energy as either carbohydrate or protein; 1 gram
of fat provides 9 kilocalories, more than either carbohydrate or protein (both
provide about 4 kcal per g).
The ability to access the energy-yielding nutrients is based on a number of fac-
tors: their availability in stored and circulating forms, the availability of catalysts,
the intensity and duration of the work being performed, and, subsequently, the
availability of oxygen. Oxygen availability is well established as a primary lim-
iting factor when it comes to exercise performance, which really means that an
energy cost is associated with exercise. This cost is directly related to intensity;
to the number of kilocalories per gram for carbohydrate, fat, and protein; and
to the way in which the body breaks down these nutrients to produce energy.
Figure 14.1 illustrates several key points related to how a healthy, well-nourished
swimmer needs and accesses fuel during exercise.
Let’s draw a couple of important observations from figure 14.1:
• The total number of calories (carbohydrate plus protein plus fat) required
to perform work (i.e., burned) increases with work intensity.
• Three sources of fuel are always contributing to the total caloric require-
ments of any workout. The relative contributions of these sources vary with
work intensity (Coyle et al. 1997).
• Fat contributes the most to total caloric requirements during exercise at low
intensity (Turcotte 1999). Fat is therefore the primary fuel source during
easy and moderate workouts.
• Carbohydrate contributes the most to total caloric requirements during
exercise of moderate to high intensity. Carbohydrate is thus the primary
fuel source during moderate to hard workouts (Coyle et al. 1997).
• The contribution of protein to total caloric requirements during exercise is
relatively small and unaffected by work intensity, provided that carbohydrate
and fat are available in sufficient quantities to support the work.

Note that a larger percentage of the energy to fuel performance at low
intensity comes from fat, whereas the largest contributor to fueling
performance at high intensity is carbohydrate.
Making the Connection
As mentioned previously, a swimmer’s desired training outcome can be achieved
through thoughtfully prescribed work that promotes a training response and
adaptation. Training programs that address the development of the aerobic and
anaerobic energy systems, fueling efficiency, muscle development, and neural
processes related to swimming performance include pool and dryland workouts
that are prescribed in quantities, intensities, and frequencies designed to
• enhance the ATP–CP renewal process (one component of anaerobic con-
ditioning),
• enhance the body’s ability to tolerate or delay the accumulation of lactic
acid (another component of anaerobic conditioning),
• enhance the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood (a component of aerobic
conditioning),
• enhance the size and number of mitochondria in working muscles (another
component of aerobic conditioning),
• improve the transmission of neural impulses that initiate movement (a
component of power), and optimize the size and effects of muscle fibers
(another component of power).
Conditioning all the energy systems and muscles to perform at their maximal
capacity enables swimmers to perform at their best. But one of the most under-
stated aspects of training is the fact that much of the adaptation that occurs in
response to training occurs during and in combination with rest and recovery.
Therefore, besides providing energy support, food provides the nutrients neces-
sary to repair, rebuild, and maintain muscle tissue, blood, bone, and immune
and nervous system elements that are taxed, stimulated, or jeopardized during
training. Inadequate nutrient availability during exercise and rest can compro-
mise the integrity of the immune, endocrine, and musculoskeletal systems in
general (Burke, Louks, and Broad 2006).

Fueling Is a Skill
Strong fundamental skills are essential in any sport, and fueling for performance
is no exception. Ensuring that the body has the nutrients it needs when it needs
them is definitely a skill, one that moves athletes and their support teams beyond
the concept of just counting calories. Fueling for performance is a matter of
significantly affecting the quality of the work performed, the quality of the rest
period, and ultimately the magnitude and direction of the adaptation and train-
ing response. A swimmer’s nutritional needs and bioenergetics will be affected
by that person’s training status, training phase, dietary status, and overall health
and state of mind (i.e., stress). Fueling for performance, therefore, is a matter
of maintaining a daily food and fluid routine that is sufficient and appropriate
in calories and nutrients taken at the appropriate times to support high-quality
training, promote optimal adaptations, and sustain overall health.
How Much of What Should I Eat
and Drink and When?
To maintain quality within the training program, a swimmer must learn to bal-
ance training-based fueling requirements with dietary intake. A healthy under-
standing and acknowledgment of how many calories are required to maintain
a healthy and efficient body weight and composition is an important first step
in ensuring this energy balance. The energy balance is the relationship between
calories consumed through diet and those expended through training and the
activities of daily living. Athletes can find themselves in one of three scenarios:
1. Positive energy balance: Energy intake is greater than energy expenditure.
2. Neutral energy balance: Energy intake equals energy expenditure.
3. Negative energy balance: Energy intake is less than energy expenditure.
Ignoring the role of energy balance can jeopardize a swimmer’s adaptation
to training and performance. For example, negative energy balance (i.e., when
energy intake is less than and therefore does not support energy output or energy
expended), forces the body to use an above-normal proportion of stored protein
for fuel during exercise. This use of protein can lead to a loss of lean tissue, includ-
ing muscle and its associated strength and endurance qualities (Burke, Louks, and
Broad 2006). Chronic negative energy balance can lead to nutrient deficiencies
and subsequent metabolic dysfunctions. Ultimately, these conditions become
a primary limiting factor on exercise quality and therefore training adaptation.
The 2009 joint position statement on nutrition and athletic performance,
published by the American Dietetic Association, Dietitians of Canada, and
American College of Sports Medicine (Rodriguez, DiMarco, and Langley 2009)
emphasizes the need for athletes to consume an amount of calories during
periods of high-intensity or long-duration training that maintains body weight

and health and maximizes training effects (neutral or slightly positive energy
balance). Calculating these caloric requirements can be difficult, and without
the guidance of a qualified professional, such as a board-certified specialist in
sports dietetics, it can become a source of frustration and stress. The most com-
monly used tool for determining the necessary caloric intake for an athlete is
the Harris-Benedict equation (Harris and Benedict 1919). Although the Harris-
Benedict equation dates back to the early 1900s, it is still reliable and practical,
and therefore it is widely used by sports dietitians to estimate basal metabolic
rate (BMR, the energy needed to sustain base bodily functions) and subsequently
determine an athlete’s total caloric expenditure.
Harris-Benedict equation for BMR, men
BMR = 66.5 + (13.75 × weight in kg) + (5.003 × height in cm)
− (6.775 × age in years)
or
BMR = 66 + (6.23 × weight in lb) + (12.7 × height in in.)
− (6.76 × age in years)
Harris-Benedict equation for BMR, women
BMR = 655.1 + (9.563 × weight in kg) + (1.850 × height in cm)
− (4.676 × age in years)
or
BMR = 655 + (4.35 × weight in lb) + (4.7 × height in in.)
− (4.7 × age in years)
Harris-Benedict equation for total energy expenditure, men and women
Daily energy expenditure = BMR × activity factor
where
Activity factor = 1.2 for little or no exercise
Activity factor = 1.375 for light exercise (one to three days per week)
Activity factor = 1.55 for moderate exercise (three to five days per week)
Activity factor = 1.725 for heavy exercise (six or seven days per week)
Activity factor = 1.9 for very heavy exercise (twice per day, extra heavy work-
outs)
Within-Day Energy Balance
So far, energy balance has been described in the context of a day. But equally impor-
tant is an athlete’s within-day energy balance (Duetz et al. 2000). Succumbing to
the pressures of time and weight management, many athletes, including swimmers,
suffer from an eating pattern characterized by oversized or infrequent morning

}
292 Boudreau
and afternoon meals and snacks, followed by a large meal at the end of a long
day. Through the physiology of food digestion, this pattern of eating promotes
dramatic fluctuations in blood sugar, which inevitably leads to difficulty with
body weight and composition management. The ideal scenario for an athlete is
one in which calories are consumed throughout the day in amounts and with
proper timing to offset the energy expended during training. Ironically, an
athlete’s desire to exert some control over body weight or composition is often
the trigger to seek negative energy balance. Like many other athletes, swim-
mers naturally and deliberately pursue negative energy balance when put under
pressure to lose weight or body fat. Without proper guidance and instruction,
swimmers who pursue performance improvements through body weight and fat
reduction can (and quite often do) easily and inadvertently compromise training
quality and improvement altogether (Maughan 2010).
An additional element, and often a more productive approach, to promoting
healthy and efficient body weight and composition involves discussions about
the foundations of good nutrition specific to consumption of performance-related
nutrients and its timing.
Energy-Yielding Nutrient Requirements
The roles and value of carbohydrate, protein, and fat in training and adaptation
are well established and accepted. Current research and practice still support the
use of the following daily intake recommendations for these macronutrients.
Break out your calculator, because the requirements tend to be based on an
athlete’s body weight, but take comfort in the fact that after you go through this
exercise several times, you will get a feel for how much food and what types of
food will get to the recommended amounts:
Carbohydrate: 6 to 10 grams per kilogram of body weight per day
Protein: 1.2 to 1.4 grams per kilogram of body weight per day, up to 1.7 grams
per kilogram of body weight per day
Fat: 20 to 35 percent of total energy intake per day
The ranges provided in these daily intake recommendations reinforce the
notion that all food and fluid routines for serious athletes must be based on
individual needs. Besides current training status, training phase, dietary status,
and overall health and state of mind, a swimmer’s individual needs can vary
with current biological age, gender, and training volume and intensity. Because
training volume and intensity are easily interpreted and tend to change more
readily and frequently than any of the other factors, it is practical to use them
to anchor the daily macronutrient requirements (see table 14.2).
Carbohydrate Intake
Most pool and dryland workouts tend to be in the moderate- to high-intensity
range, so carbohydrate serves as the swimmer’s primary training fuel source

(Stellingwerff and Boit 2007). The representation of carbohydrate in the media
and fad diet promotions, however, has undermined its importance in the athlete’s
diet. Consequently, these reports and this misinformation have led many athletes
and coaches to question its reputation. This circumstance is unfortunate because
besides its role as an energy-yielding nutrient, carbohydrate plays a number of
key roles in exercise physiology.
Adequate carbohydrate intake maintains glycogen stores and therefore main-
tains plasma and muscle glutamine levels. Glutamine is a fuel source for immune
system cells. Adequate carbohydrate intake keeps glutamine levels higher during
intense training and helps return levels to normal after exercise.
Adequate carbohydrate intake reduces the effects of the cortisol response to
exercise (Gleeson 2006). Cortisol is a stress hormone released in response to
physical and emotional pressure. Long term, cortisol can interfere with immune
system function and proper storage of the energy-yielding nutrients.
Ideally, carbohydrate during exercise is used to maintain blood sugar levels,
not to synthesize glutamine. Maintaining blood sugar levels during exercise
spares protein, allowing protein to be used for building rather than for fuel.
A diet low in carbohydrate and high in protein may create a condition of
acidosis, which requires buffering with glutamine, reducing glutamine’s avail-
ability and increasing long-term susceptibility to illness.
When carbohydrate reserves are low, the body turns to fat, increasing fat oxi-
dation and lipolysis. This process is facilitated by decreased levels of insulin and
increased levels of epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol, and growth hormone.
Note that although bread, cereal, rice, pasta, and potatoes are excellent sources
of carbohydrate, they should be balanced with other sources of carbohydrate,
such as colorful fruits and 100 percent juices, corn, sweet potato, yogurt, and
milk. Only then will the body also receive the appropriate mixture of vitamins
and minerals required to store and access carbohydrate efficiently.
Fat Intake
Besides reacting to rumors about carbohydrate, many athletes have a fear of
dietary fat and a corresponding tendency to place strict limits on dietary fat
intake. Some try to avoid dietary fat altogether. But fat is an essential part of the

--- Page 305 Text ---
}
294 Boudreau
athlete’s diet. The key is to understand the role of fat in the body and the way
to make healthy choices about its intake.
Fat provides the body with the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Some fat is
required in processes associated with growth, reproduction, and cell membrane
structuring. Some fat can offer protection against excessive loss of water and
damage from the sun’s radiation. Some fat must be supplied in fat-containing
foods because the human body cannot make it.
Fat gives food its taste. If all the fat were removed from beef, chicken, lamb,
and goat meat, it would be impossible to taste the differences between them. Fat
causes food to stay in the stomach longer, creating feelings of fullness. Some fat
in the diet can actually be a helpful element of a weight-loss strategy.
Fat is a concentrated source of energy. For athletes who have high daily caloric
requirements, fat can provide some of those calories in smaller amounts of food.
Without fat, some athletes would not be able to eat all the food needed to take
in the calories required.
All types of fat (saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated) provide nine
kilocalories per gram, but these different types of fat function differently after
they are inside the body. Saturated fat and cholesterol (a fatlike substance found
predominantly in animal products) tend to be associated with health problems,
whereas unsaturated fat, especially polyunsaturated fat, is generally recommended
in balanced quantities. Swimmers should feel comfortable and confident eating
healthy fat-containing foods such as olive oil, peanut butter, fish, and avocados.
Coaches and parents should not advocate a fat-free diet for any athlete.
Protein Intake
Because protein does not typically contribute as a fuel source during exercise, its
requirement in an athlete’s diet is based largely on the effects of the exercise on
the stored protein elements themselves. Therefore, when developing a workout,
the coach must consider the anchoring elements of training—training volume
and intensity—and assess how they will affect the body’s protein environment.
For example, a period of intense pool training accompanied by intense strength
training is typically associated with periods of muscle tissue breakdown, known
as catabolism. To optimize the desired training adaptations (gains in muscle mass
or function that translate to strength, power, and so on), the protein environ-
ment must limit the amount of time that the swimmer spends in the catabolic
state and promote a state of tissue repair and growth (anabolism).
The amount of dietary protein required to keep up with this magnitude of pro-
tein turnover will usually be close to the upper limit of the daily requirement, pos-
sibly near two grams per kilogram of body weight per day (Campbell et al. 2007).
Vitamin and Mineral Requirements
The most recent set of dietary recommendations established by the Food and
Nutrition Board of the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Institute of Medicine
and Health Canada are the dietary reference intakes (DRIs). Recent studies

--- Page 306 Text ---

Nutrition: Fueling for Performance 295
suggest that athletes from a variety of sports continue to consume less than
the recommended daily intake for folate, vitamin D, calcium, iron, potassium,
and magnesium (Knez and Peake 2010; Heaney et al. 2010) or practice “just in
case” vitamin supplementation for those nutrients, as well as the antioxidants
vitamin C and vitamin E (Knez and Peake 2010). Table 14.3 summarizes the
daily intake recommendations for various vitamins and minerals necessary for
health and swimming performance.

Although the vitamin and mineral needs of athletes may be slightly higher
than the DRI in some cases or at certain times of the year, research continues to
support the notion that the proportions of those needs are easily accounted for
within the higher energy intakes of athletes. Therefore, for athletes who consume
a calorically adequate and nutrient-rich diet and do not demonstrate signs of
nutritional deficiency, the practices of supplementation to improve performance
and “just in case” vitamin and mineral supplementation remain unwarranted
(Woolf and Manore 2006). But for a couple of vitamins and minerals, evidence
indicates that the risk of deficiency in certain swimmers remains high.
Special Considerations for Iron
Iron deficiency continues to be one of the most commonly detected and
addressed nutritional deficiencies in athletes (Haymes 2006). Characterized by
low available iron, low iron stores (low ferritin), poor iron use, low red blood cell
count, and low hemoglobin concentration, most cases of anemia are preceded
by a period of iron deficiency. Although iron deficiency itself does not affect
performance to a large degree, the low availability of iron and related markers
in the blood that accompanies anemia can have a significant detrimental effect
on performance. The physiology to exercise becomes unavailable, recovery suf-
fers, and training does not result in adaptation or improvement.
In swimmers, reports of iron stores well below the acceptable range (ferritin,
30 ng/ml for females, 35 ng/ml for males) are not uncommon. Ferritin, the
storage form of iron in the body, is a solid indicator of internal iron activity.
Although ferritin levels lower than 30 nanograms per milliliter are accept-
able in recreational athletes, competitive swimmers rely on adequate ferritin
levels to support regular extended endurance workouts, support double- and
triple-session training days, manage lactate accumulations, and experience the
physiological benefits of altitude training. A common symptom of anemia is
fatigue. Female swimmers may be at greater risk because of significant body
iron loss during menstruation and the consumption of smaller portions of
iron-rich foods, such as red meat, in an effort to maintain energy balance or
manage body weight. But male and female swimmers are equally susceptible
to iron loss in sweat and rapid growth, poor iron absorption, and low intake
of iron-rich foods in the diet.
Most athletes who suffer chronic iron deficiency or anemia require iron
supplementation, but only after confirmatory diagnosis by a physician. Although
maintaining adequate iron intake and ensuring adequate ferritin levels promotes
health, long-term elevations in body iron can be detrimental. Iron supplements
themselves can be toxic and ultimately deadly if a deficiency and a need for high
doses are not confirmed. Naturally elevated and prolonged high ferritin levels
can indicate a serious medical condition, such as hemochromatosis.
Anemia takes various forms, but most are related to poor dietary habits or
excessive blood loss through menstruation. The key to maintaining healthy
iron intake and stores is monitoring. Any athlete with inadequate iron in the

--- Page 308 Text ---

Nutrition: Fueling for Performance 297
diet or females who have heavy menstrual periods should have routine blood
tests to screen for iron deficiency anemia. Protein-rich foods such as red meat,
fish, poultry, legumes, and fortified cereals are excellent dietary sources of
iron that do not generally have the potential for toxicity that iron supplements
can present when taken without the guidance and instruction of a qualified
sport dietitian or physician. Children should never have access to iron supple-
ments.
Special Considerations for Vitamin D
Unlike iron deficiency, vitamin D deficiency does not receive the attention it
probably deserves in the minds of athletes (Holick 2007; Vieth et al. 2007; Willis,
Peterson, and Larson-Myer 2008). Although the risk of vitamin D deficiency is
likely higher only for swimmers who train in indoor pools rather than outdoor
pools, vitamin D is a dietary requirement for all athletes. The complication is
that the variety of foods that supply it is limited.
Most people meet at least some of their vitamin D requirement through expo-
sure to sunlight. Although vitamin D deficiency is rare in the general population,
swimmers whose sun exposure is limited should consider making an extra effort
to ensure a regular intake of foods that contain this nutrient, which is vital to
supporting calcium and bone health. Some have suggested that this recommen-
dation is especially important in a sport in which a large portion of the exercise
is non-weight-bearing. Because of the integration of turns and dryland workouts
into the sport, evidence to support this point is not conclusive.
Water and Hydration
Exercise raises body temperature, even in the pool. Fortunately, sweating offers an
efficient way to remove excess heat from the body. Swimmers have been reported
to sweat at a rate of 0.37 liters per hour (Cox et al. 2002). Although swimmers
may sweat at a rate much lower than athletes in other sports do (Sawka et al.
2007), the effects of hydration and dehydration are no less important. Because
the body produces heat and sweat in response to work, the blood must respond
by delivering nutrients to exercising muscles, transporting metabolic by-products
for removal, and delivering sweat to the skin. Over time, if sweating continues
over the course of a two-hour workout, for example, total body fluid decreases,
leading to a condition of dehydration. Any sweat loss from the body also removes
electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, and chloride from the body.
Research suggests that dehydration from body fluid loss that results in a loss
of body weight of more than 2 percent impairs aerobic exercise performance and
mental agility, especially in a warm environment (Casa, Clarkson, and Roberts
2005; Cheuvront, Carter, and Sawka 2003).
To limit dehydration, swimmers are encouraged to incorporate hydration
practices into the daily dietary routine. They should hydrate before, during, and
after workouts according to the guidelines presented in table 14.4.

& Science in Sports & Exercise 39(2): 377–390.
The purpose of drinking fluids during exercise is twofold:
1. To maintain adequate body fluid to help blood disperse heat and transport
nutrients
2. To provide a source of fuel that will help maintain mental agility (because
the brain relies heavily on blood sugar for fuel) and spare protein
Although water alone may accomplish the first objective, it cannot provide
additional fuel. Carbohydrate-electrolyte drinks with carbohydrate content
between 6 and 8 percent (by weight) are ideal. This concentration is low enough
to promote fluid absorption in the gastrointestinal tract yet strong enough to
deliver sugar to the bloodstream in a quantity that is effective in supporting the
working body’s use of carbohydrate as a fuel source, thereby sparing protein.
Timing Is Everything, and Recovery is Critical
Fueling for performance is a skill that athletes must practice. For swimmers,
maintaining energy balance during a typical training day means keeping up
with multiple fluctuations in energy demand and energy expenditure that
accompany training. Eating in response to hunger (not a skill) is not enough to
ensure adequate fuel sources and energy balance within each training day and
throughout entire training cycles. Competitive swimmers must take eating to
a more sophisticated level and become proactive with their eating plans and
patterns. Eating must become a practiced skill. Similar to hydrating, fueling
requires eating before, during, and after workouts.
Before a workout, ordinary meals and snacks should prepare a swimmer for
the pending activity. More specifically, food and fluid taken during the four-hour
period before exercise should combine carbohydrate and protein in such a way
that the swimmer feels satisfied at the onset of the workout (i.e., no hunger, no

Nutrition: Fueling for Performance 299
undigested food in the stomach, no gastrointestinal distress). During a work-
out, the purpose of fueling is to provide a source of fuel that will help maintain
mental agility, maintain blood sugar levels, improve performance quality, and
spare protein. Despite perfect fueling during workouts, some accumulation of
tissue damage is inevitable with high-level training. Therefore, replenishing
fuel stores after every workout is critical to maintaining energy reserves from
one workout to the next and limiting the amount of tissue damage over time
(Rowlands et al. 2008; Koopman et al. 2007). A quality workout relies on the
replenishment of fuel stores and hydration levels reduced during previous ses-
sions. This replenishment is most critical during the first 20 to 120 minutes after
the workout. Table 14.5 provides an overview of fueling schedule recommenda-
tions and guidelines for swimmers.

by the environment resulting from the integration of available protein, carbohy-
drate, fat, vitamins, minerals, and water during rest and recovery (Burke 2010;
Maughan 2010). The 2009 joint position statement on nutrition and athletic

recovery. A carbohydrate intake of 1.0–1.5 g/kg body weight (0.5–0.7 g/lb)
during the first 30 min and again every 2 h for 4 to 6 h will be adequate
to replace glycogen stores. Protein consumed after exercise will provide
amino acids for the building and repair of muscle tissue. (Rodriguez,
DiMarco, and Langley 2009, p. 710)
Table 14.6 provides a collection of recovery food ideas, most of which match
the recommendations established by ACSM, ADA, and Dietitians of Canada.
Special Considerations for Competition and Travel
A swimmer’s individual fueling routine should include fueling on the road. Even
swimmers who follow excellent performance-based nutrition programs at home
face certain fueling challenges on the road. The most practical recommendation
for getting the right foods while on the road involves being prepared with back-
up snacks and drinks from home, as well as being proactive in learning what
type of food arrangements will be available at the destination (dining halls,
restaurants, grocers, delis, convenience marts). Swimmers are advised to check
with competition hosts or their event team managers for information about food
arrangements. Lots of nutrition information for restaurants is available online.

A little research will help identify opportunities for individualized meals, special
food substitutes, and special food preparations. Competition fueling should be
part of the routine, not a new experiment!
Traveling to Altitude
Training and competing high above sea level present a unique set of nutrition-
related challenges. Altitude decreases the partial pressure of inhaled oxygen
(PO) in the lungs. When this pressure forcing air from the lungs into the blood-
i 2
stream decreases, so too does the amount of oxygen reaching (saturating) the
blood. Within 24 hours of altitude exposure, the body recognizes this change
in oxygen availability and begins forming new red blood cells to compensate for
the decline in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. One of the ingredients
in forming new red blood cells is ferritin, which again ties into the importance
of maintaining adequate iron stores in the body.
Besides the physiological changes, travel to altitude is often associated with
training camps and competitions involving higher-than-usual activity levels,
harder workouts or more intense performances, and meals offered at restaurants
or large dining halls. Swimmers can prepare for the potential effects of altitude
during training camps and competitions by following several simple guidelines
both before and during the training or event:
Before traveling to altitude
• Make healthy eating and drinking strategies at home routine. Adequate and
stable hydration and nutrition status allows the body to deal with initial
altitude exposure and to adjust during the visit.
• Get any asthma-related or other breathing restrictions or tendencies
addressed and under control.
• Include iron-rich foods in daily food choices at home to help stabilize iron
stores. Examples of iron-rich foods are red meat, shrimp, fish, beans, peas,
whole grains, tofu, dark leafy greens, and fortified cereals.
• Prepare mentally and physically for the common initial symptoms of expo-
sure and plan the first few days of the visit accordingly. Anticipating the side
effects makes them seem less dramatic when they are actually experienced.
During the altitude visit
• Stay hydrated. Drink fluids intermittently before, during, and after workouts.
Avoid alcohol and limit caffeine.
• Eat plenty of carbohydrate, protein, and iron by including bread, pasta,
fruit or fruit juice, meat, fish, milk, yogurt, beans, and dark salads in daily
food choices.
• Be smart about fat by choosing healthy fat sources such as olive oil, nuts,
avocados, and peanut butter and avoid wasteful fat sources such as french
fries, pie, ice cream, and alfredo sauce.

• Get enough rest. Adequate sleep during the night and short naps during
the day can decrease stress hormones and promote recovery and tissue
regeneration.
Swimmers staying at altitude more than five days who seek to experience the
physiological benefits of altitude training should consider an iron status screen-
ing by a physician or health care center before the start of the training camp. An
iron status check typically includes a profile of a complete blood count (CBC),
serum iron, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and ferritin. Ferritin levels greater
than or equal to 30 nanograms per milliliter for females or greater than or equal
to 35 nanograms per milliliter for males are considered adequate. Note: This
testing will be useful only if it is done at least six weeks before the altitude visit
because even a mild deficiency can take at least six weeks to correct.
Performance-Centered Nutrition
and Disordered Eating
Despite the tremendous amount of educational material available and the many
avenues through which this information is disseminated, disordered eating
continues to challenge many athletes whose sports carry a strong aesthetic
element (Beals and Hill 2006). Swimmers are not alone in battling unhealthy
eating behaviors as well as the internal and external pressures they experience
in trying to mold themselves to the expectations and perceptions of what it
means to be an athlete today. Although clinicians agree that disordered eating is
psychologically based, the fact remains that restricting foods, binging, purging,
using laxatives and diet pills, and engaging in compulsive or excessive exercise
are nutrition related. Unfortunately, these issues often stem from an athlete’s
desire to lose weight in the name of appearance, and the behaviors may have
little to do with performance in the pool.
The challenges for athletes who, unguided and unsupervised, attempt to lose
weight or change body composition for the sake of appearance include such
things as
• inadequate caloric intake (negative energy balance),
• overreliance on protein and fat and underreliance on carbohydrate,
• too many dietary substitutes such as dietary supplements or ergogenic aids,
• poor recovery,
• failure to practice eating and drinking in a manner that supports health
and performance, and
• failure to plan daily food intake.
Although the desired physical changes may be realized, the integrated collec-
tion of physiological consequences can be devastating to a swimmer’s perfor-
mance: loss of metabolic muscle mass, lower metabolic rate (i.e., lower ability

to burn calories), lower endurance, poor recovery, and a higher risk of injury,
illness, and complications associated with nutrient deficiencies.
Addressing these challenges requires solid acceptance of the facts: Appear-
ance is important, nutrition affects performance, food is fuel and should not
be feared, chronic undereating slows metabolism, and nutrition can and should
be planned to support performance. After all, everything that swimmers do in
training is focused on performance, so nutrition should be too. Performance-
centered nutrition incorporates the foundations of sport nutrition with the
elements of sport performance:
• Eat a variety of foods from all the food groups. There are no magic foods or
food groups for enhancing performance or losing or gaining weight.
• Eat colorful foods, especially during recovery. Vitamins give fruits and
vegetables their bright colors. Always have at least two brightly colored
fruits or vegetables on the dinner plate. Take advantage of the postexercise
insulin response to replenish glycogen, attenuate tissue breakdown, and
promote tissue accretion.
• Eat enough, frequently, and don’t get hungry. Eat foods that support daily
training requirements in terms of total energy, fuel sources, and metabolic
catalysts. Obtain calories from sources that enhance metabolism and
minimize waste and unnecessary hormonal responses. Avoid restricting
calories by more than 10 to 20 percent of normal intake. Avoid dropping
fat intake to less than 15 percent of total daily caloric intake. Time calorie
intake to maximize use and storage. Hunger is a sign of an energy deficit
and possible hormonal fluctuation. A healthy approach is to eat smaller
meals and several snacks throughout the day, feeding the body every three
to four hours, even on competition days.
• Drink enough, often enough, and don’t get thirsty. Thirst is a sign of existing
dehydration, which can impair mental and physical performance.
Summary
The best nutrition plan is the one most tailored to the unique needs of the indi-
vidual swimmer. These needs are a function of age, gender, body size, training,
and food preferences and tolerances. Performance-centered nutrition reflects a
flexible, achievable, and sustainable approach to eating that allows athletes to
overcome nutrition- and food-related challenges that can increase mental stress.
Adopting a healthy and practical approach to weight management can help
swimmers achieve the healthiest balance among body weight, body composi-
tion, food, and athletic performance.

CHAPTER
Performance Enhancers
and Doping Control
—Jennifer L. Reed, PhD, MEd CS, and Andrew L. Pipe, CM, MD
No presentation of factors affecting elite swimming performance would be
complete without a discussion of approaches to performance enhancement.
All competitors have the laudable goal of enhancing their abilities, skills, and
performance. In the pages that follow, we identify and review a series of meth-
ods that have been reputed to enhance performance, and we identify those that
have been proved effective. We cannot stress enough that optimal approaches to
training involve careful attention to the fundamental principles of nutrition—not
exotic, unproven dietary practices—in association with the recognition that rest
and recovery are essential elements of any training program. Success most often
occurs by paying careful, methodical attention to the seemingly mundane, not
by seeking the miraculous!
Performance enhancers, in our discussion, involve the use of substances,
methods, or other phenomena. They have included warm-up exercises, hypnosis,
stress management techniques, music, motivational strategies, nutritional prac-
tices, oxygen inhalation, application of extrinsic biomechanical aids, and other
approaches thought likely to improve training or competitive performance. In
this chapter we critically examine a number of commonly employed nutritional
supplements. We emphasize that a remarkably low level of evidence supports
the use of many of these highly advertised, often costly products whose use may
also pose significant risk to competitive swimmers.
At the same time we realize that some people seek to enhance performance
using illicit techniques. We recognize that an examination of issues surrounding
doping and doping control is also of interest to those in the swimming community.
We thank Joshua Stern and Shain Thakrar, medical students at the University of Ottawa, for their
assistance in preparing this chapter.

Unfortunately, prohibited approaches have compromised fair competition in
swimming and have included the use of drugs, hematological manipulations,
and other illicit methodologies. The use of foreign substances to enhance per-
formance is an age-old practice that dates back to ancient Greece, to a time
when athletes used special diets and stimulating potions in attempts to enhance
athletic performance. In this chapter we discuss antidoping rule violations in
elite swimming, comment on doping behaviors among athletes and coaches,
and discuss new advances in doping education and control. We discuss aids
related to aerobic performance (e.g., blood doping) and anaerobic performance
(e.g., blood buffering) and prohibited drugs (e.g., anabolic steroids, B -agonists).

Nutritional Supplements
Nutritional supplementation is a common practice among elite athletes (Juhn
2003; Maughan, King, and Lea 2004). It has been noted that 65 percent of
Canadian Olympic athletes at the Atlanta and Sydney Olympic Games and 89
percent of American collegiate-level athletes reported using nutritional supple-
ments as part of their training regimens (Froiland et al. 2004; Huang, Johnson,
and Pipe 2006). Supplement use reflects popular trends. New supplements,
often highly publicized and luridly advertised, emerge in the marketplace and
become popular, while others lose their luster and disappear altogether. From
the outset, it is important to note that the scientific evidence supporting the use
of most supplement products is limited or nonexistent. Nevertheless, supple-
ments are heavily advertised, frequently employing scientific-sounding and
highly exaggerated claims!
Nutritional supplements may be consumed in an attempt to manage large
training volumes, maximize recovery, increase energy levels, reduce fatigue,
increase strength, overcome muscle cramps, avoid illness, boost immune func-
tion, maintain good health, and improve performance (Juhn 2003; Maughan,
King, and Lea 2004; Dascombe et al. 2010). Supplements may also be con-
sumed because of sponsorship agreements and endorsement obligations, travel
requirements, recommendations of peers or influential figures, or as part of a
self-established routine (Dascombe et al. 2010).
Numerous supplementation practices have been reported among elite swim-
mers including the consumption of caffeine, sports drinks, isotonic drinks,
vitamins, minerals, multivitamins, antioxidants, herbal preparations, glucos-
amine, iron, creatine, protein-carbohydrate mixes, amino acids (protein), garlic,
horse radish, fish oil, carnitine, conjugated linoleic acid, cytochrome, inosine,
ginseng, bee pollen, oxygenated water, vanadium, coenzyme Q10, pyruvate,
dimethylglycine, and bicarbonate (Dascombe et al. 2010; Baylis, Cameron-
Smith, and Burke 2001; Zenic et al. 2010; Rodriguez, DiMarco, and Langley
2009; Momaya, Fawal, and Estes 2015). Sports drinks provide an appropriate
source of energy and nutrients to meet the nutritional needs of training and
competition. The principal reason for the consumption of sports drinks is to

--- Page 318 Text ---
|
Performance Enhancers and Doping Control 307
increase energy intake (Lun et al. 2012; Slater, Tan, and Teh 2003). Although
appropriate energy intake is important because inadequate energy levels can
impair swimming performance (Vanheest et al. 2014), for most swimmers com-
peting in short events the ongoing administration of calories (the most common
ingredient of sport drinks) is largely unnecessary. Multivitamins and vitamin C
are reported as the most popular vitamin supplements used by elite swimmers
(Baylis, Cameron-Smith, and Burke 2001); echinacea has been reported as the
most common herbal product consumed by swimmers (Baylis, Cameron-Smith,
and Burke 2001). Antioxidant supplementation may have a role (vitamin C and
E) during periods of adaptation to increased training stress (Baylis, Cameron-
Smith, and Burke 2001). But no conclusive proof of health benefits or enhanced
performance is available, and any improvement in performance is likely to be
small and mediated by the placebo effect (Baylis, Cameron-Smith, and Burke
2001). The body maintains exquisite control over the level of many vitamins, so
an increased intake of water-soluble vitamins is immediately met with an increase
in the excretion of that same vitamin, leading to the sarcastic observation that
many athletes produce the most nutritious urine in the world!
Despite the number of readily available supplements and the number of elite
swimmers who consume these products, there is limited data to suggest that
nutritional supplements (e.g., vitamins and minerals) enhance performance
(Rodriguez, DiMarco, and Langley 2009; Volpe 2007). Moreover, the production
and marketing of the vast majority of nutritional supplements is unregulated.
Athletes risk the inadvertent ingestion of prohibited substances which may be
often added to these products without any identification of their presence on
the label. Such incidents occur with increasing frequency on a worldwide basis.
Supplement use comes with little evidence of benefit—there are some excep-
tions—and considerable risk (Outram and Stewart 2015; Maughan 2013; Judkins
and Prock 2012; King et al. 2012).
Elite swimmers typically seek information from a variety of sources when
deciding whether to take a supplement. The role of self-styled nutritional gurus,
strength and conditioning coaches, and others with little formal training in
nutritional science can be problematic. For many, nutrition is more a religion
than a science, and, tragically, each year a significant number of competitors
in a variety of sports are found to have ingested prohibited substances because
of the ill-advised use of nutritional supplements. Although dietitians, doctors,
pharmacists, nutritionists, sport scientists, coaches, and naturopaths are often
thought to be the principal sources of information for athletes when they consider
whether to take a supplement (Dascombe et al. 2010; Baylis, Cameron-Smith,
and Burke 2001; Zenic et al. 2010; Sajber et al. 2013), it is frequently noted that
athletes are more likely to discuss supplement use with the staff of health food
shops, herbalists, supplement salespersons, peers, family, and friends (Huang,
Johnson, and Pipe 2006; Dascombe et al. 2010; Zenic et al. 2010). This circum-
stance is a concern because many such individuals lack in-depth knowledge
regarding nutritional supplements. Sadly, nutritional scientists and dietitians

--- Page 319 Text ---
}
308 Reed and Pipe
are less frequently consulted or heeded! Misinformation regarding nutritional
supplementation places athletes at a higher risk of positive doping violations.
The billion-dollar nutritional supplement industry is almost completely unregu-
lated in the United States, the source of a substantial proportion of the world’s
nutritional supplement products. The nature of the ingredients, labeling prac-
tices, quality controls, and manufacturing and marketing processes surrounding
these products is generally open to suspicion. Inadvertent doping occurs when
an athlete records a positive drug test after ingesting a banned substance as an
unrecognized ingredient of such products. Many cases occur because of the
consumption of products by unsuspecting athletes who have followed the advice
of perhaps well-intentioned, but frequently ill-informed, advisors or coaches.
Most countries have national antidoping organizations (NADOs) that pro-
vide education and guidance to athletes regarding the use of medications and
supplements. But in most instances there is no way to guarantee the safety or
contents of nutritional products from countries (most commonly the United
States) where the supplement industry is unregulated. Athletes assume abso-
lute liability for anything they place in their bodies, and antidoping sanctions
are typically applied in cases in which a prohibited substance is detected even
though it was consumed, in error, in a supplement. Sadly, competitors can be
disqualified from sport and face public humiliation as a doping athlete fol-
lowing the consumption of a contaminated nutritional supplement (Baylis,
Cameron-Smith, and Burke 2001). All athletes must be aware of the risks of
using nutritional supplements.
Unfortunately, some researchers have noted that few elite swimmers (less
than 4 percent) believe that their sport is doping free (Sajber e al. 2013). A
recent report suggested that one in five swimmers would use doping products if
they would ensure sport success without negative health consequences (Zenic
et al. 2010). Swimmers who believe that doping practices are commonplace in
their sport are more likely to have a tendency toward doping usage (Zenic et
al. 2010). Approaches that would create a competitive environment in which
doping behavior is seen by athletes as being socially unacceptable are important
in the fight against doping.
Caffeine
Caffeine is a substance, not prohibited, that most adults consume daily. The
widely available foods, drinks, and nonprescription medications that contain
caffeine have increased the opportunities for athletes to consume caffeine as an
ergogenic (performance-enhancing) aid. Table 15.1 shows the caffeine content
of common foods, drinks, and nonprescription preparations (Burke 2008; caf-
feineinformer 2014).
The effects of caffeine in reducing fatigue and increasing wakefulness are well
documented (Burke 2008). In healthy adults, moderate caffeine intake of up
to 400 milligrams per day (6 mg per kg of body weight) is not associated with
adverse effects (Burke 2008).

Caffeine was removed from the World Anti-Doping Agency’s (WADA’s) list
of prohibited substances and methods in part because of its widespread, global
presence in a variety of commonly consumed foodstuffs and beverages. Ath-
letes are therefore able to consume caffeine either in their diets or for specific
performance-enhancing purposes. Caffeine levels in the urine samples collected
in the course of doping controls are monitored carefully by the WADA to detect
patterns of misuse in sport. Caffeine is on the list of restricted substances (urine
samples exceeding 15 micrograms per ml of caffeine) for the National Collegiate
Athletic Association (NCAA).
The habitual social intake of caffeine and its specific use in relation to a train-
ing session may benefit elite swimming by prolonging an athlete’s capacity to
undertake the physical and mental components of a workout (Burke 2008). Sev-
eral researchers have examined the effect of caffeine on swimming (Burke 2008;

--- Page 321 Text ---
}
310 Reed and Pipe
MacIntosh and Wright 1995). Caffeine has been shown to enhance performance
in sustained high-intensity swimming events lasting from 1 to 20 minutes (Burke
2008). In controlled research trials involving 1,500-meter freestyle swimming,
caffeine ingestion (6 mg per kg of body weight) resulted in faster performance
times (23-second improvement) in an event that is completed in less than 25
minutes (MacIntosh and Wright 1995). Further, caffeine ingestion (205 mg; 4 mg
per kg of body weight) 60 minutes before 100-meter swim races leads to enhanced
swim velocity (meters per second) in trained swimmers (Collomp et al. 1992).
Caffeine appears to mediate improvements in performance through increased
lipolysis (lipid breakdown) and fat oxidation, decreased muscle glycogen break-
down (Kovacs, Stegen, and Brouns 1998; Cole et al. 1996; Costill, Dalsky, and
Fink 1978; Ivy et al. 1979), and lessening of the subjective perception of effort
(Ivey et al. 1979). Not generally appreciated is that individual sensitivity to and
metabolism of caffeine can vary widely. Beyond a certain intake, symptoms of
caffeinism such as irritability, restlessness, and agitation may develop, possibly
reducing performance capacity.
Blood Buffers
Bicarbonate is generally thought to provide a definite benefit to sport perfor-
mance when used in a specific protocol for a specific event (Baylis, Cameron-
Smith, and Burke 2001). In short-term, all-out performance in which nonoxi-
dative energy sources provide most of the energy for muscle contraction, the
focus of attention shifts to the buffering of hydrogen ions (H+) released from
the muscle. Elevations in H+ in muscle can decrease the activity of phospho-
fructokinase (PFK), which may slow the breakdown of glucose, a muscle fuel;
interfere with excitation-contraction coupling events by reducing Ca++ efflux
from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, impairing muscle function (Fuchs, Reddy,
and Briggs 1970); and reduce binding of Ca++ to troponin, further impairing
muscle function (Nakamaru and Schwartz 1972). Not surprisingly, therefore,
decreases in muscle force development have been linked to increases in muscle
H+ (Tesch et al. 1978).
The primary means by which H+ is buffered during exercise is through its
reaction with the plasma bicarbonate reserves to form carbonic acid, which
subsequently yields carbon dioxide (CO) that is exhaled during normal respira-
2
tion. As bicarbonate stores decrease, the ability to buffer H+ is reduced and the
plasma H+ increases, producing a state of acidosis (Powers and Howley 2012).
Systemic alkalosis (decreased H+ concentration) induced through the ingestion
of bicarbonate has been shown to improve exercise performance and delay the
onset of fatigue (Lindh et al. 2008; Mero et al. 2004). The findings of Lindh
et al. (2008) revealed that 200-meter swim performance time was faster after
consuming sodium bicarbonate (300 mg per kg of body mass) than in control
or placebo conditions (1:52.2 ± 4.7 sodium bicarbonate; 1:53.7 ± 3.8 control;
1:54.0 ± 3.6 placebo; min:ss; p < 0.05). Mero et al. (2004) demonstrated that
combining sodium bicarbonate and creatine supplementation (0.3 grams per kg

--- Page 322 Text ---
|
Performance Enhancers and Doping Control 311
of body weight) enhances interval swimming performance in elite swimmers
(100-meter freestyle swims) by 0.9 seconds when compared with the adminis-
tration of a placebo.
The use of blood buffers to induce alkalosis is not without risk. Large doses
of sodium bicarbonate can cause diarrhea and vomiting, which can obviously
have an adverse effect on performance.
Creatine
Creatine (methyl guanidine acetic acid) supplementation is a common practice
among elite swimmers (de Silva et al. 2010). Creatine supplements were first
brought to broad public attention following the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona.
Annual worldwide consumption of creatine is estimated at more than 2.7 million
kilograms (Baylis, Cameron-Smith, and Burke 2001). Creatine is synthesized
by the body, and it plays an important role in energy metabolism. Inside the
muscle cell, creatine is phosphorylated to generate phosphocreatine (PCr), an
energy substrate that undergoes dephosphorylation to resynthesize adenosine
triphosphate (ATP) from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in the following reaction:
PCr + ADP + H+ ↔ Cr + ATP
The degree to which skeletal muscles use PCr in the regeneration of ATP (a
principal source of muscle energy in short-duration activity) depends on exercise
intensity and duration. The breakdown of ATP in muscle cells releases energy
for muscular contraction. The supply of PCr is limited; total combined ATP and
PCr stores are capable of sustaining all-out maximal effort for 5 to 10 seconds.
Fatigue may be attributed to the rapid decrease in PCr and a diminished rate of
ATP regeneration (Silva et al. 2007).
Creatine supplementation has been shown to increase resting concentrations
of creatine in skeletal muscle, which consequently increases PCr concentrations
by 12 to 18 percent (Juhn 2003; Branch 2003), thus facilitating regeneration of
ATP during intense exercise. Typical creatine supplementation practices involve
oral creatine intakes of 20 grams per day for five days as a loading dose, followed
by 5 grams per day as a maintenance dose. But athletes often take more than
needed. Two grams per day is enough to maintain optimally elevated creatine
concentration in skeletal muscle (Juhn 2003). Many athletes are nonresponders,
and the administration of creatine produces no discernible benefit. Creatine is
typically found in certain animal proteins, so those with an inadequate intake
of dietary creatine are more likely to derive additional benefit from its ingestion.
The generation of peak nonoxidative power and nonoxidative capacity during
short-term, high-intensity exercise may depend on endogenous levels of ATP and
PCr. An increase in total muscle PCr through exogenous creatine supplementa-
tion may provide an ergogenic effect by enhancing the rate of ATP synthesis
during this type of exercise.
Performance enhancements observed in laboratory experiments may not be
present during actual swimming activities. The literature is conflicting regarding

--- Page 323 Text ---
}
312 Reed and Pipe
the effect of creatine supplementation on swimming performance. The incon-
sistencies in the literature about the effects of oral creatine supplementation on
either performance or body composition may result from the variety of protocols
(number of grams, number of days, time between dosing and event) used or
groups of participants (trained, untrained, males, or females) used to investigate
the effects (Silva et al. 2007). Some studies have reported improved swimming
performance (Peyrebrune et al. 2005), but others have reported no influence of
creatine supplementation in either a single swim situation or repeated interval
swimming bouts (Silva et al. 2007). For example, creatine supplementation when
compared with placebo supplementation has not been shown to improve swim-
ming performance in events less than 150 seconds in duration (Branch 2003).
Creatine is osmotically active—it draws water into the tissues in which it is
found in excess—leading to slightly swollen muscles, weight gain, heavier limbs,
changed hydrodynamics, and increased drag. These latter features may explain
why in sports in which it is necessary to propel oneself through or over the
water (swimming and rowing), creatine use has frequently failed to show any
performance-enhancing benefits (Juhn 2003). This increased quantity of water
in the muscle of creatine users also explains why creatine supplementation has
been found to cause a significant increase in total and lean body mass; average
increases were 1.2 ± 0.3% and 2.2 ± 0.7%, respectively (Branch 2003). Creatine
supplementation has been found to improve the performance of specific isolated
tasks such as isotonic lifting (rapid repetitions), isometric exercise, leg ergometer
power, and other forms of work that primarily use nonoxidative glycolysis as
a principal energy source (Branch 2003). The ergogenic potential of creatine
supplementation diminishes with increasing duration of activity (Branch 2003).
Other documented adverse effects of creatine supplementation include
increased muscle compartment pressure, which has the potential to impair blood
flow in certain muscle groups. Because skeletal muscle has a threshold beyond
which no more creatine can be stored, athletes should be informed that more is
not better. In fact, increasing levels of creatine ingestion are associated with an
increased incidence of adverse effects (Juhn 2003). Gastrointestinal disturbances
and muscle cramps are frequent and common side effects of creatine intake.
Dietary Nitrate
In recent years, considerable interest has been directed to the use of nitrate and
its role in enhancing the efficiency of muscle contraction. Evidence is accumulat-
ing that the ingestion of nitrates or beetroot juice (which is nitrate rich) rapidly
increases the levels of nitrite and enhances the production of nitric oxide, a
potent regulator of muscle blood flow (Vanhatalo et al. 2010; Larsen et al. 2007,
2010). The result appears to be an increase in muscle efficiency and a reduction
in muscular oxygen consumption during a maintained level of power output
(Larsen et al. 2010). Investigators have demonstrated that beetroot juice ingestion
increases endurance exercise capacity (Bailey et al. 2009, 2010). Consequently,
the consumption of this product has soared in many athletic circles. An increase

--- Page 324 Text ---
|
Performance Enhancers and Doping Control 313
in the level of nitric oxide can also be induced by the consumption of l-arginine,
and its use has been associated with improved muscular efficiency (Bailey et al.
2010). The evidence of the health benefits of nitrate ingestion continues to grow,
but at the same time it is acknowledged that overdosing with these agents may
have health consequences (Archer 2002; Derave and Taes 2009).
Amino Acids and Beta-Alanine
Protein and amino acids, the building blocks of protein, play an important
role in the development of strength. Elite swimmers commonly use these sport
supplements (Paschoal and Amancio 2004). Athletes have a greater daily protein
requirement than sedentary individuals do. The recommended dietary allow-
ance of protein is 0.8 gram per kilogram of body weight per day for adults, but
for athletes it ranges from 1.2 to 1.7 grams per kilogram of body weight per day;
the higher values are reserved for strength athletes (American College of Sports
Medicine 2013). Despite recognition of the additional protein needs of athletes,
most athletes eat well enough to achieve an appropriate dietary intake; there
is little convincing evidence to support additional consumption of protein or
amino acids as performance enhancers (Juhn 2003). Excess protein or amino
acid intake may lead to adverse health outcomes such as increased urinary cal-
cium excretion, which may compromise bone mineralization, especially in elite
swimmers who typically present with bone mineral densities lower than those
of endurance or strength athletes (Paschoal and Amancio 2004).
Interest continues to grow about the effectiveness of beta-alanine, an amino
acid that appears to increase muscle levels of carnosine, an intracellular buffer,
thereby enhancing performance in situations in which muscle acidity increases
because of exercise. Much of the research surrounding the effectiveness of many
nutritional supplements has involved an examination of the effects of these sub-
stances in improving performance in nonelite participants. Beta-alanine is no
different in this respect, and many of the studies evaluating its effectiveness have
no clear relevance to high-performance sport. A carefully constructed examina-
tion of the effect of beta-alanine supplementation on swimming performance
involving elite competitors failed to identify any performance benefits following
10 weeks of beta-alanine supplementation (4.8 grams per day over a four-week
loading phase, 3.2 grams per day during a six-week maintenance phase) (Chung
et al. 2012). Similar results have been reported in an investigation involving elite
400-meter runners (Derave et al. 2007). The initial evidence of the ergogenic
potential of this agent in the laboratory setting has not been replicated in the
swimming pool or on the track.
Remember the Basics
Although numerous supplements are aggressively marketed, the majority making
astounding claims, most have little or no effect on performance. Elite swimmers
need to remember the basics: optimal energy, iron, and folate levels.

Energy Levels
The goal of training is to produce physical adaptations to achieve a higher level
of athletic performance. High training loads (exercise energy expenditure)
demand greater energy intake to maintain energy balance. The maintenance of
energy balance has long been theorized as an essential component of maximal
performance. In a recent report, Vanheest and colleagues (2014) demonstrated
that significant decrements in performance in elite junior national-caliber female
swimmers during a 12-week competitive season were associated with chronic
ovarian suppression because of inadequate energy intake. Rigorous approaches
to caloric restriction to limit weight gain frequently produce distinct changes in
normal hormonal fluxes (Reed et al. 2011; Reed, De Souza, and Williams 2013)
and decrements in performance (Vanheest et al. 2014; Gibbs et al. 2013; Gibbs
et al. 2011). Women with subtle ovarian suppression and long menstrual cycles
(oligomenorrhea) experienced reductions in sport performance as measured by
a 400-meter swim time trial. In fact, sport performance declined by 9.8 percent
in females with ovarian suppression, whereas performance improved by 8.2
percent in females with normal menstrual cycles. Communication of this mes-
sage to coaches and athletes is essential because many people promote energy-
restricting practices with the goal of improving performance (Vanheest et al.
2014). Adequate energy intake is also needed to reduce the risk for nutritional
repartition that can lead to impaired menstrual, bone, and cardiovascular health
(Reed et al. 2011; Nattiv et al. 2007; O’Donnell, Goodman, and Harvey 2011;
De Souza et al. 2007, 2008; Hoch et al. 2011; Reed et al. 2015).
Iron and Folate
Iron is required for the formation of oxygen-carrying protein, hemoglobin, and
myoglobin, and for enzymes involved in energy production (Rodriguez, Di
Marco, and Langley 2009). Iron depletion (low iron stores) has been observed
among elite swimmers, especially females (Brigham et al. 1993; Gropper et al.
2006). Iron deficiency, with or without anemia, can impair muscle function and
limit exercise performance. In general, a diet that provides adequate iron intake
can be said to be providing adequate intake of all essential nutrients. Paying
careful attention to dietary iron intake is therefore almost a guarantee against
the development of nutritional deficiencies.
The recommended dietary allowance for iron for men aged 19 years and older
is 8 milligrams per day; the recommended dietary allowance for iron for women
aged 19 to 50 years is 18 milligrams per day (Thompson, Manore, and Sheeshka
2005). Elite swimmers and those who are vegetarian or regular blood donors
should aim for an iron intake greater than the recommended dietary allowance
(Rodriguez, Di Marco, and Langley 2009). The high incidence of iron depletion
among athletes is usually attributed to inadequate energy intake (Rodriguez,
Di Marco, and Langley). Other factors that can affect iron status include veg-
etarian diets that reduce iron availability; periods of rapid growth; training at

high altitudes; increased iron losses in sweat, feces, urine, and menstrual blood;
intravascular hemolysis; regular blood donation; and injury.
Consistently poor iron intake can negatively affect health and physical and
mental performance. Prompt medical intervention and ongoing monitoring is
warranted. Some athletes may experience a transient decrease in serum ferritin
and hemoglobin at the initiation of training because of hemodilution in response
to a normal training-induced increase in plasma volume, a common phenomenon
known as sports anemia. Such a state may not respond to nutritional intervention.
These changes seem to be a beneficial adaptation to aerobic training and do not
negatively affect performance (Powers and Howley 2012).
In athletes who are iron deficient, iron supplementation not only improves blood
measures and iron status but also increases exercise performance as evidenced by
increased oxygen uptake and endurance, reduced heart rate, decreased lactate con-
centrations during exercise, and reduced muscle fatigue. Ironically, many athletes,
consumed by an appetite for esoteric nutritional supplements, ignore fundamental
nutritional determinants of health and performance like iron. Success in the area
of sport nutrition often consists of doing ordinary things extraordinarily well!
Folate is required for the production of red blood cells. The recommended
dietary allowance for folate for men and women aged 19 years and older is 400
micrograms per day (Thompson, Manore, and Sheeshka 2005). Folate is fre-
quently low in the diets of female athletes, especially those who are vegetarian
or have disordered eating patterns (Rodriguez, Di Marco, and Langley 2009).
Severe deficiency of folate may result in anemia and reduced exercise perfor-
mance (Rodriguez, Di Marco, and Langley 2009). Folate supplementation is
recommended for females of reproductive age; its use is associated with a sig-
nificant reduction in the risk of certain birth defects in children born to those
with appropriate levels of this nutrient.
Antidoping Activities in Swimming
Regulations against drug use in sport began in the 1920s and gained urgency
after the amphetamine-related deaths of the Danish cyclist Knut Jensen during
the 1960 Rome Olympics and the UK competitor Tommy Simpson in the 1967
Tour de France. Doping controls in Olympic competitions were introduced at
the 1968 Mexico games. In the years that have followed, doping control activi-
ties have evolved considerably and are now the fundamental responsibility of
the WADA, created in 1999 under the auspices of governments and the inter-
national sport community as an independent international organization to
promote, coordinate, and monitor the fight against doping in sport. The WADA
Code is the basis of antidoping policies and rules among sports organizations;
the most recent version was adopted in South Africa in 2013, and it became
active in January 2015. The WADA Code defines doping as the occurrence of
one or more of the rule violations identified in the sidebar “Doping as Defined
by the World Anti-Doping Agency Code” (World Anti-Doping Agency 2009).

Doping as Defined by the World Anti-Doping Agency Code
1. Presence of a prohibited substance or its metabolites or markers in an
athlete’s sample.
2. Use or attempted use by an athlete of a prohibited substance or a pro-
hibited method.
3. Refusing or failing, without compelling justification, to submit a sample
collection after notification as authorized in applicable anti-doping rules,
or otherwise evading sample collection.
4. Violation of applicable requirements regarding athlete availability for
out-of-competition testing, including failure to file required whereabouts
information and missed tests that are declared based on rules that comply
with the International Standard for Testing. Any combination of three
missed tests or filing failures within an 18-month period as determined
by the anti-doping organization with jurisdiction over the athlete shall
constitute an anti-doping rule violation.
5. Tampering or attempted tampering with any part of doping control.
6. Possession of prohibited substances and prohibited methods.
7. Trafficking or attempted trafficking in any prohibited substance or pro-
hibited method.
8. Possession by an athlete in-competition of any prohibited method or
prohibited substance, or administration or attempted administration to
any athlete out-of-competition of any prohibited method or any prohib-
ited substance that is prohibited out-of-competition, or assisting, encour-
aging, aiding, abetting, covering up, or any other type of complicity
involving an anti-doping rule violation or any attempted anti-doping rule
violation.
Each year WADA publishes a list of substances and methods prohibited in sport
called the Prohibited List. A list of these substance and methods can be found
on the WADA website at www.wada-ama.org.
Athletes, coaches, and trainers at every level of competition need to be aware
of the prohibited substances and methods. Equally important, all competitive
swimmers need to understand their responsibility to ensure that training and
competition take place in a manner consistent with the spirit of sport and ensure
that nothing they ingest or are administered is considered a doping agent as
defined by the Prohibited List. This point is of particular significance, as previously
noted, when considering the use of nutritional supplements, which may contain
prohibited substances and represent a veritable minefield for the competitor.
In cases when injury, illness, or established medical condition requires the use
of otherwise prohibited medications, athletes and their doctors can apply for a

Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE). A panel of medical experts with particular
experience in the care and treatment of high-performance athletes carefully
reviews the medical circumstances of the competitor and the necessity for the
use of specific medication. With their approval, permission is granted for the
use of the specific medication; the detection of that substance in the process of
doping control will not be adjudged an antidoping violation when a TUE has
been previously granted.
History of Doping in Elite Swimming
Competitors from the DDR (the former East Germany) dominated women’s swim-
ming in the 1970s and 1980s. At the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, East German ath-
letes won 40 gold medals, including 11 of the 13 gold medals available in women’s
swimming events. For two decades, these women were nearly unbeatable in the
pool. Following the fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the East German
regime in 1989, the truth of the East German state’s systematic steroid program
(State Plan 14.25), which involved administering performance-enhancing drugs
to their athletes, became clear (Durham 2013). The drug program, administered
with or without the knowledge of the athletes, resulted in numerous victories
in national and international competition, and unfortunate consequences for
many of these swimmers years later. Swimmers as young as 13 years of age were
administered oral and injectable anabolic steroids. Coaches and trainers often
represented the pills and injections as vitamin preparations (Durham 2013). In
1998 Carola Nitschke, who broke the world breaststroke record at age 14, became
the first doped athlete to return her medals and ask that her name be stricken
from the record books; Nitschke reported being given as many as 30 pills a day.
The current German government now estimates that 10 percent of the
10,000 doped athletes face serious health issues. The reported problems have
included an array of hormonal side effects: excessive hair growth, deepening
of the voice, and masculinization of the genitalia as well as gynecologic issues
including infertility and breast cancer. Many of these unfortunate competitors
have reported mental health issues or delivered children with birth defects,
consequences, it is assumed, of the doping program that operated many years
earlier. More than 20 years after their Olympic success in Montreal, former East
German coaches, trainers, and officials faced criminal charges. In 2000 a Berlin
court found the former East German sports chief, Manfred Ewald, and medical
director, Manfred Hoppner, guilty of “systematic and overall doping” in East
German competitive sports.

Anabolic Steroids
Anabolic steroids appear on the WADA’s list of prohibited substances and
methods, and they have been among the most commonly abused prohibited
substances by elite swimmers (figure 15.3). It is well known that anabolic steroid
use, while increasing lean muscle mass and improving sports performance, can
lead to deleterious health outcomes. Possible adverse effects include, but are not
limited to, increased levels of aggression, liver damage, premature long-bone
growth plate closure in adolescents, menstrual irregularities, deepening of

et al. 2005; Momaya, Fawal, and Estes 2015).
Blood Doping
Blood doping—the manipulation of certain blood elements, the red blood
cells, by blood transfusion or hormonal stimulation of red blood cell produc-
tion—enhances oxygen-carrying capacity and is clearly identified as a prohibited
method. Although several well-controlled research trials have demonstrated that
blood doping can improve exercise performance and maximal aerobic capacity
.
(VOmax), there is general agreement that such practices have no place in modern
2
sport. Competition should occur between swimmers, not hematologists!
Erythropoietin (EPO), a peptide hormone now available in recombinant
forms, is naturally produced by the human body and is released from the
kidneys. It stimulates red blood cell production by the bone marrow, thereby
increasing their number and enhancing oxygen transport. The administration
of this synthetic hormone produces the effects of blood doping—an increase
in red cell numbers—without actual blood transfusion (Sawka et al. 1996). Its
use provides a new challenge to antidoping authorities, who have responded
by developing unique, sequential profiles of a competitor’s blood values, which
permit the identification of artificial manipulation. Athletes who train at altitude

experience a natural increase in red blood cell production to compensate for the
low oxygen levels (hypoxia). Training at altitude, however, usually results in a
reduction in training intensity; the advantages of training in such locales have
been greatly exaggerated.
Blood doping can have several adverse effects, including enhancing the likeli-
hood of clot formation because of the increased viscosity of the blood (Momaya,
Fawal, Estes 2015). The development of blood clots can obstruct blood flow to
the heart and brain, resulting in a heart attack or stroke. The misuse of recom-
binant human EPO may also lead to autoimmune diseases and serious health
consequences. Many deaths have been documented among athletes following
the administration of EPO (Montagnana et al. 2008; Dhar et al. 2005; Momaya,
Fawal, Estes 2015).
β -Agonists
2
More than 10 percent of elite athletes suffer from exercise-induced broncho-
spasm, a constriction of the airways that limits oxygen flow and athletic capacity
(Wolfarth, Wuestenfeld, and Kindermann 2010). The risk of asthma is known to
be higher in athletes training more than 20 hours per week (Nystad, Harris, and
Borgen 2000). Repeated in-pool exposure to chlorine and related products irri-
tates the airways and may itself promote the development of asthma (Wolfarth,
Wuestenfeld, and Kindermann 2010). (Modern water treatment systems in swim-
ming pools no longer employ chlorine or related chemicals.) Exercise-induced
bronchoconstriction describes the acute transient airway narrowing that occurs
during or after exercise. It is defined as a greater than 10 percent decrease in the
ability to force air from the lungs in one second (the forced expiratory volume,
or FEV) after an exercise challenge (Billen and Dupont 2008). The drying of the
1
airways caused by increased rates of breathing during exercise is also a trigger
for exercise-induced bronchoconstriction (Billen and Dupont 2008). Swimmers
are at risk of exercise-induced bronchoconstriction because of the high volume
of air managed by the lungs (described as a high respiratory minute volume) in
association with swimming (Billen and Dupont 2008). The modern pharma-
cological management of asthma fundamentally involves the use of inhaled
glucocorticosteroids to maintain optimal airway function and the use of bron-
chodilator therapy (e.g. β-agonists) to address or prevent any further increase
2
of asthma symptoms. For those in whom exercise has been demonstrated to
stimulate bronchospasm, the use of short acting β-agonists before exercise will
2
substantially prevent exercise-induced asthma attacks (Wolfarth, Wuestenfeld,
and Kindermann 2010; Billen and Dupont 2008).
The prevalence of exercise-induced asthma and bronchoconstriction is greater
in elite athletes than it is in the general population (Rundell and Jenkinson 2002).
Since 1984 the number of athletes using β agonists to manage these condi-
2-
tions has increased (Wolfarth, Wuestenfeld, and Kindermann 2010). The use of
β-agonists both in and out of competition is permitted when a clear diagnosis
2
of asthma can be established. Use of the most common antiasthmatic medica-

--- Page 332 Text ---

tions (salbutamol, formoterol, and salmeterol) is allowed without obtaining a
Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) if the levels of the medications do not exceed
specified thresholds when identified in urine tests. The use of other antiasthmatic
agents including terbutaline is permitted following the receipt of a TUE. When
applying for a TUE for the use of certain antiasthmatic medications, evidence of
the diagnosis of asthma in the form of the results of specific lung-function tests,
a clear clinical history, and the documentation of the diagnosis by a physician
must be submitted to a national antidoping organization or, in the case of an
elite competitor, to FINA. There has been concern that inhaled β-agonists might
2
have a performance-enhancing effect, but the evidence to support this concept
is limited. A review of the literature performed in 2010 revealed that most ran-
domized placebo-controlled trials in nonasthmatic elite athletes demonstrated
no performance-enhancing effects of inhaled β-agonists (formoterol, salbuta-
2
mol, salmeterol, and terbutaline), but lung function (FEV) was improved after
1
inhalation of β-agonists in most of these studies (Wolfarth, Wuestenfeld, and
2
Kindermann 2010; Kindermann 2007). The use of inhaled glucocorticosteroids
is permitted; no ergogenic effect of these steroid preparations administered in
this manner has been demonstrated to date (Billen and Dupont 2008). Note that
one β-agonist, clenbuterol, is used in certain regions (e.g., South and Central
2
America and China) to enhance muscle growth in farm animals. The ingestion
of meat products by athletes in these countries has frequently resulted in the
identification of clenbuterol in subsequent urine samples. This situation is of
obvious concern to competitors and antidoping officials. Clenbuterol is not
seen as a highly effective antiasthmatic agent, and it is used as such in only a
few countries.
Remote Ischemic Preconditioning
Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) is a method in which brief episodes of
alternating ischemia (restriction of blood flow) and reperfusion (restoration of
blood flow) induced in distant tissues or organs produces chemicals that protect
muscles from the effects of ischemia (restriction of blood flow leading to reduced
oxygen levels needed for cellular metabolism) that may occur in subsequent
exercise (Przyklenk and Whittaker 2011). RIPC can be induced by cycles of infla-
tion and deflation of a standard blood pressure cuff on a limb. Some literature
suggests that RIPC may be used to enhance swimming performance through
improvements in muscle tolerance to tissue hypoxia (Jean-St-Michel et al. 2011).
In support, several investigators reported that RIPC of the legs has been shown
to improve maximal performance by 1.6 percent and maximal oxygen consump-
tion by 3 percent in healthy participants performing bicycle testing (de Groot
et al. 2010). In highly trained swimmers, a recent report revealed that RIPC was
associated with improved maximal performance (100-meter swims) (Jean-St-
Michel et al. 2011). Although RIPC is possibly a promising method to enhance
performance, the studies to date that have examined its effect on swimming

}
322 Reed and Pipe
performance have been limited to a small number of trained athletes in a few
events. Future studies with athletes of varying performance levels from a range of
sports are needed to gain a full evaluation of the effect of RIPC on performance.
Coaching Education
Coaches are critical to the creation of an environment in which scientific
approaches to training and nutrition are the norm. Their attitudes toward doping
practices are central to ensuring the development of appropriate sporting values
among swimmers. Many coaches declare that self-education is their main source
of information regarding nutritional supplementation and antidoping matters.
None seem to be of the opinion that doping does not exist in elite swimming.
Coaches also seem to know more about sport nutrition and doping than ath-
letes do, and coaches express more support for stronger penalties following the
detection of doping behavior than athletes do (Sajber et al. 2013).
In response to coaches’ learning needs and demanding schedules, the WADA
has taken a lead in launching CoachTrue, a computer-based, self-teaching anti-
doping tool, that can be found at www.wada-ama.org.
CoachTrue’s elite-level module includes the following:
1. Pretest, an evaluation of a coach’s current knowledge
2. Tutorials, a series of presentations that provide essential information on the
health consequences of doping, the coach’s accountability, results manage-
ment, Therapeutic Use Exemptions, whereabouts, and decision making
3. Scenario-based activities, a practical application of acquired knowledge to
likely real-life scenarios
4. Who wants to play true?, a fun way for coaches to test their knowledge on
antidoping issues
5. Posttest and certification, a final assessment after coaches have completed
all required learning steps, and a certificate of participation
This important resource is recommended for all coaches who want to enhance
their understanding of how they can provide powerful leadership to their swim-
mers while creating a training environment in which doping practices are clearly
and explicitly condemned.
New Strategic Approaches
Two new approaches to assist in the fight against doping that have emerged in
the past few years are the athlete biological passport (ABP) and gene doping.
Biological Passport
The athlete biological passport (ABP) is an electronic record of test results based
on the monitoring of selected parameters over time that indirectly reveals the

--- Page 334 Text ---
|
Performance Enhancers and Doping Control 323
effects of doping, as opposed to the traditional direct detection of doping by
analytical means (Gilbert 2010; Sottas et al. 2011). The WADA executive com-
mittee first approved the WADA Athlete Biological Passport Operating Guide-
lines on December 1, 2009. A note from the WADA provides background on the
biological passport:
The fight against doping relies on several strategies, including the direct
testing of athletes as well as evidence gathered in the context of non-
analytical doping violations. By combining these strategies, and seeking
new ones to address emerging threats, the global fight against doping is
more effective. The typical doping control approach based on the detection
of prohibited substance or their metabolites in an athlete’s sample remains
an effective approach; however it has limitations when an athlete may be
using substances on an intermittent and/or low-dose basis. Furthermore,
new substances or modifications of prohibited substances (e.g., designer
drugs) may be difficult to detect by conventional analytical means. In
recent years, doping regimes have become much more scientifically planned
and have taken advantage of the weaknesses in traditional protocols. This
underscores the need for a more sophisticated and complementary strategy
to effectively fight doping, namely, the Athlete Biological Passport. (World
Anti-Doping Agency 2013)
In 2012 FINA introduced a pilot ABP now involving 32 of the world’s top-
ranked swimmers, in several events, drawn from around the globe. Frequent
blood testing of such competitors is ongoing, and hematological profiles have
been developed. Additional blood tests involving these and other swimmers
were performed immediately before the 2012 London Olympic Games; hundreds
more blood samples were obtained at the time of the 2013 Barcelona FINA World
Championships. The development of ABP profiles of FINA swimmers has begun.
Sequential monitoring of the results of these samples permits the construction
of an individual athlete’s blood profile (figure 15.4). Careful examination of the
profile permits the identification of any anomalous results and triggers additional
reviews by hematological experts. The use of such approaches allows experts
to conclude that manipulation of blood products has occurred. This technique
permits the prosecution of cases without actual evidence of the presence of a
prohibited substance in the blood or urine. Expansion of the FINA ABP program
is expected to continue.
Gene Doping
Gene doping is defined by the WADA as the nontherapeutic use of cells, genes,
genetic elements, or the modulation of gene expression, having the capacity
to improve athletic performance (World Anti-Doping Agency 2014). Genes are
composed of segments of DNA that provide a code for the production of vari-
ous proteins. These proteins build our cells and instruct them how to function.

The most common way to insert a gene into the body is to use a disabled virus
that has been altered so that it is not itself harmful but can act as a vehicle for
the delivery of DNA to a cell. An example of gene doping might include the use
of gene therapies to increase muscle growth or blood-cell production, enhance
oxygen-carrying capacity, or augment pain resistance. Notwithstanding the
considerable expansion of our knowledge of genetics, it is doubtful that gene
doping is currently a reality, although the WADA and its partners have already
made it a research priority. In 2003 the prohibited list of substances and methods
was amended to include gene doping, which has remained on the Prohibited
List ever since. The WADA has collaborated with genetic scientists worldwide
to initiate discussions and research projects that examine approaches to the
detection of gene doping. Further, the WADA has undertaken education efforts
to inform athletes that gene doping will be an imperfect science and dangerous
(World Anti-Doping Agency 2014). The WADA’s views on gene doping have been
succinctly stated:

coordinating and monitoring the global fight against doping in sport in
all its forms, WADA is devoting significant resources and attention to
ways that will enable the detection of gene doping. (World Anti-Doping
Agency 2014)
Summary
The continually growing popularity of swimming around the world is a testament
to the appeal of this sport, its ability to ensure fitness, and the excitement that
surrounds aquatic competition. The desire to enhance swimming performance
and achieve competitive success is natural and commendable. All those involved
in the care and coaching of swimmers must ensure that their preparation and
training reflect sound scientific principles and take place in accordance with
evidence-based best practice in an atmosphere that reflects an unwavering com-
mitment to fair competition and doping-free sport.

CHAPTER
Swimming Psychology:
Merging Mind and Body
—James Bauman, PhD
The subtitle of this chapter, “Merging Mind and Body,” is meant to challenge
the reader to adopt new ways of thinking about the mental side of swimming.
The title seems to imply that the mind and body are disconnected or experi-
ence a changing degree of connectedness. It also implies that to swim faster, a
swimmer’s body and mind must be synchronized in the pool and must be able
to disregard the disconnecting distracters associated with competing and per-
forming on demand. Both statements are true. For swimmers to achieve their
potential in the pool, the mind and body must work as one. Clearly, anatomical
and physiological elements link the body to the mind or brain; we see these
in the form of skeletal, muscular, organ, circulatory, neurological, and chemi-
cal connections. Although these physical connections exist, anyone who has
competed knows that on some training and competitive days, there seems to
be a complete disconnect—an absence of a connection between what the mind
wants the body to do and how the body actually performs.
The matrix of connections linking the mind to the body continues to be
unraveled and understood. Only recently have neuroscientists and practitioners
discovered some ways in which these complex connections work, and they freely
admit that there is much they do not yet understand. Ongoing research provides
some answers into how the mind and body work together, but even those answers
seem to create more questions. The space required to address the current body
of knowledge on this topic would fill a textbook, and many questions would
still be left unanswered. But we cannot wait for all the answers to be discovered.
We need to convey to young athletes what the applied research and experience
is currently telling us. That is the purpose of this chapter.
We have all listened to an athlete or coach being interviewed after a less-
than-successful athletic performance. Athletes, in these instances, frequently say
327

328 Bauman
something like, “I wasn’t mentally tough” or “I lost my focus,” whereas coaches
may say, “We made too many mental mistakes” or “We didn’t come mentally
prepared to compete.” These kinds of responses lead us to believe that the mental
part of competing is an important aspect of performance. On returning to train-
ing, however, little if anything is typically done to address the mental side of
sport for either training or competition. Instead, the swimmers are usually back
to the pool for more laps, more conditioning, more technical instruction, and
other fixes that may or may not have anything to do with a poor performance.
Merging the body and mind seems to get a lot of lip service in sport, but when
push comes to shove, the idea does not typically find its way into the regular
training regimen.
This chapter on sport psychology will be somewhat different from chapters
in other books or the information on the growing number of websites selling
repackaged concepts or never-before-disclosed magic steps to success. What
follows is based on more than 24 years of practical experience and full-time
applied work with developmental, collegiate, professional, and Olympic ath-
letes across more than 60 sports, including swimming. The mental strategies
described in this chapter are based on science, research, and applied practice.
The emphasis is on the practical application of these strategies with athletes and
teams. Coaches, athletes, and parents are provided user-friendly descriptions
of the benefits of the body and mind connection, descriptions of the kinds
of circumstances that contribute to the unraveling of those connections, and
some proven strategies that can be taken to the pool to enhance performance.
These understandable and easy-to-use strategies will help swimmers maintain
and improve the connections between mind and body, which will ultimately
result in consistently faster swimming in competition. The tone of this chapter
is conversational. Interestingly, the concepts and constructs described in this
chapter have been documented in the works of ancient philosophers, modern-
day theorists, and other smart people long before they were published in today’s
performance books or the electronic media. As such, like much of what seems to
be published, the information contained herein is probably not original; rather,
it is a consolidation of the work of those great thinkers. The new ideas that many
authors claim to offer may simply be restatements of what was said long ago,
but in a new context—sport. The content of this chapter is primarily based on
those old concepts and years of experience in applying practical approaches to
sport in real situations.
Swimming faster can look different depending on the age group of swimmers
being discussed. For example, we typically see large performance improvements
in the beginning of an athlete’s career. These advances gradually become smaller
as the athletes approach their ultimate performance potential (talent). Although
these later improvements are incrementally smaller, they are proportionately as
significant as what occurred in the earlier stages. With only a slight variation
in the language and attention given to age, developmental, and experience dif-
ferences, the strategies to swim faster found in this chapter can be applied to
swimmers of all ages.

Analogies are used throughout this chapter to illustrate points and concepts.
An analogy shows similarities between concepts that might ordinarily seem
unrelated. Analogies help provide insight into what could be a confusing or ill-
defined subject or situation by using a subject or object that is more familiar or
more easily understood. Analogies are an effective way to teach lessons about
a variety of challenging subjects. Analogous tools will assist in describing the
strategies to help swimmers stay on track and progressively swim faster. The tools
and strategies to be discussed in this chapter include the following:
• Developing mental pliability (or plyability; see sidebar)
• Establishing a competition plan that has a high probability of success (beat
personal average)
• Competing in the present (gravity)
• Paying attention to self-talk
• Identifying and managing pressure or distraction (hot water tanks)
• Managing physiological and psychological energy (tachometers)
• Going through yellow lights (fuel warning lights and traffic lights)
• Using the pit crew
The chapter is broken into sections to address each of these facets of mental
preparation and performance.
Finally, although this chapter is about swimming fast, all of what is written
can pertain to life in and out of the pool, as well as other sports. Sport psychol-
ogy is about improving all facets of human performance, not only sport.
Mental Toughness or Mental Pliability?
To begin this section, let’s first challenge some of the terminology that has been
used in the field of sport psychology and offer a different perspective on the
much-overused concept of mental toughness. Setting the stage for that chal-
lenge and using our first analogy, we can use basic computer terminology to
describe the body (below the chin) as hardware and the mind (above the chin)
as software. Although other chapters in this book look at the hardware involved
in swimming in detail, this chapter focuses on the software.
Nearly every sport psychology book either addresses or refers to the concept of
mental toughness and explains its necessity to elite sport performance. But is it
mental toughness or some other attribute that is truly important for a swimmer?
Being tough has long been a mainstay in the good-old-boy way of thinking about
the mental side of sport performance. But mental toughness does not clearly
describe that evasive characteristic commonly associated with elite athletes who
consistently perform at higher levels. Vince Lombardi, the legendary coach of the
Green Bay Packers, once said, “The difference between a successful person and
others is not a lack of strength or lack of knowledge, but rather a lack of will.”
The “will” that Coach Lombardi was referring to may have been what others

--- Page 341 Text ---
}
330 Bauman
over the years have called mental toughness. Unfortunately, we will never know
exactly what Lombardi was thinking when he fashioned that famous quotation.
But I believe that within the field of sport psychology and possibly in the spirit
of Coach Lombardi, we are overdue in developing more descriptive terms that
clearly articulate the characteristics we see in athletes who just don’t quit. We
need a clearer mental picture of “will.” Instead of mental toughness, I propose
the term mental pliability to describe that special, necessary, and core ingredient
seen in most elite performers—those who can perform on demand, under all
circumstances, and with consistent high-end results. I see a difference between
mental toughness and mental pliability. It’s more than just semantics; the dif-
ference between the two concepts is the flexibility, adaptability, and “stick-to-
it-ness” that mental pliability suggests.
Imagine a solid piece of wood with the same dimensions as a thick telephone
book. Let’s equate those objects to the concepts of mental toughness (wood)
and mental pliability (telephone book). Being mentally tough generates images
of someone who is thick-skinned, solid, hard, unshakeable, and seemingly
unbreakable, like that solid piece of wood. Yet if one were to take that piece of
wood and throw it against something harder, hit it on a sharp edge, or hit it with
a hammer, the wood likely would crack, splinter, or break apart. Although, on
the outside, the piece of wood appears rigid, solid, and strong, under the right
conditions it is not so tough and not so unbreakable.
Mental Plyability
Another way to describe the psychological flexibility required to succeed in
swimming is as mental plyability, bringing to mind the flexible strength of
plywood as opposed to the rigid but breakable structure of a hardwood.
Now consider a phone book and envision how it would perform if thrown
against something hard, hit against a sharp edge, or struck with a hammer. It
wouldn’t crack, splinter, or break apart like the wood. Instead, it would bend and
temporarily change shape to absorb the shock and then return to its original
shape. The phone book is malleable; it can change its shape, absorb or deflect
force, handle repeated physical contact, and retain its original shape. In short,
it demonstrates adaptability and resilience. The only way to break a phone book
would be to methodically tear it apart a few pages at a time. Great athletes, like
a phone book, can bend or adapt to many situations; they are resilient and do
not break under pressure or contact. The ability to adapt to the situation and
environment results in the development of resilient durability over time. More
than mental toughness, this ingredient is necessary in competitive athletes. This
is what I think Coach Lombardi was describing.
So should a swimmer be mentally tough or mentally pliable? Athletes who
choose to be pliable will find strategies in this chapter to equip them to move in
that direction. Athletes who want to be tough must be prepared to face the con-

sequences of potentially breaking into pieces under those special circumstances
that will challenge toughness and try to break them apart—competition! Mental
pliability (or plyability), not mental toughness, will connect swimmers’ software
with their hardware in ways that get them to the wall faster than ever before.
Competing in the Present:
Gravity and Autopilot
As previously mentioned, precisely defining the mind and body connection is
difficult because science has not yet completed the entire puzzle. We still don’t
know exactly how all the pieces fit together. But the observable effects of the
mind and body being connected or disconnected are easier to quantify or at least
describe. Similarly, the next analogy used to illustrate the importance of that
connection is gravity, which, by the way, is another difficult-to-define phenom-
enon. Gravity! How can the power of connecting the mind with the body have
anything to do with gravity? Well, that is the spirit of the analogy. Although the
similarity may not be apparent, that connection will soon become clear.
What is gravity? Newton (1729) said, “Every point mass attracts every single
other point mass by a force pointing along the line intersecting both points.”
He described that effect as gravity. Newton’s law of universal gravitation further
stated, “Every massive particle in the universe attracts every other massive par-
ticle with a force, which is directly proportional to the product of their masses
and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.” Now,
doesn’t that clear up the importance and power of connecting the mind and
body in sport?
Actually, what Newton was describing is the incredible power of attraction
between two objects in space, an attraction that exists even when those objects
are in constant motion. To expand on this analogy, let’s look at the power of
gravity between the sun and the known planets in the solar system. Without
the gravitational pull between the sun and the planets, all the planets would
simply fly off into the universe. The powerful gravitational attraction between
these massive objects keeps the planets invisibly connected to the sun, even as
they orbit around it.
If we move to a smaller gravitational relationship and look at the forces that
exist between the earth and the moon, we see similar effects. Just as we saw with
the sun and the planets, the gravitational pull between the earth and moon
prevents the moon from flying out into the universe. As a result, the moon
remains in continuous orbit around the earth. What is also interesting is that
the relationship between the earth and the moon affects not only what happens
to the moon but also what occurs here on earth. For example, the gravitational
pull of the moon on the earth creates ocean tides. We also know that the sun has
an effect on the tides, but not nearly to the extent that the moon does. Research
has found that the strongest gravitational pull occurs along an imaginary line
drawn from the center of the moon to the center of the earth. Water is pulled

--- Page 343 Text ---
}
332 Bauman
toward this line, causing the tides. This line where the strongest gravitational
pull occurs is continuously moving, following the moon throughout its entire
orbit. Consequently, the tides ebb and flow, following the moon as it orbits the
earth. Gravity is an amazingly powerful phenomenon!
Now let’s consider an even smaller planetary relationship and look at the
metaphorical and potential gravitational pull or attraction between the mind
and the body. What if there were a similar and equally powerful connection
between mind and body? What if there is a possibility that when we line them
up, like the earth and moon, there is also an incredible gravitational effect?
When the mind and the body are synchronized, athletes describe the strength
and ease of performance that occurs. Just maybe, they are experiencing the
metaphorical force of gravity.
Athletes frequently describe the experience of being in the zone, another
commonly used description, when they perform amazingly well. At times, the
mind and the body are in the same place, the same time zone, if you will. It is
almost as if the athlete experiences, from a human perspective, the same invis-
ible gravitational power that the earth and moon experience in every moment
of every day. Elite athletes who understand that connection and that experience
also understand how to increase the likelihood of experiencing it with increas-
ing frequency. So, how do they do that?
Sport psychologists have consistently encouraged athletes to be in the moment.
That encouragement is meant to persuade athletes to maintain a conscious, but
subtle, mental focus and involvement in the experience of what is happening
right now. Although the suggestion to focus on the present is easy to articulate,
in practice, athletes often find it difficult to understand conceptually what being
in the moment actually means, why it is important, and how to achieve it in
competition on a consistent basis.
In working to help athletes understand how to get in the zone, let’s first con-
sider the three most generic time zones in life, as well as in and out of sport: the
past, present, and future (figure 16.1).
Past Present Future
Mind
Body

Swimming Psychology: Merging Mind and Body 333
Figure 16.1 illustrates that the body can be only in the present (lower dark
square). I can think of only two situations in which the physical body can be in
any time zone but the present: when in a time machine (we’re still working on
this apparatus) or while flying on a jet across time zones or datelines. Therefore,
we can safely say that the body is always in the present. But the mind (thoughts
and emotions) is free to wander and dwell on the past (upper-left light gray
square), the present (upper-middle dark gray square), and the future (upper-
right light gray square). Because the body can be only in the present time zone,
for a swimmer to perform in the zone and achieve the necessary body–mind
alignment, the mind must also be in the present. The two dark gray squares
connected by the dark lines represent this body and mind connection, in the
present moment. Right here, right now, and in this moment is where a swimmer
wants to be when competing. When this happens, the swimmer is good to go and
good to go fast! Maybe that is the gravitational connection experienced when
a swimmer swims well and swims fast. Thinking about the past or the future
takes the mind out of alignment with the body, so performance decreases. In
these cases, the swimmer is not good to go, or at least not to go fast! We seem
to be fighting thinking and emotional gravity in that case.
Unlike the body, the mind can easily move across all the time zones. In fact,
that movement of thought and emotions can travel across those time zones regu-
larly leading up to, during, and even after a competition. For example, it is not
unusual for athletes to begin to question whether they prepared well enough or
long enough (past); to ask themselves what they will do if they have a bad start, a
bad turn, or run out of energy (future); to think that other swimmers look more
fit and therefore will swim faster (future); to think that other swimmers have
better times and therefore will swim faster (future); or to think they don’t belong
here (present). All these thoughts, including the one specific negative example
in the present, are chances for an athlete’s mind and body to disconnect. Any
thoughts about what should or could have been (past) or concern about what
should or could happen (future) will result in a temporal misalignment of body
and mind and a decrease in the synergistic power (gravity) that occurs when the
body and the mind are in the present. But when thoughts are focused on the job
in this moment (present), the likelihood that the swimmer will encounter an
in-the-moment experience increases. All that distracting thinking begins to fade
away, and all thoughts turn inward and toward the task at hand—technique,
tactics, it’s time to go, and it’s time to swim fast!
Outstanding swimmers regularly report that swimming in the present is a
powerful experience that feels effortless, quiet, fluid, and rhythmic. We associate
these descriptions with swimming in the zone. If, while preparing for or swim-
ming an event, an athlete focuses on a mistake made in a past race or dwells on
the expectations of needing to swim a personal best to make a team (future),
performance will likely not be its best. But a swimmer who is able to prepare
and swim moment by moment, stroke by stroke according to an established
race plan will likely have better swims. An athlete who swims in the moment

will progressively focus on getting an explosive start while on the blocks, then
generating powerful and efficient underwater kicks, then settling in to establish
a rhythmic breathing pattern and powerful stroke rate, then preparing for and
completing a quick and powerful turn off the wall, performing the underwater
kick again, recapturing the rhythm of breathing and stroke rate, and finally taking
a last breath with a long and powerful reach and touch to the finish. When a
race is swum progressively (biomechanically and mentally), the swimmer will
have stayed in the moment while progressing through the event. Being mindful
of the present allows athletes to take advantage of synchronizing their thoughts
with their motor movements in the pool. Remember how the gravitational rela-
tionship between the moon and the earth is constantly changing as the moon
slowly orbits the earth? Similarly, a swimmer’s mental focus must also change
throughout a swim to draw on the power that comes from having the body and
mind perfectly aligned in the present as the swimmer moves through the race.
The moon can’t look back to where it was or could have been, or forward to
where it is going or where it might go; neither should the swimmer.
Let’s consider another analogy and think about how jumbo jets fly and trans-
port people all over the world, moving us through time. Although air travel
may seem like a complicated task, much of what goes on in the air happens
under the guidance of the plane’s autopilot. The onboard computer (autopilot)
has been programmed to increase the speed so that the plane takes off, climbs
to the right altitude, maintains the correct altitude, goes in the right direction,
decreases the altitude for landing, and then slows down for landing. Although
highly qualified pilots are necessary to manage the takeoff, monitor the flight,
and manage the landing, the onboard computer essentially flies the plane.
The same applies in the pool. Every swimmer has an on-board computer (the
brain) that is programmed through hours and hours of training. When it comes
time to race, the best swimmers have an already-developed race plan that has
been programmed into their brains. As they approach the start and step on the
blocks, they activate their autopilot and then just go. Like airline pilots, they are
the onboard pool pilots who monitor the autopilot (their competitive routine)
and sometimes make fine adjustments to the race plan (flight plan) to stay on
course and finish the race (flight). Swimmers and pilots alike get into trouble
when they start to question their flight instruments and then interfere with the
onboard computer. By progressively staying in the moment as a race unfolds,
swimmers become like airline pilots. They trust their training, their preparation,
and their machine; what is left is only monitoring and making adjustments, but
the computer (the brain) is really flying the body.
The ease at which a swimmer can swim depends on the swimmer’s ability to
trust the computer to carry out the flight plan. A swimmer who starts messing
with the controls (thinking out of the moment and into the past or future) will
likely experience a loss of power. When the mind slips to the past or future,
even for just a few seconds, technical proficiency can deteriorate. A cascading
effect then occurs; the swimmer begins to lose technical proficiency in the

--- Page 346 Text ---

water, becomes less streamlined, creates more drag, and has to work harder to
maintain a given speed.
Coaches can introduce the idea of gravity and autopilot as a way of describing
the potential power of staying in the moment. Using a concept from physical
science (gravity) can help swimmers understand the importance of focusing
on the present when competing. Going on autopilot for competition will free
up an athlete to focus on technique and race tactics rather than the distracting
past and future thoughts (self-talk) that routinely contribute to less-successful
swims. There will be more on self-talk later in the chapter. For now, the goal
should be to help swimmers focus on here and now. Talking to athletes about
this concept should be easy, but many will forget the teachings when it comes
time to compete. The use of cues or visual reminders can help remind swimmers
to stay in the present. Cue words can be written on note cards, wristbands, or
the backs of the hands or tops of the feet. For cues to be useful, they must be in
the swimmer’s visual field when the swimmer needs to remember and imple-
ment the time zone (gravity) and autopilot strategies. Here is a list of cue words:
Cue Words
F: fun (early on), fluid, free, fast, flow, fuel (use pressure to fuel you), finish
A: average (beat it!), aspirations, always pliable, autopilot, adaptable
S: self-talk (constructive), simple, solution-oriented, speed, sleek
T: time zones (be in the present), technique, tactics, tachometer
E: effortless, efficient, enjoyable, easy
R: resilient, run the yellow lights
–
Goals: Beat Your Average (>X)
Now that three basic premises have been established about the importance of
merging the mind and body (pliability, gravity, and autopilot), we are ready to
establish some direction or a plan for the competitive season. Scientists and psy-
chologists began studying goals and aspirations in the United States in the 1940s
(Lewin, et al. 1944). Atkinson (1958) began to associate the difficulty of a goal with
the probability of achieving that goal. His studies concluded that, within limits,
the more difficult the goal is, the higher the probability is of achieving that goal.
Later, Edwin Locke (1967) began more than 40 years of research in developing his
theory of goal setting and task motivation (Locke and Latham 2002). T.A. Ryan
(1970) explored the notion that motivation was the cause of human action. If a
person was motivated, things got done. If motivation was lacking, things didn’t
get done. Still later, George Duran (1981) seems to have been the first to docu-
ment the popular mnemonic SMART (specific, measureable, attainable, relevant,
and time bound), which described what he considered the key components to
establishing and achieving goals. Since that time, many people have researched,
written, and talked about their versions of the pioneering work in goal setting.

Goals seem to affect performance through at least four processes:
1. Goals provide a direction for attention, effort, and activities that are relevant
to achieving the goal.
2. Goals provide an incentive or inspirational force that moves us to action.
The higher the goal is, the greater the effort required is to accomplish the
goal. Lower goals will see less effort associated with pursuit of those goals.
3. Having goals affects persistence, particularly when people encounter the
obstacles that typically block their way in the pursuit of goals.
4. Goals directly and indirectly affect arousal levels, personal discovery, and
using task-relevant knowledge and strategies in efforts to achieve (Locke
and Latham 2002).
Earlier in the chapter, the term mental pliability was used to replace
mental toughness. Similarly, we can use the term developing a game plan as a
more effective description of what most have come to understand as goal set-
ting. Just as a company develops a business plan to guide its efforts to become
successful and profitable, the athlete needs to have a game plan for the competi-
tive year and know how to execute it to be successful and profitable in the pool.
Profitability for a swimmer is constant progress. If progress is maintained over
time, the more regularly the socially defined metric of success (winning) will
begin to happen. But if the goal or focus is only on winning, swimming faster
will likely occur only occasionally. Game plans can include athletic, academic,
career, interpersonal, social, and personal aspirations. Often, game plans include
times for each event that an athlete plans to achieve each year. Other parts of
the game plan could be qualitative in nature, and improvement might be based
on feel rather than numbers.
In working with athletes, including swimmers, for more than 24 years, I have
heard many interesting perspectives concerning game plans. With only a few
exceptions, swimmers have been indoctrinated, beginning at an early age, with
the idea that goals are important to provide some sense of forward progress and
are necessary to achieve success as a swimmer. But the practices that many ath-
letes put in place to establish and pursue goals are less than optimal. Seasonal
goal-planning sessions between coaches and athletes are often inconsistent and
sometimes unrealistic. Goals are often reviewed by athletes and coaches only at
the start and end of the competitive season. Athletes typically set yearly goals
that read something like “Set a new personal best for each event.” No real dia-
logue or specific planning occurs about how they will achieve those goals. If a
personal best is achieved during the season, the trend is usually just to change
the goal to reflect a new best time.
Experience and research have shown us that goals are probably necessary in
sport, but how they are woven into the training and competitive season is often
fragmented and inconsistent. As long as athletes chant the mantra, “My goal
is to set a personal best,” most seem to be content with that level of perceived
motivation. Practical experience and probability, however, do not favor that

--- Page 348 Text ---
|

approach toward developing a swimming game plan. Although swim times are
important and are an objective measure of overall progress, they can also become
a source of anxiety and create unnecessary pressure to perform. So, instead of
swimming faster, many athletes end up swimming slower because of the added
pressure of the expectations built up around the goal of beating a personal best.
In major competitions, athletes have consistently expressed that they believe
they must have an exceptional performance that day or do something special to
be successful. In their words, success is synonymous with winning. As soon as
athletes begin to focus on the results—winning—they take themselves out of
the game. By focusing on the outcome, not the process of getting there, swim-
mers may lose the ability to swim in the moment. They sabotage the autopilot
plan that they put in place.
Encourage swimmers to have a game plan that allows the objective measure-
ment of progress, includes aspects that have a high probability of being success-
fully completed, and can be implemented without adding the psychological
pressure that often accompanies beating a personal best. With all these things
in place, athletes will progressively swim faster. An approach to accomplishing
this came out of a set of disappointing performances for some USA athletes in
the 2000 Sydney Games.
Following those Olympic Games, interviews were conducted with several
athletes from a variety of sports whose performance could be objectively
measured (stopwatch, horizontal or vertical distance) and who were supposed
to do well at the Games but didn’t. The questions asked were formulated to
gain a better understanding of why they had performed at a level lower than
what they knew they could do and had previously proved they could do. We
wanted to know what had happened and why. Almost without exception, the
major reason the athletes gave for performing at a level below their realistically
expected performance was pressure. Pressure came in many forms, but it seemed
to cluster around real and perceived expectations of family or friends, sport
organizations, sponsors, coaches, teammates, the media, and themselves, and
an overwhelming belief that they would need to have the best performance
of their lives. Here they were at the biggest sporting event, and the athletes
described a nearly complete abandonment of everything they had done to get
themselves to this place. Suddenly, the Games had changed their game plan
and wrapped it in a shroud of anxiousness that took them out of their usual
performance preparation and routine. What was also interesting was that every
athlete interviewed was clearly concerned about the time, height, or distance
they believed they needed to achieve to be successful, to win a medal. Among
those disappointed by their performance as measured with a stopwatch or
measuring stick were athletes who became too focused on those results, athletes
who forgot the game plan, athletes who unconsciously abandoned the game
plan, and athletes who couldn’t execute the game plan. These athletes all said
that if they had been able to reduce the anxiety that they experienced in the
hours, minutes, and seconds right before the event, they would have and could
have performed differently.

Anxiety is really a symptom of a wide range of other issues. To decrease anxi-
ety, we first have to identify the source of that anxiety. If we attempt to decrease
the symptoms of anxiety without addressing the reasons for that experience, we
will not be successful. Simply put, as in the field of medicine, if we treat only
the symptoms of a problem rather than the problem itself, the symptoms will
continue to be present.
Athletes experience anxiety for many reasons, but one in particular seemed
to be common among all athletes who saw anxiety adversely affect their per-
formances. What came from the interviews with the Olympic athletes was some
compelling information regarding their beliefs about themselves when they
competed. They believed that they had to do something special. For them, that
meant performing at a level that would result in a personal best or beyond.
When attempting to understand more about what these athletes were saying,
we learned that there was a real sense of doubt that they could achieve the expec-
tations, or goals, that they had placed on themselves. The chances of setting a
personal best in the company of other great athletes seemed suddenly small to
them. Clearly, these athletes were focusing on a goal with a low probability of
success, and they knew it! In fact, many of these athletes indicated that for them
to be successful in a field of other extremely talented athletes, they would need
to surpass their previous personal best by far. At that point, they entered a zone,
but it was more like a twilight zone, not a performance zone.
Part of changing an athlete’s perspective about performance is to look at
statistics and performance trends. One strategy to reduce anxiety is to teach
athletes about performance probability and incorporate that concept into their
game plans (goals), their training, and competition. Let’s talk briefly about
probability. One of the more common ways to illustrate the chances that some-
thing will occur (probability) is by using a frequency distribution. A frequency
distribution illustrates the frequency at which various scores occur over time. A
normal distribution, or the bell-shaped curve (figure 16.2), named after its rela-
tive bell-shaped appearance, is used to illustrate any variable (e.g., an athlete’s
swim times for a given event) with how many times each race time has occurred
(frequency) over a particular period.
As we look at frequency distributions, probability tables, and statistical for-
mulas to calculate the chances that particular scores (swim times) will occur
(standard deviations), we find that performance scores tend to cluster around
the average time for any particular event. That statement simply means that it is
easy to calculate the probability of what an athlete might swim on any given day.
Just know the swimmer’s average time for that event. The average of a swimmer’s
times in an event is calculated just like a scholastic grade point average. Simply
add up all of a swimmer’s times in an event and then divide by the number of
times that event was swum. That result is an average time for the event. The
–
symbol X (X-bar) is used to represent the average swim time.
To understand swim time probabilities as percentages shown in figure 16.2,
we can break swims down into five categories:

Swimming Psychology: Merging Mind and Body 339
Average
Swim times (400 IM)
1. Good swims, those times clustered around and on either side of the average
time, occur about 68 percent of the time.
2. On the slower side of the swim average, mediocre swim times (well below
the average time, but not the worst) occur about 14 percent of the time.
3. Suck swims, to use a swimmer’s vernacular (the slowest ever times), occur
about 2 percent of the time.
4. On the faster side of the swim average, really good swims (faster than the
average swim time for an event but still short of a personal best) occur
approximately 14 percent of the time. Note that these swims occur about
as often as the mediocre swims on the slower side of the curve.
5. Finally, the category of great swims (equal to or greater than a personal best)
occurs about 2 percent of the time. These swims occur with about the same
probability as the worst swims.
All this is meant to illustrate that if swimmers have the goal of setting a personal
best each time they swim, they have only about a 2 percent chance of doing that!
No wonder athletes go to the start with doubt, anxiety, pressure, and fear of what
is likely to happen. You aren’t doing the statistical analysis, but you have a feel for
your chances of having a spectacular swim. That is what can get into your head!
What statistics do not take into account are other potential negative human
factors (e.g., what the swimmer is thinking and feeling, illness, injury, what’s at
stake, and so on) or potential positive human factors (e.g., having and following
a game plan, pliability, swimming in the moment, having successfully done this
before, having a genuine feeling of being ready, and so on). These factors are left

out of probability tables, but they clearly affect times and performances. Instead,
probabilities are based on the cold hard facts of scores (swim times). But think
about it. If a swimmer could reduce any sense of anxiety that is experienced
before a swimming event, doesn’t it make sense to generate a completely dif-
ferent set of scores? That’s exactly what the 2000 Sydney athletes were looking
for in those Games, but unfortunately they didn’t find it when they needed it.
Again, by reflecting on the average swim rather than a personal best swim,
the probability of beating the average time is nearly 70 percent. Swimmers can
go into a swimming event knowing that the game plan of beating their average
has more than a 70 percent chance of being successful. That probability of suc-
cess is certainly much higher than the 2 percent probability of setting a personal
best! Experiencing consistent success is important, and this strategy of beating
the average sets the stage for that to happen on a regular basis.
–
When the concept of beating their average (greater than X) is first introduced
to athletes, they are often skeptical and think that the approach is too easy. They
become skeptical because they have not been conditioned to think that way and
they have not approached developing a game plan that way. After all, beating
their own average is no big deal, or so they thought. But consider this. As with
an academic grade point average, the higher the average is raised, the more chal-
lenging it becomes trying to beat it. In the case of a swimmer, the average time is
getting faster, or lower. Imagine training and competing all year with the plan of
beating your average time each time you swim. By the end of the year, you will
have decreased your times and established a new performance mantra—beat my
average. Instead of an anxiety-filled statement such as “I need to do something
special and set a personal record,” the swimmer becomes conditioned to put less
emphasis on the outcome by having the same game plan each week. Athletes
who are able to do that can calm down and focus on what really makes them
swim faster (technique, biomechanics, tactics, and the game plan in the pool).
Even more exciting is that, almost without exception, those athletes who put
less emphasis on setting personal bests actually begin to set personal bests more
frequently. When that begins to happen, we change the game plan by averaging
the swimmers’ personal bests, and that is what they beat! It’s like a student going
to graduate school and leaving behind his undergraduate scores and grade point
average. Those undergraduate numbers just aren’t relevant in graduate school.
The same applies to leaving behind the old swim times.
Some U.S. athletes implemented and used this strategy of beating the aver-
age in preparing for and competing in the 2004 Athens, 2008 Beijing, and 2012
London Olympic Games. The plan must be used day in and day out in both
training and competition. Attempts to use this way of thinking only in competi-
tion without practicing it throughout the year in training have less probability of
working. A consistent finding in Athens, Beijing, and London was that athletes
approached the Games with a calmer and more focused belief system that was
based on a high probability for success (“All I have to do today is beat my average,
focus on my game plan, and maintain great biomechanics”). That approach led

--- Page 352 Text ---
|

to more medals and personal bests, simply because these athletes had learned
about probability and pursuing self-talk and belief systems that gave them the
best chance to be successful. They also reported that they were keenly aware
that many of their competitors were struggling with the issues they had finally
been able to let go. Many of our athletes became creative in wearing the visual
–
cue (> X) on a hand or foot as a regular reminder to keep them on track when
they competed.
Self-Talk
Most of our waking moments are consumed with what we call self-talk. Self-talk
is the internal monologue we carry on with ourselves, whenever we are not actu-
ally talking aloud with others. The body of knowledge associating self-talk with
performance outcomes in athletics and achievement is growing (Weinberg et al.
1984; Goodhart 1986; Gould, Eklund, and Jackson 1992; Van Raalte et al. 1994;
Hardy, Gammage, and Hall 2001). In the cited research, self-talk generally has
been used to self-calm or relax, self-educate, self-motivate, focus, self-reward,
self-criticize, and pass time. Self-talk can be directed inward or at others. It can
be constructive, destructive, positive, negative, and move us to or away from
action. Self-talk can be neutral or, in some cases, so quiet that we are not con-
sciously aware of the conversation being held. Lastly, self-talk can be believable
or not to the person carrying on the internal dialogue.
We often hear coaches or teammates encourage athletes to think positive,
focus, see themselves being champions, and more. But the extent to which
athletes truly believe what they are being encouraged to say to themselves has a
direct effect on whether the self-talk will have any bearing on their performances.
Self-talk that is positive and constructive in nature, when channeled in the right
direction, can result in improved performance. Unfortunately, self-talk that is
negative and destructive in nature will have a detrimental effect on performance.
As illustrated earlier in the gravity discussion, nonproductive self-talk tends to
be about the past or future, whereas constructive self-talk is aligned with the
present (“My job is to swim fast”). The objective of most sports is really pretty
simple; in the case of swimming, it’s to swim fast.
Most swimmers, thinking back to when they were younger, remember that
swimming fast was fun, even though they may not have recognized that they
were swimming in the moment or not really caring about the past or what might
lie ahead. Swimming for fun was as important as swimming fast. In fact, fun
and fast were often synonymous in the minds of great athletes. Unfortunately,
the business of sport has a way of systematically driving the fun out of sport
and replacing it with a prime focus of swimming fast, swimming faster, work-
ing hard, making money, and always setting personal bests. These seeds have
been planted, and they often grow into a full crop of negative self-talk that we
deal with in sport and in life. It is as if fun, hard work, and progressive improve-
ment cannot occur at the same time as swimmers become more seasoned and

move toward higher levels of competition. I wholeheartedly disagree with that
assumption. If fun is left out of the equation to swim fast, attempts to swim fast
will feel gravitational resistance. It’s like swimming against a current rather than
swimming with the current or being pulled through the water. The fast suits
have been taken out of the pool. If you want swimmers to swim fast, help them
put on fun suits. You will be amazed at the progress they make! Swimming fast
means teaching and learning the fundamentals of swimming. Sometimes the
key ingredients are obvious, but we forget to include them. Fun and the mental
part of swimming need to be included.
Swimming fast means reverting to the way of thinking we had when we were
younger, when we focused on the feeling of swimming fast rather than the abso-
lute and driven objective of swimming faster than everyone else in the pool.
The key is to swim faster than you did before. Own your lane! When a swimmer
can begin to do that, swimming faster will begin to take on an impressive life
of its own.
In the meantime, we have to contend with and remedy the culture associ-
ated with competitive sport that has evolved over the years. Unfortunately, a
less-than-positive atmosphere that often encourages the development and use
of negative self-dialogue has been unintentionally created for swimmers. The
following are some of the more common self-talk errors, as well as suggestions
to help swimmers convert negative self-talk statements to positive, constructive,
and productive self-talk statements.
Focusing on the Past or the Future
“I can’t believe I swam so terribly in my first event” (past) or “Now, every stroke
and turn of this next event has to be perfect to make up for my earlier bad swim”
(future). Not letting go of a mistake or poor performance takes the thoughts
and focus away from where they need to be—on the present moment and in the
present event! Continuing to carry on these past and future self-conversations
clutters up the connection between the body and the mind—physiologically,
biomechanically, and psychologically. This kind of self-talk often evolves into
a series of errors that contribute to unsuccessful performances. Instead, swim-
mers should strive to let the past performance go before even heading to the
pool for the next event. They need to focus on competing right here, right now,
and in this event.
Focusing on Real or Perceived Weaknesses
During the Competition
“I am the most inexperienced athlete here,” “I’ve never beaten her before,” or “I
should have trained harder.” Any of these statements might be true, but all are
irrelevant at the time of competition. During competition, swimmers who dwell
on what they don’t have may as well be tying weights to their ankles. Competi-
tion is a time when self-talk and mental focus should be fully directed to areas

--- Page 354 Text ---
|
Swimming Psychology: Merging Mind and Body 343
such as being technically and tactically proficient and sticking to the race plan.
Swimmers who think that they are at 80 percent of where they should be as
swimmers need to give the full 100 percent of that 80 percent (John Wooden and
Paul “Bear” Bryant). Thinking about or focusing on what they don’t have (skills,
absolute feel for the water, and so on) will simply take their swim times to the
slow side of the curve. The most logical way to increase performance percentage
is through additional deliberate training. Swimmers will not magically create
more without investing the time required to improve the requisite skills or fit-
ness level. Simply trying harder is not the answer. The key to swimming faster is
to work harder and smarter in training and then replicate that in competition.
Self-talk is most productive if swimmers think more about what they are bring-
ing to the pool rather than what they aren’t, or think they aren’t, bringing to the
pool. They will reach a point in their swimming careers where what they have
is enough to be successful. The trick is for them to focus on what they have and
then give that in the pool with an unwavering commitment.
Focusing on Ultimatum Outcome or Profit Only
“I must win,” “I have to finish in the top two,” or “I have to beat him.” Make
no mistake, in sport, as in any business, something is at stake! But the relation-
ship between what is at stake and how important that really is to a swimmer is
most clearly found in how healthy the swimmer’s perspective is about why she
competes. No doubt, every business must be profitable to stay afloat. But if profit
(winning) is the bottom-line reason that an athlete competes in sport, profits
will be lean and hard to come by in many of the years of competition. Swimmers
need to understand, know, and revisit the real reasons that they compete. If it
is only about winning, they will regularly be one stroke, one turn, or one hand
short of touching the wall behind those who understand the deeper levels of this
relationship. Focusing on the result (future) will take them out of the moment
and negatively affect their performance. When swimmers stay in the moment and
the process (swimming right now), then the probability of an outcome (profit or
success) will occur more frequently. If the focus is on the outcome (future), the
water just seems to get more difficult to move through as the event unfolds. In
the end, swimmers need to create a clear definition of how they define success,
in and out of the pool. Success isn’t always defined as winning. Swimmers have
all won races with a performance that they weren’t satisfied with. They have
all had races that they didn’t win but that felt great. And they might have had
a great time as well. The best race occurs when the swimmer has a great swim,
feels great, and wins! Success comes in a variety of forms. To stay in the game
and be profitable, swimmers need to focus on the process and in that moment.
Focusing on Uncontrollable Factors
“I don’t like this pool,” or “I don’t like this lane,” or “I don’t like this suit.”
Thoughts such as these are a waste of precious emotional energy because they

--- Page 355 Text ---
}
344 Bauman
focus on elements that are sometimes just out of the swimmer’s control. Uncon-
trollable factors are just that—out of the swimmer’s control. No matter how much
a swimmer complains about the pool, lane, water temperature, equipment, and
so on, it doesn’t change anything except that person’s attitude and energy level.
A good rule when planning is to expect things not to be perfect. That is the
business of performance and life. If something is not quite right, the message
should be “It is what it is” (Navy SEAL mantra). Get over it and get back in the
moment. Be solution oriented in responding to adversity. When encountering
an obstacle or challenge, a true competitor sees only two choices—ignore it or
fix it, but always move on!
Demanding Perfection
“I have to have a perfect race,” “I have to hit exactly the right splits,” or “I have
to look perfect.” Sport is about pursuing perfection, and that is all we really
do—pursue it. We can only approximate perfection. That is why every sport
has the built-in flexibility of not requiring participants to be perfect. The size
of a basketball hoop is larger than the basketball; a golf cup is bigger than the
golf ball. Except for the 25- and 50-meter events, swimmers have multiple pool
lengths to make up for a slightly missed turn or stroke. Striving for perfection is
a great attitude; demanding it is not. We just need to make a personal demand
to strive for it!
Identifying and Managing
Pressure (Hot Water Tanks)
Pressure to perform at higher levels throughout the year seems to be a common
characteristic of sport. Pressure is often considered the cause of failing to per-
form on demand. As baseball manager Tommy Lasorda once said, “Pressure is
a word that is misused in our vocabulary. When you start thinking of pressure,
it’s because you’ve started to think about failure.” Because this topic is a popu-
lar point of discussion, I want to introduce another analogy to explain where
pressure comes from, how that pressure is regulated, and what happens if we
don’t manage and rechannel the pressure in a constructive way leading up to
and during an athletic event.
All of us experience and appreciate the convenience and comfort of hot water
for baths, showers, and sinks. We can thank Benjamin Maughan, an English engi-
neer, who developed the modern version of the hot water heater in about 1868.
In about 1889 Edwin Rudd, a Norwegian mechanical engineer, used Maughan’s
designs to develop a container-based apparatus similar to what we use today.
Most hot-water tanks are closed containers made of a fiberglass material.
Residential hot water tanks are typically large enough to hold 50 to 60 gallons
(190 to 230 L) of cold water that is heated by a heat source (gas or electricity).
A thermostat on the hot-water tank senses the temperature of the water in the

--- Page 356 Text ---
|
Swimming Psychology: Merging Mind and Body 345
tank. As hot water is used, more cold water enters the tank to keep the tank
full. As the cold water is added to the tank, the water temperature falls below a
certain level, the thermostat senses the drop in temperature, and it restarts the
heat source so that hot water will be available the next time it’s needed. As the
water temperature increases and reaches the temperature set on the thermostat,
usually about 125 degrees Fahrenheit (52 degrees Celsius), the thermostat senses
that change and turns off the heat source. But what happens if the thermostat
malfunctions or is set too high? Physics tells us that if we continue to heat a
liquid in a closed container, the pressure in the container continues to rise. In
the hot-water heater, the pressure could rise to a level that exceeds the structural
ability of the water tank to handle the increasing inside pressure. In that case,
the tank would split or crack, and about 50 gallons of hot water would spill all
over the floor.
Recognizing this problem, today’s hot-water tanks include a safety device
called a pressure relief valve that is attached to the tank. When excess pressure
develops, the pressure relief valve automatically senses the problem. The valve
opens and allows the excess pressure (steam) to be released from the tank. This
system prevents the tank from breaking and spilling water all over the floor. The
problem will continue to present itself, however, if the temperature setting on
the thermostat is not corrected or the faulty thermostat is not replaced.
What does this have to do with athletes or swimming? Imagine that athletes,
like hot-water tanks, are closed containers filled with a liquid that can build up
pressure. Swimmers also have various sources of heat—coaches, parents, media,
sponsors, injuries, illness, life circumstances, travel, teammates, organizations,
possible financial gain or loss, the possibility of making a team—that can cause
pressure to build. The swimmer’s thermostat refers to the swimmer’s ability to
sense pressure when it is building and manage it in a way that does not interfere
with performance. An additional function of the performance thermostat is to
develop a set of strategies that can be used to develop and maintain a healthy
perspective on performance.
Also, like the hot-water tank, swimmers may have a pressure relief valve that
serves as a backup for the thermostat. Pressure relief valves can be coaches and
support staff that can assist when an athlete’s personal strategies don’t seem to
be working. When swimmers heat up from pressure, they expect the thermostat
(mental coping strategies) to kick in and take care of the increasing heat. These
strategies are addressed in this chapter. For those with an ongoing awareness
about healthy perspectives and regular applications of effective strategies, the
pressure is naturally monitored, managed, and channeled into constructive
behavior. For those who do not use these strategies, pressure can continue to
increase and have dramatic negative effects on performance as the athlete nears
the point of coming apart. Unfortunately, when the thermostat (strategies) isn’t
used and swimmers don’t check in with the pressure relief valve (coaches and
other support resources), the results can include panic, choking, anxiety, fear
response, increased vulnerability to illness or injury, slow recovery from injury,

decreased swimming technique, changes in mood, substance use or abuse, quit-
ting sport, and more.
Pressure itself is not entirely a negative element. Some athletes are able to
reframe, relabel, and use pressure to create more fuel for higher performances.
Some swimmers actually need more heat (pressure) to access performance levels
that they cannot tap into any other way. They don’t need a pressure relief valve.
They need more heat for higher performance.
All athletes need to identify and understand the sources of heat and pressure,
as well as the extent to which they affect mind-set and performance in either
productive or counterproductive ways. Athletes need to create a working set of
strategies (thermostat) to regulate their internal response to pressure. Finally,
they need to identify people who can serve as the pressure relief valve and assist
them in adjusting or reapplying performance strategies to get back on track. It
then becomes possible to either decrease the intensity and its negative effect on
performance or convert it into performance fuel.
Great athletes who consistently perform well understand that the real drug
of sport is that amazingly unique and energizing anticipatory excitement they
experience leading up to and right before the start. They know it is coming, and
they expect it to be there. They need it for that extra gear that training cannot
give them. It is the fuel of champions, and they have learned to embrace and
use it.
All swimmers can choose to use that special fuel to push or pull them through
the water (positive), or they can choose to use it to make them feel as if they
are pulling weights and swimming upstream! What’s more amazing is that ath-
letes can learn how to make the right choice. Having great technique and great
endurance takes time, smart work, hard work, and practice. Seeing and using
the pressure of competition as fuel takes practice, too.
Energy Management (Tachometers)
A tachometer is a gauge typically found on the instrument panel of a car. It tells
how many revolutions per minute (RPMs) the engine is turning at any giving
point. The higher the RPMs are, the harder the engine is working. The tachometer
reads 0 RPMs when the car is off, but when the car is started, the tachometer
needle jumps right up to around 1,500 to 2,000 RPMs before settling back down
to a quiet idling rate of about 900 RPMs. This idle speed simply keeps the engine
on, warm, ready, and using only enough fuel to stay running.
When the driver pushes down on the gas pedal, the tachometer needle imme-
diately jumps to a higher number on the gauge, indicating that the engine is
increasing its RPMs. Typically, the speed of the car is increasing as well. When a
car is in its top gear and just cruising along, most tachometers will read some-
where around 3,000 RPMs. If the engine is pushed too hard, the tachometer
will begin to register in the higher numbers on the gauge, which typically are
in bright orange or red, colors widely recognized for warning! In this case, the

--- Page 358 Text ---
|
Swimming Psychology: Merging Mind and Body 347
tachometer is warning the driver that the engine RPMs are dangerously high.
Malfunctions, poor performance, and even damage to the engine are likely.
Hitting that orange or red area on the gauge is a warning to shift gears so that
the RPMs get back down to a cruising range for the engine.
What does this have to do with swimming faster? In 1908 Yerkes and Dodson
developed the inverted U hypothesis, which offered a description of their research
describing the relationship between anxiety and performance (figure 16.3).
Briefly, they hypothesized that increasing anxiety (excitement or energy) was
positively and directly related to increasing performance to a particular point.
When the anxiety (excitement or energy) passed a certain threshold, performance
began to decline, proportionate to the increasing anxiety.
Later, Hardy and Fazey (1987) and Hardy and Parfitt (1991) expanded on
the earlier work and developed the catastrophe model, which considered both
physiological and psychological energy, rather than anxiety. By combining two
variables with performance, the catastrophe model alters the inverted U diagram
somewhat, but both hypotheses clearly propose an important relationship
between energy level (physiological and psychological) and performance. Ath-
letes need to identify their optimal energy level. Too little energy will result in
a flat performance, and too much energy will result in decreased performance
because of high anxiety (energy). Each sport and each athlete has a different
level of energy associated with performance needs. Distance swimmers have
their best energy levels to the left of midline on the inverted U, sprinters more
to the right, and middle-distance swimmers probably more toward the center
of the curve. Energy levels will need to be practiced through trial and error.
Just as car engines have a variety of RPM levels for peak performance, so do
swimmers.

As with most research and hypotheses, subsequent research often challenges
earlier findings. The work done by Yerkes and Dodson and Hardy is no excep-
tion. From an applied perspective, however, the relationship between levels of
physiological energy, psychological energy, and performance plays out every
day. Therefore, in my work, these models are valuable, and they make sense to
practitioners, coaches, and athletes.
Imagine superimposing the inverted U on a tachometer. You will quickly see
the relationship. Lower numbers on the tachometer correspond to lower levels of
energy on the inverted U. Redlining the tachometer corresponds to higher energy
and decreasing performance on the inverted U. The analogy of a tachometer to
represent things such as heart rate or physiological and psychological energy is
a good metric for engine performance, in cars and in swimmers.
As swimmers train and compete, they should begin to use an energy scale
similar to a tachometer to evaluate their performance. Imagine an internal
tachometer numbered from 1 to 8. The lower numbers are energy levels associ-
ated with being on idle, and the higher numbers are redlining, or being way too
energized. Each swimmer should find a number on the tachometer that represents
the cruising setting. Athletes need to think about really good performances and
associate them with a number on their tachometers. Before swimmers compete,
they can check their emotional energy by maintaining awareness of their internal
tachometers. As swimmers prepare to perform, their energy levels should begin
to rise to the cruising numbers, but not as far as the higher numbers (redline.)
Some well-known mechanisms to regulate energy include listening to music and
performing breathing exercises. Swimmers should use this tachometer strategy
before races and even during the races themselves. They can also regularly moni-
tor their anxiety levels using this strategy. The more practice athletes get using
this approach, the more likely they will be to monitor and raise or lower their
energy level to achieve the necessary arousal level when they step on the blocks.
Yellow Lights
Early in my driving career, I was taught that when approaching an intersection,
if the traffic light turned yellow, I was supposed to slow down and stop. Obvi-
ously, traffic intersections would be a bigger mess than they are now if we didn’t
have traffic lights to clear intersections. So, for years I believed that yellow lights
meant to slow down and stop. Later, I moved from rural America to southern
California and took my driving skills and beliefs about the rules of the road
with me. I soon realized, however, that the beliefs about driving in California
were much different from those in rural America. Yellow lights did not mean
slow down. They seemed to convey the message to speed up and get through the
intersection! In one of my first intersection experiences in California, I slowed
down for the yellow light and all the cars in the surrounding lanes flew through
the intersection. Simultaneously, I looked in my rearview mirror. Directly behind
me was a car fishtailing and braking hard to avoid rear-ending me. I could clearly

--- Page 360 Text ---
|
Swimming Psychology: Merging Mind and Body 349
make out the obscenities that driver was yelling at me through his windshield.
The lesson I learned in California was that yellow has a much different mean-
ing attached to it than what I had learned back home. Yellow means “go,” and
anyone who doesn’t go will be left at the light while everyone else moves on.
What does this have to do with sport? The same beliefs about yellow lights
and slowing down hold true when thinking about performance. As athletes get
tired from physical exertion, they begin to receive warnings (yellow lights) from
their bodies and they naturally begin to think about slowing down to relieve
that discomfort.
These uncomfortable intersections, which can occur at various points in dif-
ferent events, represent times when athletes have an opportunity to decide what
their bodies are really telling them. “Should I slow down or swim through the
yellow lights that my body is giving me?” What the body is really saying is that
here is an opportunity to go! Just like the yellow traffic lights in California, if a
swimmer slows down for the yellow, other swimmers (who likely are experienc-
ing the same yellow warning lights) will likely continue and may even speed
up to make it through the intersection.
Each time swimmers choose to run the yellow light in the pool, they move
closer to becoming a different athlete. Each time they give in and decide to slow
down for the yellow light, they will likely end up touching the wall behind the
other competitors, knowing all the while that they really could have pushed
through the yellow. Unfortunately, in the latter case, the swimmer will climb
out of the pool unchanged, the same athlete who dove in at the start. For swim-
mers to be different every time they swim, they need to run the yellow lights
in the pool. A necessary ingredient to move from the current level to a higher
level of performance is to push regularly to an uncomfortable level (run the
yellow light). There will be some resistance to being uncomfortable, but athletes
really have two clear choices. The first, as a swimmer, is to continue to push
through times of being physically and psychologically uncomfortable and get
better. The second, as a swimmer, is to remain at the current level of comfort
and simultaneously remain at the current performance level. The swimmer
makes the choice!
Fuel Gauges
We’ve already discussed one gauge in the performance dashboard of a car
(tachometer); another important indicator of a car’s performance and status is
the gas, or fuel, gauge. The fuel gauge provides a rough idea about how much
fuel is left in the tank. Most fuel systems in today’s cars also have an indicator
that illuminates when the car is low on fuel. When that light comes on, we usu-
ally think we are nearly out of fuel and had better head to the gas station to fill
up. When the light comes on, we may frantically change our driving plans and
start looking for a gas station so that we don’t run out of gas. But that light is just
another yellow orange warning light, one to be considered, but not necessarily

one that requires us to change our plans. Specifically, it tells us that we are low
on fuel and that we are now using reserve fuel to keep the car moving.
Nearly every athlete has experienced those sinking thoughts and self-talk
about being nearly out of fuel, during either a difficult training session or an
all-out competition. “Do I have enough fuel left to finish this set or race?” “What
if I don’t have enough fuel to finish and I don’t?” “How embarrassing is this
going to be if I just get smoked in this race?” “I’d better slow down so that I can
at least finish strong.” But if swimmers knew how far they could go after the
low-fuel light comes on, they would be able to push through that light to use
every last drop of gas without fear that they would run out before the race was
over. This information—how far we can go after the fuel light comes on—comes
from careful monitoring and self-testing during training.
For example, when I buy a vehicle, I fill up my 1-gallon (3.8 L) lawn mower
gas container, put it in the trunk of the car, and start driving. When the low-fuel
light illuminates, I push in the odometer button and reset the trip mileage to
zero. Then I drive until my car runs completely out of gas, the engine stops, and
I coast to a stop. A quick glance at the odometer tells me how many miles I have
driven since the fuel light came on. I now know exactly how far I can drive on
my reserve fuel. This piece of information is important to have for any machine,
including the body. When swimmers know how far they can go before the tank
runs out of gas and how fast they can swim to get there, a whole new realm of
racing options presents itself. Knowing this generates a new kind of self-talk: “I
have plenty in reserve, so let’s just kick it up a gear!”
Remember that yellow lights and low-fuel gauges are signals to keep going,
not to slow down or start worrying. Swimmers should challenge those old beliefs
by challenging the lights. Each time they make that decision, they will be on
their way to becoming a different and faster swimmer.
Pit Crews
Imagine what it would be like for a NASCAR or Indy race car driver to run a race
without a pit crew. That’s the way it was in the early days of racing (pre-1950s).
During the 1950s, the Wood Brothers were the first to choreograph pit stops for
their drivers. Before then, drivers raced the race and serviced their own cars.
As race distances increased, tracks got faster (dirt to asphalt and flat tracks to
banked curves), engines got bigger, speeds increased, and money for the winner
grew, just as it did for swimmers. A support crew became a necessity for any
driver who wanted to be successful. From that point on, the best crews became
a significant part of a racer’s success.
Efficiency and safety for the crewmembers soon became paramount. Regula-
tions began to limit the number of people allowed on the track to service the
driver and the car. In other sports, rules or available credentials restrict the
number of people in the competition area. The main ingredients to keeping the
car on the road seemed to be tires and fuel. So the pit crew became the jack man,

front-tire changer, front-tire carrier, back-tire changer, back-tire carrier, gasman,
and gas catcher. Every crew has a crew chief to coordinate the work of the crew,
but the chief is overseeing all that work from behind the wall.
The on-track crews are critical to the driver and the car for the preparation
leading up to the race, during the race, and after the race. But the driver and the
race team rely on the support of many essential off-track people, sponsors, and
organizations. In all sports, the evolution of athletes (bigger, stronger, faster,
and competing over longer durations and distances) and athletic competition
(more risky) has required increasing levels of efficiency in athletes, their equip-
ment, and the support crews.
In athletics, the pit crew concept is alive and well, but until now the similarities
between car racing and other sports have not been highlighted. Years ago, swim-
mers typically had their lone pit crewmember, the coach. The coach provided
everything the athlete might need to compete. But like NASCAR, competitive
swimming has changed; a crew of people is needed to support an athlete in
today’s competitive environment. A swimmer’s crew consists of coach, assistant
coaches, strength and conditioning coach, physiologist, biomechanist, high-
speed video technologist, medical staff, sport psychologist, sport nutritionist,
chiropractor, and massage therapist.
Like the NASCAR pit crew, these key players for a swimmer must also be
choreographed to provide the swimmer with the highest level of science and
collaborative effort to keep the swimmer in the race. Just as in NASCAR, a host
of others never seen by the casual observer are behind the wall, people just
as necessary to the swimmer’s success—family, friends, relationship partners,
teammates, clubs, organizations, other coaches, financial supporters, agents, and
more. Just like the pit crew, these supplemental support systems are important
to the overall effort to assist the athlete. Earlier in the discussion about hot-
water tanks, I mentioned the pressure relief valve as a backup to the thermostat
(personal strategies). All the pit crewmembers are the swimmer’s relief valves.
Swimmers should use them!
Summary
A swimming career is long and arduous. Being successful takes a lot of blood,
sweat, and tears. In the end, however, a swimming career can be one of the most
rewarding and fun-filled careers that any athlete can experience. Swimmers learn
lessons about themselves, life, where they have been, where they are going, and
how they will get there. To synchronize their minds with their bodies and swim
faster, swimmers need to practice and use the strategies outlined in this chapter.
They can maintain an effective mind and body connection by
• adopting a new perspective of mental pliability,
• consistently recalculating and beating their average times in events in which

yellow lights),

CHAPTER
Growth and
Development
—Anne Pankhurst, PhD
This chapter is concerned with the growth, maturation, and development of
every child and young person on the path to becoming an adult. Therefore,
the information is not only about swimmers or even young athletes but also about
the growth and development process that every young person goes through. Cer-
tainly, for swimming coaches to work appropriately and effectively with young
people, they must be knowledgeable about growth and development and, more
important, be able to apply those concepts in their daily activities and behav-
iors. Parents and sport or club officials are also stakeholders in the process of
developing young people in sport; they, too, should be aware of the information
and understand its implications for every young athlete in a coaching program.
This chapter first discusses growth, maturation, and development as it relates
to young athletes, and it then outlines the implications of each for coaches. The
final section of the chapter discusses how practice should be structured at dif-
ferent stages of athlete development to provide a developmentally appropriate
swimming experience.
Defining Growth, Maturation,
and Development
Two important issues deserve some discussion and clarification before we move
forward. First, the terms growth, maturation, and development, although linked,
are distinct entities. Therefore, they will be defined and discussed individually.
In terms of coaching young athletes, however, the close links they have to each
other and the manner in which they affect each other are important for any
coach who works with developing swimmers to know and understand.
353

Additionally, although every child follows the same general pattern of
growth and maturation, each child is an individual in the sense that the timing
and tempo of her progress through the stages of growth and maturation will
be unique. The fact that the timing of progress toward adulthood takes place
individually is a central tenet to this chapter. Because of the nonuniformity of
individual athlete development, coaches, parents, and systems find it extremely
difficult to compare one child with another, especially during periods of rapid
growth such as puberty. As athletes grow and mature, each child likely will be at
a different stage of development than others within his peer group (Baxter-Jones
and Sherar 2007; Buenen and Malina 2008). These differences can be especially
marked during puberty and can persist until the growth and development process
has concluded (i.e., adulthood).
A key item for coaches to realize is that because each child has the potential to
progress at a different tempo than other swimmers in the same training group,
they may need to adjust their coaching styles, techniques, and areas of focus
to provide a developmentally appropriate training and competitive experience.
Realistically, only as adults can people be accurately compared in terms of athletic
performance. But that does not seem to prevent people from making compari-
sons and making decisions about talent when athletes are very young! To give
a practical example, two 12-year-olds competing at a swim meet could appear
to have the same technical abilities and skills. But because they are in different
stages of growth and maturation (perhaps one is small and immature and the
other is tall and nearing adulthood), their ability to perform will be influenced
simply by their physical size and abilities, their different levels of strength and
speed. To compare them in terms of the outcome of the race, or worse, to state
that one is more talented than the other based on physical ability is inappropriate.
Because of the training and competitive requirements of sport, the individual’s
rate of growth and maturation has a tremendous effect on performance.
Consequently, anyone involved in youth or junior sport should understand
the processes of growth, maturation, and development because those elements
will affect every young person. Coaches and parents are the stakeholders most
closely associated with young athletes. For them, this knowledge and understand-
ing is crucial if young people are to develop their potential, whether as Olympic
champions or as recreational swimmers. Both parents and coaches influence
athlete development all along the developmental pathway. How then are the
terms growth, maturation, and development defined, how are they manifested, and
what are their implications for coaching practice?
Growth
Growth refers to increases in the size of a person, in terms of either the body
as a whole or the individual limb segments (arms, legs, and trunk). Typically,
growth results in an increase in height (stature), weight (body mass), organ size
(e.g., heart and lungs), and the size of the skeletal system (Malina, Bouchard,
and Bar-Or 2004). Therefore, growth is a dynamic and actual change in the size,

|
Growth and Development 355
shape, and structure of the body itself or its parts. Some elements of growth
such as height (stature), size of segments, and weight (body mass) are observable
and measurable. These variables normally are tracked for young people regu-
larly by medical practitioners. But growth in young athletes can (and should)
be measured regularly by coaches as well to determine the approximate stage
of development of each swimmer. Some previous knowledge of normal growth
and development is useful for a coach and can provide some insight as to what
each athlete will look like in the future. For example, on average girls reach
75 percent of their adult height by 7.5 years of age and boys by 9 years of age.
Typically, girls have attained 90 percent of their adult height at 11.5 years and
boys at 13.5 years. In the case of stature or height, predicting full adult height is
relatively easy (Beunen 2001) using straightforward testing or medical records.
One of the keys for coaches to understand and take into account is that growth
is not steady throughout childhood or adolescence; the velocity of growth (rate
of increase) is different at different stages. Whether a swimmer is experiencing
a period of rapid or slow growth can affect training and competitive success.
Five stages of growth before adulthood are recognized, and each has a differ-
ent rate-of-growth pattern. Note that all age ranges given here are averages, so
take care in deciding how individual children fit into the stages.
1. From birth until 2 or 3 years of age, the child grows rapidly and increases in
stature, up to 12 inches (30 cm) in the first year. By the age of 2, the average
child has attained 50 percent of her adult stature.
2. During childhood (defined as 4 to 10 years of age), the growth rate deceler-
ates considerably and settles in to a steady rate of around 2 to 3 inches (5 to
7.5 cm) per year, although many 6- to 8-year-olds experience a midgrowth
spurt during which the rate of growth increases slightly.
3. During the prepubertal stage (between the ages of 8 or 9 and 12, although
it may occur earlier or later depending on gender), the young person begins
the growth spurt. This is called the onset of peak height velocity (PHV).
4. During puberty, the growth spurt is characterized by another rapid increase
in height until the person achieves PHV, the period of most rapid growth.
5. The postpuberty period follows the growth spurt and PHV. This period of
slower growth continues until adulthood.
Increases in body mass (weight) follow the same general pattern described for
increases in stature, but they come later and are delayed relative to the increases in
height (height gains precede weight gains). The term peak weight velocity (PWV)
is given to the peak rate of increase in body mass (Baxter-Jones and Sherar 2007).
On average, boys ultimately end up being both taller and heavier than girls.
Coaches and parents need to understand that although these stages are
often linked to chronological age, the data indicate only the average age when
these growth phases occur. The fact that most children and young people are
not average means that many will be either ahead or behind the average age.

--- Page 367 Text ---
}
356 Pankhurst
For example, a swimmer who is experiencing normal growth can be shorter or
taller than another child at the same chronological age and can weigh less or
more. These growth factors have implications for swimmers and their ability
to perform specific skills because both PHV and PWV affect physical develop-
ment.
The velocity of the increase in stature is a more important measure than the
actual increase in height because it gives a real indication of the onset of puberty.
Puberty is marked by a rapid increase in height, but the rate of this increase is
what matters most in terms of coaching. We have already seen that children
under 8 or 10 years of age (remember, this is the average age) are growing steadily
and slowly. As the rate of growth increases, the difference between one height
measurement and the next can be measured and recorded. The point at which
the rapid increase in velocity begins is known as the onset of PHV, and it sig-
nals the start of the growth spurt. For a varying period of months, every young
person will grow rapidly until he reaches peak height velocity (PHV), the point
at which growth rate is maximal and then starts to slow down.
During growth, maturation is also taking place. The period of much slower
steady growth that follows the growth spurt can continue until 16, 18, or even
20 years of age, depending on gender. This stage is known as postpuberty. Adult-
hood is indicated when growth (and maturation) is finally complete.
Maturation
Maturation is the term used to define the coming of age processes experienced by
the biological systems of the body—the skeletal, sexual, hormonal, and neural
systems—as they develop. Maturation is a dynamic process of change because the
various systems progress toward the adult biological state at different rates and
tempos, both within the same person (i.e., not all systems may develop at the same
rate) as well as between people (i.e., individuals may mature at different rates).
The stages of maturation are similar to and parallel to those listed for growth.
As examples of this, childhood (ages 4 to 10) is the stage at which maturation
of the skeletal and neural systems primarily occurs. Additionally, maturational
changes to the sexual and hormonal systems are known to begin in prepuberty
and are particularly evident during puberty. These maturational processes affect
every young person, but the timing and tempo take place on an individual
timetable and therefore will be different for each person in a manner similar
to growth.
The indicators of maturation are clearly different for boys and girls (see the
section on gender for more information). For example, girls have a biological
marker similar to that of PHV that will signal the maturation of the sexual
system: the onset of the menstrual cycle (menarche), which, for the vast majority
of girls, takes place within a few months of PHV. The sexual characteristics of
boys (e.g., genital changes, body hair, and voice changes) all mature at different
stages and not necessarily in the same order for each male, making it difficult
for all but qualified medical practitioners to judge a boy’s stage of maturation.

Growth and Development 357
Coaches should keep a watchful eye for elements of growth and maturation
that can be observed even if they cannot be measured. Observation assumes
that coaches know what to look for and can understand the implications for
coaching practice in what they observe. In addition, in exactly the same way
that growth occurs, maturation takes place at different times for young people
of the same age. Young athletes can be either early, average, or late maturers in
relation to their peers of the same age. Parents are a useful resource for coaches;
parents naturally will be more aware of maturational changes than coaches, and
they can help coaches understand where a swimmer stands in the maturational
process (another reason for maintaining good relationships with parents).
Clearly, the two processes of growth and maturation are biological in nature
and unavoidable in practice; they take place at some stage in every young person.
Maturation has implications for a young athlete’s ability to perform specific
skills in sport, especially when athletes are grouped with others of the same age.
Young people may also temporarily lose skills as they mature and move through
puberty because of, for example, increases in limb lengths and changing body
proportions that affect coordination.
Development
Development is a different concept from either growth or maturity. It refers to
two distinct factors in the progress of young people toward adulthood. First, the
term signifies the status of the various biological systems of the body as the young
person gets older. Second, it relates to athlete behavior and skill development, ele-
ments that can be observed and assessed in terms of the acquisition and increasing
competence in various skills over time. In particular, coaches can witness this as
young athletes develop and expand their repertoire of physical, physiological,
emotional, intellectual, and social skills. Two issues are important for coaches:
1. The rate of development in the various factors is nonlinear. A swimmer’s
ability in one factor is unrelated and inconsequential to his ability in
another. For example, just because a young athlete has advanced physi-
cal skills, there is no reason to assume that he will have advanced or even
normal social skills or emotional control. In reality, although this young
person may be growing and maturing physically ahead of his peer group,
his mental or emotional skills may lag behind or be more developed than
his physical abilities.
2. Every child or young person acquires skills and abilities at a different age and
stage, often depending on her environment. Each athlete is unique in terms
of how she will progress through growth, maturation, and development.
Implications for Coaches
The processes of growth, maturation, and development are at work in all young
children and adolescents. Certainly, these processes should affect coaching

--- Page 369 Text ---
}
358 Pankhurst
practice and behavior. Those implications are discussed in detail throughout
this section.
The fact that young athletes grow and mature at different rates and chrono-
logical ages is theoretically and practically important for coaches. The implica-
tion for the young athlete is that the playing field will always be uneven until
everyone has reached adulthood. Only then can an apples-to-apples comparison
truly be made.
Furthermore, at least initially, that unevenness will largely be tipped in favor
of children who grow and mature earlier than others do. In some aspects, the
early maturers keep their perceived advantage into adulthood, but coaches need
to work out where each young athlete is on the developmental pathway and take
that into account when designing training plans, scheduling competition, and
building relationships. For example, the coach must consider whether coaching
adolescent athletes in chronological age groups constitutes best practice. The
more beneficial approach may be to give athletes an opportunity to train with
a group of developmentally comparable swimmers. To confuse the situation
further, physical and physiological development do not necessarily match the
rate of a young swimmer’s psychological development, so being placed in a dif-
ferent chronological age group may not be the right solution for a young person.
Often, the advantages of height and maturity mean that these youngsters are
likely to be more successful and so could or should be in a different (higher-level)
training group. Coaches also may believe they should select the more successful
young athletes for more training and competition without considering that they
are still immature in other respects. The athlete’s level of mental, emotional, or
social maturity may mean that training with his peer group is more enjoyable,
despite the differences in physical ability.
To compound the issue even further, because young people gain confidence
from success and success is perceived to be indicator of competence, late maturers
who are not successful can lose confidence when their more successful peers are
in the same training or competition group. Such actions can be discouraging for
the late developers who are not selected for the all-star team or the elite group.
Consequently, many leave a sport in which they perceive themselves to be inferior
to their peers. If these same late maturers are looked after, however, they often
catch up and become more successful than the early maturers, if they are still in
the sport. So placing young athletes in groups can make for tough coaching deci-
sions. Clearly, coaches face a formidable challenge in providing all developing
swimmers with an environment that will foster long-term enjoyment and success.
Monitoring Young Athletes’ Performance
The implications of growth and maturation are that coaches need methods for
monitoring the stage of development of each young person to know where he
is in the development curve (Malina and Beunen 2008). If involvement in the
sport is increasing and moving from recreational to competitive participation, the
frequency of this monitoring should increase and go deeper than mere observa-

Growth and Development 359
tion. Regular height and weight measurements that are recorded and monitored
can be important and useful. As previously mentioned, measuring the rate of
height increase can be a valuable tool for identifying where the youngster is in
the growth and maturation process as a whole or in the growth spurt in par-
ticular. A steady increase in weight should be expected and recorded, especially
for young athletes who have a high training load. A loss of weight in any young
athlete should raise a red flag and be investigated. Recording the rate of growth
(i.e., the change in height or weight over a consistent and regular time interval),
performing and recording regular skill testing, maintaining injury records,
and keeping regular contact with parents will help coaches determine where a
young athlete is on the developmental pathway (Beunen 2001). Good practice
in coaching young people means that coaches should have sound evidence of
where each athlete is in terms of development and not rely on chronological
age as the sole indicator.
The biological outcomes of growth and maturation also affect what can, and
should, be trained and when. The athlete development research indicates that
biological age—where the athlete is developmentally—is much more important
than the chronological age of a young athlete (Bloom 1985; Bompa 2000). Physi-
cal skills and capacities, for example, are affected by growth and maturation,
and therefore any training of them should be linked to the growth spurt and
biological age, not the swimmer’s chronological age. Differences will also be
found between genders, but less research has been done on the development of
physical capacities in girls than in boys. Take into account the following:
• A young person who is growing rapidly may be taller but not necessarily
stronger or faster and will almost certainly lose some coordination tem-
porarily as limb lengths increase and are out of proportion to the trunk.
• Different types of strength, or strength attributes, develop at different
rates and times, and coaches need to understand all of them to train them
effectively. Muscular, static, and explosive strength development in boys
begins during the growth spurt and reaches a peak up to a year after PHV.
• Muscle growth takes time to catch up with skeletal growth (skeletal growth
precedes muscle growth), and care should be taken with any strength train-
ing of young athletes during puberty.
• The increase in weight (PWV) comes after PHV. Coaches need to remember
that the body first increases rapidly in stature (PHV) and then increases in
overall size—muscle mass, weight (PWV), and strength (PSV).
• The best opportunities to improve and increase flexibility and speed of the
limbs and the body as a whole precede PHV. Therefore, flexibility and speed
should be developed before strength (Beunen and Malina 2008).
• The propensity for injury increases, especially during puberty, if training
type and volume is too high or is too repetitive of the same skills.
• Young people tire more quickly and easily, so rest and recovery are even
more important (see section later in this chapter).

--- Page 371 Text ---
}
360 Pankhurst
• Consequently, the development of strength, speed, flexibility, and other
physical capacities must be carefully monitored by coaches during puberty
and postpuberty. Specific physical tests can be used to monitor the develop-
ment of all physical capacities.
Clearly, when working with groups of young athletes on physical development,
variations will occur in who can do what and when. One method of overcoming
this issue is to have swimmers train physical skills in specific groups—prepuberty,
puberty, and postpuberty—to ensure that the training methodology, volume,
and intensity of work are appropriate. All these factors can be incorporated under
the banner of providing developmentally appropriate training.
Physiological Factors That Affect Training
Besides physical factors, a number of physiological parameters affect the abil-
ity of a young maturing athlete to train and compete. The processes of growth,
maturation, and development have a major effect on the ability of young athletes
to leverage the physiological attributes that are commonly seen as a normal part
of adult performance. An important mantra to follow is that young athletes are
not simply miniature adults and should not be expected to behave in the same
way. Junior athletes develop physiological attributes and capacities as they grow
and mature. As an example, although aerobic function is a key contributor to
performance in all athletes, aerobic capacity is not fully developed in young
athletes and therefore it should not be trained in the same way that it is in adults.
Consider the following:
• Younger athletes have smaller hearts and lower blood volume.
• Developing athletes have a higher heart rate and a lower stroke volume (the
amount of blood ejected from the left ventricle per cardiac contraction)
compared with adults.
• Children and adolescents have less ability to extract oxygen from the air as
they work. The result is that they have to take faster breaths to deliver the
same amount of oxygen to working muscles as adults do.
• Prepubescent athletes have a less efficient energy system in terms of pro-
ducing lactate because they use more fat than glycogen or glucose to fuel
performance compared with adults.
• Younger athletes are often less aware of the effect of a training load and
the need for rest.
• Children have a lower proportion of muscle in relation to body mass, so
they have to work harder to achieve the same or lower outcome of work as
an adult at the same task.
Taken as a whole, these factors affect how a coach trains a young swimmer
compared with athletes who have gone through puberty.

Growth and Development 361
Fluid Balance and Temperature Regulation
Even when taking their smaller size into account, children and prepubertal
athletes have greater skin surface area, relative to adults, and experience higher
blood flow to the skin than pubertal athletes or adults do. Because the skin is
exposed to the environment, young athletes consequently have greater difficulty
with thermoregulation, or the ability to regulate their temperature, than older
athletes do. In addition, young athletes take longer to acclimate to changes in
ambient temperature than adults do (Williams 2007). Although children can
typically tolerate exercise in normal temperatures, in hot or cold temperatures
their thermoregulation is limited and more difficult; consequently, they are less
able to tolerate exercise in hot or cold conditions.
Finally, children and young athletes are poor at recognizing thirst and thus
fluid deficiency. They become dehydrated more easily and more frequently than
adults do. Coaches need to build rest and fluid breaks into the training schedule
and sessions and then monitor the amount of fluid that they consume.
Psychological Development
Growth and maturation also affect the development of mental, emotional, and
social skills, which follow a pattern similar to that of physical development.
With that said, a number of psychological skills can be developed at various ages
in immature and developing young people (MacNamara, Button, and Collins
2010). For example, perceived competence, commitment, self-confidence, self-
reliance, and coping under pressure can begin to be developed during puberty
(Eklund and Gould 2008; MacNamara, Button, and Collins 2010; Weiss, Bhalla,
and Price 2008). Coaches should know how to develop those skills by using
appropriate coaching practices and coaching environments at different stages
of the developmental pathway.
Training and Competition
The processes of growth and maturation obviously affect both training and
competition. Bloom (1985) and Bompa (2000) suggested that coaches should
always take into account an athlete’s biological age in designing a plan to develop
her physical and technical skill base appropriately and successfully. Balyi and
Williams (2010) also suggested that knowing the athlete’s biological age would
help coaches deliver developmentally appropriate training and competition.
The evidence given thus far in this chapter is that technical development will be
either limited or enhanced by the level of physical development. Young people
moving through puberty will not have the same range of physical skills that fully
mature athletes do, and they will also find that their skills and abilities will ebb
and flow during periods of rapid growth. Even young children can experience
balance problems because of the relative size and weight of their heads during
childhood.

Organizing and conducting training and practice is obviously part of the
coach’s role. The research in the area of practice and training design is clear:
The age and stage of athlete development is an important consideration in
determining practice and training programs for young athletes. Again, but in a
different context, growth, maturation, and development affect the type, volume,
and purpose of training. Consider the following coaching points that can be
integrated into a swimming training and competitive framework:
• Developmentally, prepubescent children need a more fun and playful envi-
ronment. Short periods of varied activities will fit their psychosocial needs
(Baker and Côté 2006; Côté and Lidor 2013).
• Learning basic skills is easier and more productive during the steady growth
of either childhood or postpuberty than it is when the athlete is growing
and maturing rapidly (e.g., puberty).
• During childhood, children need to experience a wide variety of sports at
a low overall volume.
• As young athletes increase in maturity and develop a higher-quality skill
base, deliberate practice among developing swimmers can be effective.
Deliberate practice (characterized by increased training volume, intensity,
and lack of immediate reward) is certainly a more appropriate form of
practice for young people in puberty and postpuberty than it is for children
and prepuberty young people. Before volume is added (deliberate practice
involves repetition and long periods of the same practice; Hambrick et al.
2013), coaches should devise different types of practice methods that spe-
cifically improve performance and skills for young athletes.
• The ratio of practice to competition should be an important consideration
for coaches. Practice volume, and especially competition volume, should
be lower in childhood and prepuberty compared with later stages of devel-
opment.
Finally, within this context are the concepts of trainability and readiness.
Trainability refers to the actual ability of the athlete to respond to training of
a specific skill, meaning that the athlete has the physical and physiological
capability to learn that skill at that time. Clearly, trainability links to the stage
of growth, maturation, and development of the individual athlete. Readiness,
however, also links to the psychosocial development of the athlete, which, as
discussed earlier, may or may not be in line with biological growth and matu-
ration. Readiness is linked to trainability, but both concepts affect the training
of young people.
Proper Training
Proper training techniques for the young athlete are imperative. To become well-
rounded athletes and people, children need to be taught the skills of various

sports. As a foundation, before young athletes can excel in any sport they first
need to learn the basics of movement and have opportunities to develop a vari-
ety of skills. The outcome is that they acquire coordination (the organization of
motor firing patterns that lead to efficiency of muscle activation), body control
when moving and changing direction (agility), and static and dynamic balance
in a variety of ways. Evidence indicates that concentrating on one sport too early
in life can be detrimental to the development of athletic skills. Coordination,
agility, and balance underpin the biomechanics of swimming technique, and
the mastery of these skills can enhance performance in adolescence and over a
lifetime. Besides providing a greater skill base, multisport involvement early in
life can help to decrease the risk of injury in young athletes. In contrast, improper
learning and concentration on one sport in childhood can lead to injury.
Young Athletes and Competition
Competitive success or failure in young athletes is significantly influenced by
their level of maturation and development. Coaches need to appreciate that
fact, because although success is important, why a particular young person is
successful is potentially a more important piece of information. Is it because the
athlete was simply bigger and stronger? In that case, success could be temporary
until the late maturers catch up. Is it because that athlete had more coaching?
In that case, the skill level should be higher. Or is it because the athlete has real
potential? To answer this question, the coach must understand what potential
and talent are and how they are manifested in young athletes.
Baxter-Jones (1995) determined that junior competitive success cannot be
used as an indicator of talent or future successful performance. The reality of
junior competition is that young athletes perform inconsistently as they progress
through puberty. Early maturers have such physical advantages over their peers
that they succeed initially but only temporarily. The existing junior competitive
framework, except in rare instances, does not takes into account the skeletal or
biological age of young athletes (Bompa 2000). These ages and their influence
on performance and training design are discussed in the next section.
In addition, coaches need to be sure of the purpose of competition for junior
athletes and make sure that the reasons driving competition are developmentally
appropriate. Adult and junior competitive systems have different characteristics.
Junior athletes normally compete in competitive systems that are chronologically
age based, usually with two-year age banding, a feature that is absent in adult
competition. Further, the relative age effect (RAE), discussed in the next section,
highlights the fact that differences in success can be attributed, in some cases,
simply to the month in which a child was born. Often, competitive outcomes are
taken as an indication of talent in a young athlete, although the evidence indi-
cates little connection between junior success and adult success (Pankhurst and
Collins 2013). Thus, coaches need to be sure that they relate competitive success
to each young athlete’s status in terms of growth, maturation, and development.

Different Ages in Athlete Development
The processes of growth, maturation, and development have further ramifications
in creating a number of age classifications for young people. We have already
referred to the fact that junior competition tends to takes place in chronological
age groups. But the previous discussion of the various aspects of growth and
maturation has already indicated that chronological age can be a poor determi-
nant of the real age of a young person. Bompa (2000), for example, discusses
anatomical (skeletal) and biological age. The phenomenon of the relative age
effect is well known in junior sport research and practice. Sport age should also
be added to this list. Every coach who works with young people should under-
stand the effect of each of these ages to the extent that it affects and guides
coaching practice.
Chronological Age
Chronological age is the age on the birth certificate and the age used in com-
petition in almost all junior sport. Therefore, competition will clearly favor the
early maturer who will inevitably be bigger, stronger, and faster than the late
maturer of the same chronological age. But growth and maturation are constantly
changing. Malina, Bouchard, and Bar-Or (2004) pointed out that performance
of prepubertal and puberty athletes of the same chronological age varies over
even short periods. Thus, competitive results during these two developmental
stages are almost random in nature. Coincidentally, these factors highlight
major flaws in any selection process that ostensibly tests for talent in young,
immature athletes.
Skeletal Age
Skeletal age provides an estimate of maturation of the skeletal system by mea-
suring aspects of bone length and structure. Skeletal maturation is indicated
by increased bone development and a decrease in cartilage. Skeletal age can be
assessed by experts using various measurement methods. The most common
is to use a plain radiograph of the left hand and wrist to evaluate bone age and
examine the growth plates. (When growth has ceased, the growth plates between
the long bones and the ends of the bones will fuse.) Skeletal age is important
in sport because it affects the ability of young athletes to train for, develop, and
perform specific athletic skills.
Biological Age
In a similar manner to skeletal age, the biological age of a young person does
not necessarily follow birthdays (chronological age) or the calendar. Biological
age indicates the level of maturation of the various biological systems. It can be
determined only by a thorough understanding of the processes of maturation
and development of those systems. Again, in terms of athlete development,
biological age is more important than chronological age. Much athlete develop-

|
Growth and Development 365
ment research (Bloom 1985; Bompa 2000) suggests that coaches should always
take account of biological age to develop an athlete’s physical and technical
skill base appropriately and successfully. Balyi and Williams (2010) took this
further in indicating that coaches should know how to deliver developmentally
appropriate training and how to set up a competitive schedule appropriate to the
athlete’s biological age.
Relative Age
Research and experience both indicate that children born at the beginning of
a year are inevitably more mature than those born at the end. This phenom-
enon is known as the relative age effect (RAE). It follows that the younger the
child is in the same chronological year, the greater the propensity will be for
differences to be seen in the levels of maturity between him and children born
earlier in that year. Note that the year does not necessarily run from January to
December; it may be the school year from August to July or a sport year from
September to August. Education systems have understood the outcomes of RAE
for many years. Children who are born later in the year are inevitably younger
and often understandably less able than their peers are. Research (Edgar and
O’Donoghue 2005; Morris and Nevill 2006; Musch and Grondin 2001) on the
effect of relative age in the junior competitive context is both extensive and
important for coaches and parents. Actual results are clear—children born in
the first half of the sport year are far more likely to achieve competitive success
than those born later, and this advantage often carries on beyond puberty. The
age-group competitions typical of junior sport are often in two-year age bands,
further compounding the issue. A child born at the end of the two-year cycle
can be nearly two years younger than a child born at the beginning of the cycle.
Coaches need to understand that RAE is a factor that can be compounded even
more by early and late maturation.
Sport Age
Inevitably, young people take up a sport at different (chronological) ages and
times. Therefore, in a given period, they will have had more or fewer oppor-
tunities to learn the necessary skills. Some will have had more coaching and
more access to facilities than others, so their experience or abilities should be
greater. When making value judgments about young people’s abilities in a sport,
coaches need to take into account the sport age of each individual and link that
to biological age.
Implications of Different Ages in Athlete
Development
It would seem obvious that coaches should understand and take into account
different ages when designing training and competition environments because
they will affect a young athlete’s ability and enjoyment in a sport at a given time.

--- Page 377 Text ---
}
366 Pankhurst
But it is often the case that the implications of skeletal age, RAE, and sport age
are either unknown or misunderstood by coaches and therefore are not taken
into account in coaching practice. This issue is especially important when coach-
ing a group of young people of chronological ages 9 to 11. Within that group
could be young athletes with biological ages ranging from 8 (late maturers) to
14 (early maturers). Some could be born in January of one year, and others could
be born in December of the following year; some could have been taking part
in the sport for four years, and others just one. In terms of mental and emo-
tional development, some in the group will be children and others will be in
the middle of puberty. Coaches who are trying to conduct quality coaching in
such circumstances can and must treat every person as an individual, but they
also need to be aware of making judgments about standards of performance
and contrasting one person’s abilities with another’s.
Notes on Gender
The effects of the obvious gender differences become more apparent and impor-
tant in the coaching context as young male and female athletes grow and mature.
Consider the following examples and differences between boys and girls and
the way in which they develop:
• In terms of growth (Baxter-Jones and Sherar 2007), girls reach PHV up to
two years ahead of boys.
• In terms of final stature, however, boys usually end up being between 5 and
6 inches (between 12.5 and 15 cm) taller than girls. The principal reason
for this is that boys have a longer growth window compared with girls;
they experience continued, steady growth while girls are in their growth
spurt. The result is that after boys have completed their own growth spurt
(two years later), they have had a longer opportunity to experience growth.
• Children of both genders typically have a body-fat level of 16 to 18 percent.
But when discussed in terms of developmental increases and distribution
of weight, although young people of both genders become heavier during
periods of growth, for boys the increase in weight comes primarily from
increases in muscle mass and skeletal tissue. For girls, the increase in muscle
mass is less compared with boys, and a much greater increase occurs in fat
mass. Boys may even decrease their body-fat percentage with growth and
maturation. The percentage of fat mass is an indicator of gender; females
have a higher percentage (24 to 28 percent) than males (16 to 18 percent)
do postpuberty.
• Partly because of the distribution of fat mass, girls tend to have both a lower
center of gravity and a different body shape than boys. This body shape is
evidenced by wider shoulders (an increase in the biacromial diameter) and
more muscle for boys and wider hips (an increase in the biiliac diameter)
for girls. The differences in muscle mass in the shoulder girdle between the

--- Page 378 Text ---
|
Growth and Development 367
genders accounts for strength differences after puberty, and the lower center
of gravity for girls gives them better balance.
• The increased width of the hips in females does increase the Q angle (the
angle of the knees in relation to the hips) and can affect quadriceps muscle
development. Differences are also seen in trunk length (boys have longer
trunks than girls) and in arm length (again longer in boys).
• Postpuberty, physiological differences also become apparent between males
and females. Males have larger hearts and lungs. Testosterone increases the
blood hemoglobin and the number of red blood cells, so males can carry 11
percent more oxygen per liter of blood on average compared with females.
• The onset of the menstrual cycle for girls occurs at PHV (Rogol 2008). Often
the menstrual cycle means that girls need more iron (because they lose
iron during menstruation) and calcium, so diet becomes very important
for female athletes.
Coaches need to be aware of the information relating to gender differences.
Although these differences are almost nonexistent in children, they are very
apparent postpuberty. These differences affect physical and physiological per-
formance. The items described here relate principally to issues of growth and
maturation, but psychological, mental, and emotional differences between the
genders are known to exist and will also affect performance and thus coaching
practice. Although coaching practice for girls and boys prepuberty can be similar,
during and after maturation coaching practice should recognize the differences
between the genders.
Ethnicity
Recent research on the age of sexual maturation indicates a lowering of the age
at which boys mature in different ethnic groups, adding to previous and similar
research on girls (Herman-Giddens et al. 2012). For girls the average age for the
onset of puberty, which was 12.5 years in 1980, shifted to 10.5 years in 2010.
The figures for boys are similar, but on average lag a year behind the girls. This
research also indicates that the average age of maturity varies for different ethnic
groups; the maturation of African American girls can now begin at 8.8 years of
age, earlier than it is for white Caucasian girls (9.9 years). For boys the trend is
similar in the United States. African American boys mature first, and Hispanic
boys mature a little earlier than white Caucasian boys do. Current practice indi-
cates that such research is unknown to coaches and that the implications are
misunderstood by sport organizations, coaches, and parents alike.
Differences in ethnicity have been shown to affect growth, maturation, and
development. The consequence is that coaches need to take account of ethnic
background and reconsider their thinking on age and stage of development in
relation to physical and physiological training and what is possible and when
for different athletes.

Coaching Practices at Different Ages
The knowledge, techniques, and behaviors that coaches use at different stages
and ages of athlete development can affect the enjoyment and performance of
the swimmers they teach. High-quality coaching based on an understanding of
growth and development and infused with developmentally appropriate teaching
is especially important to the process of shaping young people as well as athletes.
Côté et al. (2010) noted that coaches need different skills to meet the needs of
young athletes at different stages of the performance pathway. This chapter has
given information on the importance of coach knowledge about the processes
of growth, maturation, and development and has provided some examples of
how growth and development principles can be integrated into a training and
competition plan. But all the knowledge available will not compensate for an
absence of other critical coaching behaviors. The overall environment created
by coaches is vitally important:
• Weiss, Bhalla, and Price (2008) suggested that the environment must focus
on giving optimal, attainable challenges for self-improvement if young ath-
letes are to develop the perceived competence and motivation associated
with success. As stated throughout the chapter, coaches need to understand
the relationship of growth, maturation, and development and the ways that
they contribute to success.
• Weiss, Bhalla, and Price (2008) also highlighted the importance of appropri-
ate goal setting (defined as the age-appropriate number and type of goals
and periods) that meets the developmental needs of each athlete.
• Research by Martindale and Mortimer (2011) noted that the coaching
environment for young athletes is key to their retention, enjoyment, and
success in any sport. That environment requires coach behavior based on
mastery-oriented coaching in which the young athlete is working to achieve
quality performance and is not unduly concerned with success.
• Coaching practice must also be supportive and positive. Coach reactions to
mistakes should take a positive turn by noting what the young athlete did
well and encouraging a repeat of that behavior. In this context, Weiss, Bhalla,
and Price (2008) showed that coaches need to support young athletes in
developing their self-esteem and self-efficacy, in particular, by giving posi-
tive and specific feedback that does not focus solely on correcting errors.
Unsurprisingly, factors similar to those considered when creating a good
environment for athletes should also be taken into account when thinking about
the coach. Cassidy, Jones, and Potrac (2004) suggest that coaches who continu-
ally question their own knowledge and competence are more likely to deliver
positive messages to young athletes and to create the positive environment that
contributes to success. Research also indicates that the role and influence of the
peer group on young athletes is more or less important at different stages of
development (Bruner, Eys, and Turnnidge 2013).

--- Page 380 Text ---
|
Growth and Development 369
As a final note, coaches also need to be aware that the sources of competence
change with, and are related to, age changes in terms of the relative importance
of parents and peer groups and levels of success. Coaches who work with com-
petitive swimmers who are growing and developing through childhood and
puberty need to find ways to develop the swimmers’ confidence and ability to
handle training and competition in line with their maturational age. Under-
standing the implications of growth, maturation, and development will set that
process in motion.
Summary
The topic of growth and development underlies all aspects of sport performance.
Understanding how a young athlete grows and matures is critically important for
coaches as they develop training programs and establish environments that meet
the athletes where they are. Young athletes are not simply miniature adults; they
have different physical and physiological capacities, their mental and emotional
capabilities are not developed to adult levels, and they experience growth spurts
that can completely throw off coordination and motor skills. Yet coaches often
attempt to fit young athletes into an adultlike competition and training model,
potentially compromising performance while providing a less-than-enjoyable
experience for the athletes.
On paper, it is easy to understand that athletes of dissimilar ages are in fact
different from one another and that it makes sense to provide different training
stimuli that match their abilities and skill sets. But when it comes to putting
growth and development principles into practice on the pool deck, things quickly
become more complicated. How do you break athletes into groups to provide
the proper training or social experience? What happens when you do not have
enough lanes to do things exactly right for everyone? How do you handle it when
every athlete in the pool is in need of something slightly different to optimize
his experience in the pool? These issues are a lot to handle and digest, but one
of the most important things that a coach can realize is that differences do exist
and that athlete behaviors and activities might need to be viewed more often
through a growth and development lens. Simply understanding how athletes
grow and develop will help coaches create a developmentally appropriate train-
ing environment and interpret what they see in athletes in and out of the pool.
This chapter has presented a great deal of information on the topics of athlete
growth and development that can improve your coaching. Use it in your pro-
gram to provide swimmers a developmentally appropriate athletic experience
that focuses on the athlete’s long-term development.

CHAPTER
Sports Medicine:
Swimming Injuries
and Prevention
—Courtney Dawson, MD, and Scott A. Rodeo, MD
Musculoskeletal injuries encountered among competitive swimmers tend to
arise from repetitive overuse and improper stroke mechanics. The shoulder
is the area of the body most commonly affected by injury because greater than 90
percent of the propulsive power in swimming comes from the upper extremity.
But the spine, knee, and core (abdominal, trunk, and back) are also frequently
injured in swimmers (Pink and Tibone 2000). Awareness of potential injury
patterns and prevention strategies can help keep swimmers active and in the
water. This chapter provides an overview of common as well as relatively uncom-
mon injuries in swimmers and aims to provide the treating physician or other
medical practitioner with the tools necessary to care for the swimming athlete.
Initial Evaluation
Whether a physician has been working with a swimmer for years or has just met
the athlete, the first step for understanding the nature and extent of the injury
involves an initial evaluation. The approach to the initial evaluation of the swim-
ming athlete who presents with pain should follow several standard principles:
• Take an athlete history. All patients require a careful history to elicit an
understanding of the demands of the sport-specific training regimen. The athlete
history should help the physician gain an understanding of training load because
many of the injuries sustained within this population will be because of repeti-
tive overuse. They may present as a picture of tendonitis, bursitis, impingement,
or muscle imbalance because of fatigue from overtraining.
• Perform a shoulder-specific exam. The shoulder-specific exam should
focus on range of motion, muscle balance and imbalance, scapulothoracic

motion, and laxity. Throughout the course of a season, the competitive swimmer
performs nearly 500,000 strokes with each arm (Richardson, Jobe, and Collins
1980). This workload predisposes the athlete to repetitive overuse injuries of
the upper extremity.
• Evaluate the core of the body. Comprehensive evaluation should always
include trunk strength, core stability, and flexibility (Heinlein and Cosgarea
2010) because deficits in core strength and stability are known to contribute to
injuries further along the kinetic chain (e.g., shoulder).
• Understand and evaluate the stroke mechanics. Although not every physi-
cian will have in-depth knowledge of swimming technique, watching video of
the swimmer with the athlete and coach will help give an understanding of the
underlying injury mechanisms.
Shoulder Injuries
The most common musculoskeletal complaint in swimmers is shoulder pain.
The repetitive overhead motion of the swimming stroke predisposes the shoulder
to overuse injury and pain. Several underlying anatomic factors can increase
the risk of the development of shoulder pain. Shoulder motion, strength, and
stability all depend on the function of numerous muscles around the shoul-
der girdle, including the rotator cuff and muscles around the upper back and
scapula (shoulder blade). Several factors should be considered in the evaluation
of shoulder pain in the swimmer.
Overuse Injuries of the Shoulder
Muscle fatigue and dysfunction that arise because of the demands of swim-
ming stroke mechanics can lead to overuse injuries, specifically of the shoul-
der girdle. Among elite-level athletes, the literature reports the prevalence of
shoulder pain to be as high as 80 percent (Brushoj et al. 2007). During both
freestyle and butterfly stokes, the pectoralis major, latissimus dorsi, and serratus
anterior muscles are responsible for the pull-through, or propulsive phase of
the stroke (Heinlein and Cosgarea 2010). The subscapularis and teres minor
muscles are also active throughout most of the pull-through phase and thus
are prone to fatigue (Pink and Tibone 2000; Heinlein and Cosgarea 2010). As
these muscle units fatigue, they become more susceptible to injury and shoulder
kinematics can be adversely affected. The rotator cuff consists of four muscles
(supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor) and provides
stability to the shoulder girdle. Because of the demands placed on the gleno-
humeral joint during the swimming stroke, the rotator cuff plays a major role
in stabilizing the humeral head in the glenoid (shoulder socket) and avoiding
impingement of the rotator cuff tendons. When fatigued, the rotator cuff com-
plex is unable to function normally and the athlete may alter stroke mechanics
because of pain.

Sports Medicine: Swimming Injuries and Prevention 373
The condition known as swimmer’s shoulder was first described by Kennedy
and Hawkins as a “common painful syndrome of repeated shoulder impinge-
ment in swimmers” (Kennedy and Hawkins 1974; Sein et al. 2010). The com-
plaint expressed by swimmers is often one of vague pain around the front of the
shoulder that may be difficult to define specifically, making diagnosis challeng-
ing. But the treatment algorithm remains the same, centered on an extensive
course of conservative therapy that focuses on strengthening the rotator cuff
and periscapular muscles in addition to addressing improper stroke mechanics.
Shoulder Laxity
Shoulder function depends on a delicate balance of mobility and stability. Sta-
bility of the shoulder joint should provide a balance for proper joint mechan-
ics, but in the case of competitive swimmers, an element of laxity may prove
beneficial for improved stroke mechanics. Shoulder stability is provided by the
capsule (static stabilizers) and rotator cuff musculature (dynamic stabilizers),
which act in combination to provide shoulder stability during overhead activity.
An imbalance because of excessive shoulder joint laxity can lead to rotator cuff
overload, fatigue, and subsequent injury. Many studies have documented the
presence of underlying shoulder laxity among both competitive and recreational
swimmers (Brushoj et al. 2007; McMaster, Roberts, and Stoddard 1998; Zemek
and Magee 1996; Bak and Fauno 1997).
There is a fine line between normal shoulder laxity and abnormal or pathologic
shoulder instability. Many swimmers and other overhead athletes may have ele-
ments of both inherent and acquired laxity because of the demands of training,
and after a threshold is reached, instability may prevail, predisposing the athlete
to injury (McMaster, Roberts, and Stoddard 1998; Zemek and Magee 1996; Bak
and Fauno 1997). The pattern of instability might be either anteroinferior (in
which the humeral head moves excessively forward) or multidirectional. The
condition must be assessed on an individual basis. The most challenging aspect
for the treating physician is differentiating between normal laxity and abnormal
instability in this population.
Impingement
Swimmers, like other overhead athletes, can present with typical symptoms of
impingement of the rotator cuff tendons because of altered stroke mechanics
(Rodeo 2004). Impingement on the top surface of the rotator cuff tendons by the
overlying acromial bone can occur with forward flexion and internal rotation
in the recovery phase of the stroke. Impingement can also occur between the
biceps tendon or deep surface of the rotator cuff and the glenoid and labrum
with the arm in forward flexion, adduction, and internal rotation during hand
entry in freestyle and butterfly.
Less commonly, impingement can occur in swimmers between the coracoid
bone in the front of the shoulder and the subscapularis tendon. The provocative

position is usually forward flexion, adduction, and internal rotation where the
coracoid process may impinge on the underlying subscapularis tendon and lesser
tuberosity of the humerus. Each of these specific types of impingement can be
exacerbated by excessive joint laxity and altered stroke mechanics because of
overload and muscle fatigue.
Jobe, Kvitne, and Giangarra (1989) hypothesized that repetitive overhead
activity can lead to chronic microtraumatic injury to the shoulder capsule and
subsequent laxity. This condition may cause stretching of the capsular struc-
tures and subsequent mechanical impingement (Sein et al. 2010). Although
the evidence in the literature to support this hypothesis is incomplete, the pos-
sibility brings to light the integral relationship between repetitive activity and
subsequent injury.
Os Acromiale Stress Reaction
A much less commonly reported cause of shoulder pain in the competitive
swimmer is a stress fracture in the acromion (“os acromiale”). Bedi and Rodeo
(2009) reported on a case of a collegiate swimmer who presented with insidious
onset of shoulder pain in the nondominant arm without a history of instabil-
ity or trauma. Her initial diagnosis was “swimmer’s shoulder,” and symptoms
recurred immediately after she returned to competitive swimming after a course
of physical therapy and rest. Her exam was consistent with impingement and
showed no evidence of instability. Further workup including cross-sectional
MRI imaging revealed an os acromiale with inflammation at the site of the stress
fracture. Given the failure of conservative treatment and her desire to return to
competitive swimming, the swimmer elected to undergo surgical stabilization.
She was able to return to competition five months after surgery with complete
resolution of her symptoms. Despite this relatively rare case of shoulder pain,
it must be considered in the workup and diagnosis of a swimmer who presents
with shoulder pain.
Spine Injuries
Low-back pain is another common complaint among swimmers. The muscles
of the trunk and lower back are continuously active to maintain posture in
the water during swimming. Similar to the muscles of the shoulder, the major
muscles around the back and spine play a critical role in providing spinal stabil-
ity. Overuse and fatigue of these muscles can lead to back pain. Back pain can
arise from several sources.
Spondylolysis
Hyperextension forces in strokes such as butterfly and breaststroke can lead
to overuse injuries and pain. Despite the fact that swimming is often a recom-
mended form of exercise for patients with low-back pain, competitive swimmers

--- Page 386 Text ---
|
Sports Medicine: Swimming Injuries and Prevention 375
may present with complaints of pain because of their level of training intensity
and repetition. Often, the specific cause of the low-back pain may not be elu-
cidated. Nyska et al. (2000) reported on four elite adolescent swimmers with
low-back pain who were diagnosed with a stress reaction of the spinal vertebra
(spondylolysis). Three of the patients were butterfly or breaststroke swimmers.
Treatment consisted of activity modification and bracing with complete resolu-
tion of symptoms and return to swimming.
Lumbar Disk Disease
Lumbar intervertebral disk degeneration is another potential cause of low-back
pain in elite swimmers. In a study of the Japanese national swimming team,
25 percent of the elite swimmers had symptoms associated with low-back pain
(Katayama et al. 2000). Kaneoka et al. (2007) conducted a case control study
that examined the prevalence of lumbar disk degeneration among elite swim-
mers. They found that 68 percent of the elite swimmers had degenerative disks at
various levels compared with 29 percent of recreational swimming controls. The
prevalence was highest in the lower lumbar spine at the L5–S1 level (Kaneoka
et al. 2007). Risk factors that may predispose to low-back pain in swimmers
include an increase in swimming volume, weight training, stroke mechanics,
and swimming training devices such as fins, kickboards, and pull-buoys that
may lead to excessive hyperextension of the lumbar spine (Nyska et al. 2000).
Knee Injuries
Knee problems are less commonly caused by swimming. Knee pain by itself,
however, is rather common in athletic people, especially young females. Thus,
although the pain may not be caused by swimming per se, knee pain may be
reported by the swimmer.
Pain on the inner (medial) side of the knee can be a common complaint
among competitive swimmers, usually breaststrokers. Kennedy, Hawkins, and
Krissof (1978) reported on a cohort of Canadian swimmers in 1978 and found
that knee pain occurred in 27 percent and that over 70 percent of that subgroup
consisted of breaststroke swimmers (Rodeo 1999). Knee pain, like other injuries
in this population, is most often associated with repetitive overuse. The mechan-
ics of the breaststroke kick place tremendous loads on the knee. Hydrodynamic
forces can add to the cumulative stress and lead to injury. Rovere and Nichols
(1985) reported that knee pain in breaststrokers was related to the number of
years of training and training volume in addition to increasing age and caliber
of swimmers (Rodeo 1999).
The patellofemoral joint (kneecap) is also exposed to abnormal repetitive loads
during swimming training. Pain arising from the patellar area can be due to an
imbalance in muscle strength about the knee or poor stroke and kick mechan-
ics. Increased patellofemoral contact stresses are generated during wall push-off
and repetitive quadriceps muscle contraction with the flutter kick (Rodeo 1999).

--- Page 387 Text ---
}
376 Dawson and Rodeo
Several intrinsic factors must also be considered in the evaluation of a swim-
mer with anterior knee pain such as generalized ligamentous laxity and knee
hyperextension (“genu recurvatum”) (Rodeo 1999).
Less Common Injuries in Swimmers
As discussed earlier, shoulder pain is common in swimmers. Although the most
common cause appears to be rotator cuff muscle fatigue and overload with resul-
tant secondary impingement, other causes should be considered. Sometimes
shoulder pain in swimmers is accompanied by paresthesias (numbness and
tingling) in the hand and fingers. Although shoulder instability can sometimes
be associated with such symptoms, other diagnoses should be considered.
Upper-Extremity Venous Obstruction
Vogel and Jensen (1985) have described a case report of “effort” thrombosis
(blood clot) of the subclavian vein in a competitive butterfly swimmer. This
presentation of shoulder and arm pain in a swimmer is extremely unusual. The
typical incidence seems to be young, physically active male patients. Symptoms
may be subtle at presentation. They are exacerbated by activity and are generally
resolved after a period of rest. Venography is required for confirmatory diagnosis.
Sanders and Rao (2007) presented a case series of six patients with obstruction
of the axillary vein by the pectoralis minor muscle in the front of the shoulder.
All patients presented with symptoms of arm swelling and pain, as well as
weakness, numbness, and tingling in the arm and hand because of decreased
blood flow to the arm. Symptoms resolved after surgical release of the pectoralis
minor muscle. Despite the fact that none of the patients in this case series were
swimmers, the senior author has seen this in a swimmer. The diagnosis of either
axillary or subclavian vein obstruction must be considered in patients present-
ing with neurovascular symptoms, possibly because of repetitive overhead use
of the arms or overuse syndromes.
Rib Stress Fractures/Slipping Rib Syndrome
Rib stress fractures have been described in elite rowers, but Taimela, Kujala, and
Orava (1995) have also presented a case of two consecutive rib stress fractures in
a female competitive swimmer. No trauma preceded either of the fractures, 15
months apart, so stroke biomechanics and her training regimen were believed
to be responsible for the injury. With accurate diagnosis, the rest period for
healing and recovery can be short and the athlete can return to competition in
a timely fashion.
Another uncommon but reported injury pattern in competitive swimming
is the slipping rib syndrome described by Udermann et al. (2005). Slipping rib
syndrome has been described as hypermobility of the anterior ends of the false
rib costal cartilages, which may lead to slipping of the affected rib under the

adjacent superior rib (Gregory, Biswas, and Batt 2002). A case report describes a
20-year-old competitive female swimmer who presented with anterior rib cage
pain during a warm-up. There was no history of trauma. After nine months of
failed conservative treatment, multiple imaging studies and specific physical
exam findings verified the diagnosis. The swimmer successfully returned to
competition after surgical intervention.
Thoracic Outlet Syndrome
Although less common, thoracic outlet syndrome should be considered in the
evaluation and diagnosis of shoulder pain among competitive swimmers. Tho-
racic outlet syndrome refers to compression of the nerves and blood vessels in
the region between the neck and arm. This condition can occur because of a
combination of shoulder laxity and changes in shoulder girdle mechanics and
posture. It presents as pain, numbness, and tingling in the shoulder and arm.
Several studies have described cases of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome in
this population (Richardson 1999; Katirji and Hardy 1995; Fraxino de Almeida
and Meyer 2007). Freestyle, butterfly, and backstroke all involve significant force
for pull-through at the extremes of arm abduction, placing the arm in a precari-
ous overhead position (Richardson 1999). The result may be compression of the
neurovascular structures in the neck and near the first rib. Neurogenic thoracic
outlet syndrome typically affects the nerve roots of the lower cervical spine,
most commonly C8 and T1, because of anatomic positioning. Symptoms of
thoracic outlet syndrome can be either neurogenic, vascular, or less commonly,
both. They may consist of the inability to keep the fingers together during the
pull-through phase of the stroke because of weakness of the intrinsic muscles
in the hand or coolness and pain in the upper extremity.
An association between multidirectional instability of the shoulder and the
development of thoracic outlet syndrome has recently been recognized. Competi-
tive swimmers often possess some degree of shoulder laxity, which may alter the
anatomical relationship between the joint and neurovascular structures of the
neck and arm during the extremes of shoulder motion. The presence of thoracic
outlet syndrome may be missed in patients with multidirectional instability,
so accurate evaluation and diagnosis is crucial when treating this population
(Schenk and Brems 1998).
Sternoclavicular Joint Subluxation
The sternoclavicular joint, where the inner end of the clavicle connects to the
sternum (breastbone), is the primary connection between the shoulder girdle
and the axial skeleton. With the involvement of the shoulder in the biomechan-
ics of the swimming stroke, the sternoclavicular joint may be susceptible to the
same overuse and repetitive use injuries that the glenohumeral joint is prone to
with swimming training. Sternoclavicular joint subluxation (partial dislocation)
is uncommon, but it has been described in the literature among competitive

--- Page 389 Text ---
}
378 Dawson and Rodeo
swimmers. Echlin and Michaelson (2006) present a case report of a 14-year-old
competitive butterfly swimmer with bilateral subluxing sternoclavicular joints
without a history of antecedent trauma. In this case, as in most others present-
ing with atraumatic subluxation, the patient’s exam also revealed generalized
joint hypermobility and laxity.
Exertional Compartment Syndrome of the Forearm
A rare cause of pain and numbness in the hand and arm that has recently been
reported in a swimmer is exertional compartment syndrome of the forearm that
required surgical release (Seiler et al. 2011). Compartment syndrome results from
increased pressure in a muscle group because of incomplete venous outflow from
the muscle during exercise, leading to pain. The patient was a 19-year-old colle-
giate swimmer with forearm pain, tightness, and hand numbness that occurred
during swimming. The diagnosis was verified by elevated muscle compartment
pressures, and the patient returned to competitive swimming after surgical
release of the fascia around the muscle compartment.
Injury Prevention in Swimming
The most important factor in the management of musculoskeletal injuries in
swimming is prevention. A comprehensive program of appropriate stretching,
strengthening, endurance training, development of muscle balance and proprio-
ception, and instruction on stroke-specific mechanics should form the founda-
tion of the training regimen for competitive swimmers. Because overuse injury
is the most prevalent etiology of musculoskeletal pain among this population,
careful monitoring of training volume and duration by coaches and physicians
will help minimize repetitive use injuries and identify athletes at risk. Specific
training regimens should focus on rotator cuff strengthening and scapular
stabilization exercises in addition to a core stabilization program to address
deficiencies in low-back, abdominal, and pelvic muscle strength. Evaluation of
stroke mechanics allows the identification of imbalances and weaknesses that
may predispose a swimmer to overuse injury. Instruction on proper mechanics
will improve performance and help prevent injury.
Summary
Because of the high demands of training, swimmers are prone to repetitive
use injuries. Shoulder pain, an almost universal complaint in this population,
is related to overuse and subsequent fatigue, glenohumeral laxity, and the
mechanics of the swimming stroke. Swimmers can also present with complaints
of low-back pain or knee pain because of the repetitive stress of stroke-specific
mechanics. Proper evaluation will help identify the at-risk athlete and is essential
in accurate diagnosis and management of musculoskeletal injury in the swimmer.

Sports Medicine: Swimming Injuries and Prevention 379
Physicians should also be aware of several less common injuries that have
been reported in competitive swimmers, such as thoracic outlet syndrome,
sternoclavicular joint subluxation, proximal vascular obstruction due to muscle
hypertrophy or cervical ribs, and stress reactions of the acromion and ribs.
Knowledge of these conditions will assist in comprehensive evaluation, work-up,
and management of swimming athletes. Prevention of such injuries is critical
in keeping these athletes in the water and avoiding lost time in training and
competition.

CHAPTER
Sports Medicine:
Illnesses and
General Health
—Margo Mountjoy, MD, CCFP, FCFP, Dip Sport Med
Much attention is given in aquatic sports medicine to the prevention and
treatment of injuries. As any aquatic team physician knows, illness can
also have a negative effect on performance as well as the overall health of the
athlete. Evidence from a surveillance study on injury and illness prevalence
in elite swimmers during a FINA World Championships (2009) supports this
premise (Mountjoy et al. 2010b). Protection and promotion of the health of the
swimmer is an important consideration for maximizing performance in the pool.
Early identification of and effective intervention for medical issues is essential
for the preservation of the well-being of the athlete (Mountjoy et al. 2010a).
Common health issues facing the swimmer include asthma, overtraining syn-
drome, iron deficiency, the female athlete triad, eating disorders, travel-related
health issues, and consequences of pool chemical exposure. The aquatic team
physician needs to be familiar with these conditions, proficient at implementing
prevention policies, and adept at applying effective treatment regimens. Opti-
mizing a swimmer’s overall health and well-being as the swimmer attempts to
achieve fast performances in the pool also requires attention to the proper nutri-
tion and psychological training of the athlete. An effective high-performance
training program must consider all these factors to optimize performance.
Role of the Aquatic Team Physician
The effective aquatic team physician has a multifaceted role in the management
of illness and the promotion of general health of the athlete. This role can be
broken down into three components, as highlighted in figure 19.1: performance
enhancement, prevention of illnesses and injuries, and protection of the athlete.

Performance
The swimmer’s performance in the pool can be enhanced by many factors
including specialized training, expert coaching, and a sophisticated nutritional
program. The swimmer’s performance also will be enhanced by a team physician
who responds efficiently and effectively to health issues, employs evidence-based
return-to-play guidelines, and takes a long-term athlete development perspective
when developing an appropriate performance and illness and injury prevention
program. A team physician can assist by translating the latest sport science and
sports medicine into practical advice for the coach and swimmer. Let’s look at
each of these in more detail.
Effective Illness Intervention
A swimmer with an acute illness can benefit from proficient intervention by a
team physician. The team physician should be readily accessible so that the swim-
mer can access medical care expediently. Medical intervention with appropriate
investigations and effective treatments derived from evidence-based guidelines
will expedite recovery, minimize time lost from the pool, and maximize the
health of the athlete.
Return-to-Play Guidelines
The swimmer who returns to training before recovering fully from an illness or
injury is vulnerable to relapse and recurrence of the original illness. This typically
results in longer absences from training, frustration for the athlete and coach,
interference with performance, and potentially even further health compromise.
The aquatic team physician can minimize this risk to the athlete by ensuring that
evidence-based return-to-play guidelines are followed. A graduated return-to-

--- Page 394 Text ---
|
Sports Medicine: Illnesses and General Health 383
swimming program with a stepwise progression of both endurance and intensity
will help prevent relapse. During this time of recovery and reintegration to full
training, regular medical reviews to evaluate progress facilitates the successful
return to sport. Involving the coach and trainer in the return-to-swimming
planning following illness will help to ensure compliance and increase the
understanding of all the members of the athlete’s high-performance team. Keep
in mind that the specific return-to-swimming guidelines depend on the illness
or injury encountered by the athlete. The best course of action is to consult with
the team physician so that all parties (coaches, parents, athletes, agents, and so
on) are aware of the appropriate course of action.
Long-Term Athlete Development Program
All successful swimmers were once developing child athletes. An aquatic cham-
pion is one who underwent a carefully planned, safe, age-appropriate sport
development program. The child athlete has unique physical, psychological, and
social needs depending on the stage of maturation and development. Training
programs should take into account the structures in the body that are vulnerable
to injury in a developing athlete: articular cartilages, bone structures, growth
plates, and other areas where a disparity is present in the rate of growth between
bone and soft tissues. Scientific guidelines for aerobic, anaerobic, and strength
training of the child athlete should be followed when developing the training
program for the youth swimmer.
The psychological training of the youth swimmer is also an integral com-
ponent of the long-term athlete development model. Similar to the physical
training requirements, the psychological training program varies depending on
the stage of maturity. This training is different from the psychological training
of the mature athlete. In addition, the youth athlete has distinctive hydration
requirements that differ from those of the mature swimmer. Attention must be
directed to those needs to avoid medical issues related to dehydration. In addi-
tion, provisions in the nutritional program of the youth athlete must ensure
adequate intake of energy and the micro- and macronutrients required to meet
the demands of growth, health maintenance, and exercise. Read more about
age-appropriate physical, physiological, and psychological training in chapter
17. The aquatic team physician can play an integral role in helping the coaching
staff design appropriate training programs for the developing child swimmer
(Mountjoy et al. 2008).
Translation of Sport Science Knowledge
Considerable advances continue to be made in aquatic sport science and medi-
cine, advances that have the potential to aid in swimming performance. The
team physician can assist the coach by translating this science into practical
advice to guide the training programs for the elite aquatic athlete both in and
out of the water.

Sports Medicine Team
Take the time to identify a sports medicine team in your area, which can include
a general practitioner, physical therapist, and orthopedist. Identify profession-
als before you need them so that when a need arises you can quickly connect
them to the athlete. When searching for the right team physician, consider
the following:
w Ask around and find someone who has delivered quality care to swimmers
in the past.
w Find someone who is familiar with the demands of elite sport, preferably
someone who has experience with swimming. This person will be better
able to optimize the goals of the athlete, taking into consideration your
goals as a coach and the medical provider’s goals of restoring the athlete
to health.
w Encourage this person to get involved with the team, perhaps by attending
workouts; giving presentations to coaches, athletes, and their parents; or
even traveling with the team to selected events.
Prevention
Besides enhancing performance through the early and effective management of
health issues in the swimmer, the team doctor also has a role in the care of the
elite swimmer to prevent the occurrence of those issues. Prevention principles
implemented by the aquatic team physician will lead to better overall athlete
health, a decrease in illness rate, a decrease in loss of time from training, and
ultimately faster swimming.
Preparticipation Examination
One of the most important opportunities for the sports physician to prevent
illness in athletes is the preparticipation examination (PPE). The PPE should be
mandatory for all elite swimmers. The purpose of the PPE is to identify athletes
whose health may be at risk from sport participation. An example would be the
identification of risk conditions for sudden cardiac death such as arrythmogenic
right ventricular cardiomyopathy, coronary artery abnormalities, or hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy (Corrado et al. 2006). The PPE also identifies athletes who may
have health conditions that affect performance, such as early iron deficiency
anemia, but have not yet shown overt clinical signs. The PPE provides the team
physician the opportunity to ensure that the athlete is receiving appropriate care
for ongoing current medical illness such as asthma. The PPE also helps develop
the athlete–physician relationship. Finally, the PPE enables the physician to
reinforce the antidoping culture of the team.
The PPE should be performed on an individual basis during the off-season so
that appropriate interventions can occur in sufficient time before the competi-

Sports Medicine: Illnesses and General Health 385
tive season. In addition to screening for common injuries seen in swimmers, the
aquatic-specific PPE should assess for the presence of asthma, complications from
prolonged water or chlorine exposure (irritation of the eye such as conjunctivitis
or ear infection), iron deficiency anemia, the female athlete triad (defined later
in the chapter), and eating disorders.
To complement the medical component of the PPE, the examination should
include an assessment of the athlete’s strength, flexibility, body composition,
nutritional status, and psychological health. These assessments will help identify
any current or potential health issues that could affect training and performance.
Periodic examinations throughout the training season offer the opportunity for
monitoring and the early identification of health issues (Ljungqvist et al. 2009).
The PPE should serve to determine whether any risks or underlying health
issues need to be addressed or otherwise known when determining whether an
athlete is healthy enough to engage in a rigorous training program. A PPE should
include information from the following areas:
• Medical history documenting past illnesses, allergies, and injuries
• Family history of illnesses and injuries that could provide evidence of
increased risk in certain areas
• Comprehensive physical exam
• Sign-off from the physician indicating that the athlete is cleared to partici-
pate in sport
Most physicians have their own PPE forms, but a sample form can be found
at www.olympic.org/Documents/Commissions_PDFfiles/Medical_commission/
Athlete_PHE_form.pdf.
Prevention Programs
An effective aquatic team physician not only reacts to health issues as they arise
but also implements prevention programs to prevent health issues before they
occur. To complement the prevention programs for injuries discussed elsewhere
in this book, the team physician should implement prevention programs for
illnesses specific to athletes’ ages, athletic level, and gender. In particular, the
team doctor, working in conjunction with other sport science professionals such
as a sport nutritionist and sport psychologist can implement appropriate nutri-
tional and body image programs for adolescent female athletes to help prevent
the development of the female athlete triad or eating disorders (International
Olympic Committee 2005; Mountjoy 2008; Nattiv et al. 2007). A balanced
nutritional program also helps prevent the development of iron deficiency
anemia and deficiencies in other micronutrients such as calcium and vitamin
D (Peeling et al. 2008).
During the influenza season and when the team is traveling, the team physician
should implement a preventative hygiene educational program for swimmers to
decrease the transmission of influenzas or gastroenteritis on the team (Spence et
al. 2007). Finally, some athletes on the team may benefit from the implementation

of a stress-management program in cooperation with the team sport psycholo-
gist to help them cope with the pressures of high-level training and competition.
Prevention Research
An important aspect of improving the performance of aquatic athletes is the
application of scientifically valid prevention intervention programs. To deter-
mine effective prevention interventions, first ascertain the prevalence of the
health issue and the causative factors (van Mechelen, Hlobil, and Kemper 1992).
Although little illness surveillance data has been published about aquatic ath-
letes, one study completed at the 2009 FINA World Championships (Aquatics)
showed that more illnesses than injuries occurred in elite swimmers during
the course of the championships (Mountjoy et al. 2010b). Swimmers suffered
more illnesses in comparison with the other aquatic disciplines of diving, water
polo, synchronized swimming, and open-water swimming. Analysis of the
injury surveillance data guides the development of prevention programs that
can potentially decrease illness in the future. The aquatic team physician can
become involved by participating in or conducting prevention research projects
and by applying the results of published scientific data on illness prevention in
his aquatic sports medicine practice. According to van Mechelen et al. (1992), the
first step to preventing injuries is to conduct surveillance studies to determine
the prevalence and cause of the injury (figure 19.2).

Protection
The third component of the role of the aquatic sports physician is one of protec-
tion. An important but less commonly recognized role for the team physician is
to educate and protect athletes from other threats to their health. This includes
educating athletes about the risks of performance-enhancing substances and
about recognizing and avoiding sexual abuse.
Antidoping
The team physician is responsible for protecting not only the health of the athlete
but also the integrity of the sport. These goals can be accomplished by observing
and promoting the principles of antidoping in sport as outlined in the World

--- Page 398 Text ---
|
Sports Medicine: Illnesses and General Health 387
Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Code (World Anti-Doping Agency 2015). Using
prohibited substances and methods is harmful not only to the health of the ath-
lete but also to the integrity of sport. The team physician plays an integral role in
protecting the athlete from doping by creating a culture of fair play in which the
practice of doping is unacceptable. As part of this, the team physician must be
intimately aware of the rules and regulations regarding illegal and performance-
enhancing medications as well as the appropriate documentation and reporting
of the use of performance-enhancing medication deemed medically necessary.
Evidence from public health antismoking campaigns teaches us that a cultural
attitude shift to one of nonacceptance of unhealthy or unacceptable behaviors
is an effective deterrent against the unhealthy behavior.
The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) changes the Prohibited List of Sub-
stances and Methods yearly. In addition, the testing protocols and the rules and
regulations for granting permission to use prohibited substances and methods,
known as Therapeutic Use Exemptions, also change regularly. The team physi-
cian should be aware of these changes and should educate swimmers as new
modifications are published to encourage deterrence and to protect the athlete
from inadvertent doping.
Sexual Harassment and Abuse
The aquatic team physician also can help protect swimmers from sexual harass-
ment and abuse. Besides being aware of the signs and symptoms of sexual abuse,
the team physician should have an appropriate intervention strategy should an
incident arise and ensure that the team has preventative policies and codes of
conduct in place, including standards of behavior for members of the athlete’s
entourage and support team.
Sexual harassment and abuse in sport occur in all sports and at all levels,
although prevalence studies show that they occur more frequently in elite sport
(International Olympic Committee 2008). Aquatic sports are not immune to
this issue (Brackenridge 2008). Perpetrators more often are male than female
and are always in a position of power and authority, usually as a member of
the athlete’s entourage or as a senior teammate. Sexual abuse in sport occurs
when athlete protection is absent, perpetrator motivation is high, and athletes
are highly vulnerable. Sexual abuse not only negatively affects the physical and
psychological health of the athlete but also leads to impaired performance,
athlete dropout, and an unhealthy sporting environment for other athletes
(International Olympic Committee 2008).
Fundamental Ethical Principles of Medical Care
The final component of the aquatic team physician’s role in protecting the general
health of the athlete relates to the actual level of the physician’s ethical standard
of medical care. All actions of the aquatic team physician should be guided by
the fundamental principles outlined in the FINA Sports Medicine Rules, which
can be found at www.fina.org/H2O/docs/rules/FINAmedicalrules_20132017.

pdf. These rules are based on the Olympic Movement Medical Code (OMMC),
which can be found at www.olympic.org/PageFiles/61597/Olympic_Movement_
Medical_Code_eng.pdf. The OMMC serves as an ethical guideline for the protec-
tion of the health of the elite athlete. The OMMC reviews the intricacies of the
unique relationship between athletes and their health care providers. The athlete’s
rights to informed consent, confidentiality, and freedom of choice in medical
care are emphasized. The team physician’s obligation to practice evidence-based
ethical medicine, treat athletes with dignity, and alleviate unnecessary suffering
is highlighted. The OMMC reviews the unique principles for the protection and
promotion of the athlete’s health during training and competition. Adhering
to these ethical guidelines serves to ensure that the athlete receives appropriate
and effective care, which will result in protecting the health of the athlete and
subsequently in promoting better performance in the pool.
Swimming-Specific Health Issues
The illnesses and injuries common to swimmers are considered in detail in
this section. Specific interventions or prevention strategies can be employed to
promote health and enhance performance.
Asthma
During the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, swimming had the third highest
incidence of asthma in comparison with all summer sports. The incidence of
asthma was 19.1 percent in swimming, coming in behind triathlon at 25.7
percent and synchronized swimming at 21.2 percent. In contrast, the overall
incidence of asthma at the Olympic Games was 7.2 percent. The high incidence
of asthma in swimming can be attributed to the chronic exposure of the lungs
to environmental irritants while breathing deeply and rapidly during endurance
training. In addition, the exposure of the lungs to chloramines, a by-product of
the chemicals used in pool water, has been implicated as a causative factor for
the development of asthma in swimming (Fitch et al. 2008). Evidence shows
that on retirement from competitive swimming, the asthmatic swimmer can
achieve partial reversibility of the airway obstruction (Helenius et al. 2002).
The swimmer with asthma may present with bronchospasm, chronic cough, or
chest tightness with performance. The athlete may reveal a history of childhood
atopy or allergy. Although the physical examination is often normal, there may
be evidence of bronchospasm. Radiographic evaluation is often normal. Spirom-
etry (FEV1) measured both before and after bronchodilator challenge may show
reversibility of airway obstruction. In the absence of airway obstruction, bron-
chial provocation tests may be conducted to identify airway hyperresponsiveness.
Substances used in the bronchial provocation tests may include methacholine,
mannitol, hyperosmolar saline, and histamine. Eucapnic voluntary hyperpnea
and a controlled exercise challenge may also be used to induce bronchospasm
to facilitate the diagnosis of asthma (Helenius et al. 2002).

--- Page 400 Text ---

Sports Medicine: Illnesses and General Health 389
Pulmonary Function Testing (PFT)
A large percentage of swimmers experience exercise-induced asthma or
bronchospasm because of the harsh effects of swimming in a chlorine-rich
environment. As such, these athletes could likely benefit from using asthma
medications. Many of these medications, however, are banned by U.S. and
international antidoping agencies as performance-enhancing drugs. Even so,
athletes can take these medications if they truly have asthma. To document this,
an athlete can undergo a pulmonary function test (PFT) that measures lung
volume before and after exercise and documents any arising airway restric-
tions. The athlete must then file a Therapeutic Use Exemption (TUE) form,
signed by the testing physician, with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA)
to request use of these medications. Information on TUEs can be found on
the USADA website at www.usada.org/substances/tue/.
The treatment of asthma in the swimmer is based on the same treatment prin-
ciples used for the nonathlete. Attention should be given to decreasing envi-
ronmental allergens, improving education, and treating comorbidities such as
gastroesophageal reflux disorder. Exercise in environments with poor air quality
or extreme heat or cold should be avoided. Because of the chronicity of asthma
and its varying course over time, pharmacotherapy should be individualized for
each athlete. Reassessment at regular intervals is recommended. The cornerstone
of pharmacotherapy is the regular use of inhaled glucocorticosteroids and the
use of fast-acting beta-2 agonists for treatment of breakthrough symptoms. Fast-
acting beta-2 agonists are also indicated for pretreatment for the prevention of
exercise-induced bronchospasm. Leukotriene antagonists and long-acting beta-2
agonists may be useful adjuncts in more severe cases. The swimmer who is well
controlled should have an absence or minimum of day and night symptoms and
no limitation on exercise. Athletes who are not well controlled may have been
misdiagnosed, may be receiving incorrect treatment, may not be complying with
the treatment plan, or may have uncontrolled exposure to exacerbating factors
(Fitch et al. 2008).
The aquatic team physician should be aware of the latest WADA requirements for
Therapeutic Use Exemptions for asthma medications because both beta-2 agonists
and glucocorticosteroids are on the WADA Prohibited List (World Anti-Doping
Agency 2013). These requirements change regularly, so the health care provider
needs to stay abreast of these changes by regularly accessing the USADA and WADA
websites. Large-scale changes to the antidoping code typically are voted on late in
the calendar year and then take effect on January 1 of the following year.
Female Athlete Triad
The female athlete triad refers to “the interrelationships among energy availability,
menstrual function, and bone mineral density, which may have clinical manifestations

390 Mountjoy
including eating disorders, functional hypothalamic amenorrhea, and osteo-
porosis” (Nattiv et al. 2007). Energy availability is defined as the dietary energy
intake minus exercise energy expenditure. The female swimmer runs into difficulty
when the energy expenditure exceeds the energy intake through a clinical eating
disorder, disordered eating, or excessive exercise. In response to the energy deficit,
the hypothalamus suppresses hormonal function, which results in a variety of
menstrual disturbances ranging on a continuum from eumenorrhea to amenor-
rhea. Subsequently, bone health is affected, ranging from suboptimal bone density
to osteoporosis (figure 19.3). Stress fractures are more likely to occur in the athlete
with a menstrual disturbance or with low bone mineral density (Bennell et al.
1999; Torstveit and Sundgot-Borgen 2005).
Because swimming is an endurance sport and a sport in which the athletes’
bodies are on display, body image issues may make female swimmers vulnerable to
the development of the female athlete triad (Sundgot-Borgen and Torstveit 2004).
The treatment of the female athlete triad requires a team approach that
includes the team physician, a sport nutritionist, and a sport psychologist.
Restoration of menstrual function through the correction of energy balance is
essential in the treatment of menstrual disturbances and decreased bone density.

This goal is accomplished by increasing nutritional intake or decreasing energy
expenditures (Drinkwater et al. 1986). Athletes with disordered eating or clini-
cal eating disorders require more specific treatment interventions. Nutritional
counseling should ensure the availability of macro- and micronutrients (cal-
cium, vitamin D, and vitamin K) required for the restoration of bone health.
Athletes have higher protein needs than nonathletes (Nattiv et al. 2007). Early
intervention has been shown to be effective in preventing the development of
more serious symptoms (Kohrt et al. 2004).
Eating Disorders and Disordered Eating
Disordered eating is defined as various abnormal eating behaviors, including
restrictive eating, fasting, frequent skipping of meals, overeating, binge eating fol-
lowed by purging (vomiting), and using diet pills, laxatives, diuretics, or enemas
(Nattiv et al. 2007). An eating disorder is a clinical mental disorder defined by
criteria outlined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-V (DSM-V TR) and needs to
be addressed by a team of qualified and experienced professionals including the
team physician, a sports nutritionist, a sport psychologist or psychiatrist, and
the coach (Sanborn et al. 2000). Eating disorders are characterized by abnormal
eating patterns that often are focused on altered body image, irrational fear of
weight gain, and attempts at weight loss (Nattiv et al. 2007). There are three
classifications of eating disorders (American Psychiatric Association 2000):
1. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by restrictive eating behaviors and
low body weight.
2. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is characterized by overeating followed by purging.
3. Eating disorders not otherwise specified is used for athletes who do not
fully meet the criteria for AN or BN.
The prevalence of eating disorders in sport is greater in female athletes than
in male athletes, and it is higher in sport (15 to 31 percent) than in the general
population (5 to 13 percent). Again, because swimming is an endurance sport
in which body image is important, swimmers are at particular risk for the devel-
opment of eating disorders (Sundgot-Borgen and Torstveit 2004). Abnormal
eating behaviors can potentially be identified in the swimmer by a trained pro-
fessional during the PPE (Ljungqvist et al. 2009). The physical examination of
the swimmer identified by history as being at risk for an eating disorder should
be focused on looking for secondary signs of eating disorders, which often are
absent in the early stages of the illness (Rumall and Lebrun 2004). Laboratory
evaluation should include a complete blood count (CBC), a chemistry profile,
and a hormone profile. A 12-lead ECG will help identify athletes at risk for a
potential lethal cardiac arrhythmia such as bradycardia or ECG changes induced
by electrolyte disturbance. Bone mineral density should be considered for the
amenorrheic athlete to assess bone health, and a nutritional analysis is helpful
to ascertain the status of macro- and micronutrients (Ljungqvist et al. 2009).

A number of self-reporting tools can be used to identify eating disorders in
athletes, including the Eating Disorder Inventory (EDI) (Garner 2004), Eating
Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q) (Carter, Steward, and Fairburn
2001), Eating Disorder Screen for Primary Care (ESP) (Cotton, Ball, and Rob-
inson 2003), and the SCOFF Questionnaire (Luck et al. 2002). The accuracy of
any screening can be further enhanced by including a clinical interview session
following the self-reporting questionnaire (Beals 2003). Swimming coaches
should not administer these tools as part of their coaching. But coaches should
be aware of the warning signs accompanying eating disorders and disordered
eating (figure 19.4) so that they can involve a professional should a need arise
in this area.
The first clinical decision should be to ascertain the risk of life-threatening
conditions associated with eating disorders, conditions that may require emer-
gency hospitalization and would preclude a return to swimming, such as cardiac
arrhythmias, electrolyte disturbances, suicide risk, hypotension, or significant
weight loss (Yager 2007). The treatment plan for the swimmer with an eating
disorder should include psychotherapy and nutritional counselling. Pharmaco-
therapy may be used as an adjunct to psychotherapy for the treatment of eating
disorders and should be used to treat an athlete with any comorbid psychiatric
illness such as depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or suicidal
ideation (Yager 2007). Including the swimmer who is unable to train in team
functions and meetings is beneficial in facilitating the integration of the swimmer
back to sport (Thompson and Sherman 2010). Recognize that although most
people think of females as the only athletes who suffer from eating disorders
and body image issues, male athletes encounter these challenges as well.

Overtraining
Improvements in swimming speed result from the body’s adaptation to train-
ing and competition stress. Not allowing adequate time for the body to recover
from these stressors results in overtraining. In addition to these physical stresses,
psychological factors play a role in the development of overtraining. Although a
full discussion of overtraining and the symptoms associated with it is presented
in chapter 13, some of the key points are restated here:
• The swimmer may complain of excessive fatigue, insomnia, anorexia, myal-
gias, mood changes, and persistent or recurrent minor illnesses.
• A thorough history and physical examination is required to rule out other
causes for the symptoms.
• A comprehensive psychological screening will help identify psychological
stressors both inside and outside sport that may be contributing to the ath-
lete’s stress. Although there is no specific or sensitive laboratory test to iden-
tify the presence of or predict recovery from overtraining, minor elevation
of muscle enzymes and ECG changes may be evident on initial screening.
• The basis of therapy (and prevention of overtraining in the first place) should
be ensuring that the athlete gets adequate rest and recovery from training.
• Regular assessments to monitor recovery and to support the athlete are
recommended. Counseling to assist with extraneous psychological stress-
ors may be indicated. The period of rest required for full recovery is often
prolonged.
• The team physician needs to educate the athlete and the coach about the
warning signs and provide support (Meeusen et al. 2013).
Iron Deficiency Anemia
Iron deficiency anemia is a common illness in female athletes. The cause of iron
deficiency in female athletes is thought to be multifactorial including insufficient
dietary intake, menstrual losses, hemolysis, gastrointestinal losses, sweating,
and hematuria (Fallon 2004). Research by Peeling et al. (2008) suggests that the
acute phase response to exercise results in a release of cytokines that stimulate
the production of hepcidin, a peptide produced in the liver that is a key regula-
tor of iron metabolism. Hepcidin has a negative effect on erythopoesis in the
liver. More research is needed to define this physiological response to exercise.
Regular screening of the female athlete to track the parameters of hemoglobin,
hematocrit, and serum iron and ferritin will help identify the athlete at risk for
iron deficiency early, thus preventing significant morbidity and performance
deficits. Nutritional counseling for female athletes should emphasize the impor-
tance of adequate iron intake to prevent iron deficiency.
Treatment of iron deficiency anemia includes the restoration of iron deficits
and interventions to correct the causative factor to prevent a recurrence. These

--- Page 405 Text ---
}
394 Mountjoy
actions should be instituted under the direction of a physician. If rapid restora-
tion of iron deficits is required because of the severity of the iron deficits or the
timing of critical competitive events, consideration should be given to parenteral
forms of iron replacement such as intravenous iron infusions or intramuscular
injections. These routes may also be used if the athlete is intolerant of oral iron.
If excessive, menstrual losses should be treated by a gynecologist to minimize
the iron deficit. Close monitoring of blood parameters in the female athlete at
risk is recommended.
Eye, Ear, Nose, and Throat (EENT)
The main cause of illness of the eye, ear, nose, and throat (EENT) system is
chronic exposure to water during training. Otitis externa (“swimmer’s ear”) is
caused by the overgrowth of bacteria in the ear canal from the trapping of water.
The swimmer with otitis externa often complains of pain and itching in the ear
canals, which can be quite severe. Using earplugs during training and instilling
acetic acid drops after training are helpful in preventing this condition.
Chlorine-induced conjunctivitis is now rare because of the widespread use
of goggles. Athletes who train in outdoor pools are at risk for the development
of ptergyium in the eye from exposure to ultraviolet light, wind, and sand. A
ptergyium is a benign growth of tissue that extends from the corner of the eye
to the pupil. Because vision may be affected, surgical removal may be necessary
(Meeusen et al. 2013).
Aquatic Dermatological Complications
Prolonged exposure of the skin to water can leave the skin prone to various
infections. Tinea pedis (athlete’s foot) and tinea cruris (jock itch) are caused
by a fungal skin infection. Infections can be prevented by the practice of judi-
cious drying after training and applying antifungal powders. Prerace shaving
of the skin to improve speed by reducing drag can cause a bacterial folliculitis.
Viral plantar verrucae are common in swimmers from exposure of the feet to
the virus on the pool deck. This can be prevented by the use of deck shoes in
the changing rooms, showers, and pool deck. Some athletes develop an itchy
allergic urticarial rash caused by exposure to pool chemicals or cold water. This
rash can be treated with oral antihistamines (Meeusen et al. 2013).
Travel Health
Besides the medical issues that can occur during training, the swimmer is
vulnerable to medical issues resulting from traveling to competitive events. To
minimize the risk of developing these medical issues, the aquatic team physi-
cian should be proactive in developing preventative initiatives relevant to the
particular health risks of the country or countries of destination. Immuniza-
tion requirements vary around the world and may include tetanus, diphtheria,
polio, hepatitis B and C, yellow fever, typhoid fever, and malaria prophylaxis.

--- Page 406 Text ---
|
Sports Medicine: Illnesses and General Health 395
Prophylactic immunization protocols for the swimmer should occur in sufficient
time to ensure adequate immunity at the time of exposure at the competition
or training destination. The information on the immunizations to receive is too
lengthy to list here, but a team physician should be able to provide a swimmer
and coach with appropriate guidelines for international travel. The coach should
be sure to notify the team physician of any international travel plans well in
advance in case any timing-dependent medications or immunizations must be
administered. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) maintains information on
the immunizations recommended for international travel at www.cdc.gov/travel/.
The aquatic team physician also can be instrumental in educating swimmers
on preventative measures in response to the environmental risks unique to the
country of the event or training camp such as pollution, extremes of temperature,
sun exposure, and altitude variations. Medical advice to minimize jet lag and
facilitate acclimatization also can be provided by the team physician. The team
physician should be proactive in arranging clean drinking water and ensuring
an appropriate, familiar, and safe food supply for the team in the hotel in the
country of destination. Street safety is another travel issue that should be con-
sidered in the preventative health program for the traveling swim team.
Competition Health and Infectious Disease
Swimming faster at the time of competition is what counts! Maximizing swim-
ming performance during competition is an important component of the aquatic
team physician’s role. Studies have been published on the injury risks in swim-
ming during competition from the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games (Junge et al.
2008) and during the 2009 FINA World Championships (Aquatics) (Mountjoy
et al. 2010b). To date, only one study outlines the medical illnesses that occur
during a competition (Mountjoy et al. 2010b). During the 2009 FINA World
Championships (Aquatics), 184 acute illnesses were reported, making up 7.1
percent of all registered athletes during the championships. Thirty (16.3 percent)
of these illnesses were expected to result in a time loss from sport, although
no illness was expected to require more than one week’s absence from sport.
Although an absence of less than a week may seem like a minor illness, it would
be disheartening if this period included the athlete’s major competitive events.
The respiratory system accounted for approximately half of the illnesses (n =
91; 50.3 percent) and the gastrointestinal system accounted for a fifth (n = 36;
19.9 percent). The most frequent diagnoses affected the upper respiratory tract
including otitis or middle ear inflammation (16.8 percent) and tonsillitis (9.8
percent). The most commonly reported symptom was pain, and the cause was
classed as infection (49.2 percent) or environmental (27.6 percent) (Mountjoy
et al. 2010b). A prospective study on upper respiratory tract infections (URIs)
in athletes during training and competition shows that URIs are more common
in elite athletes than in noncompetitive athletes. This higher rate of infection
is thought to be due to the increased susceptibility to infection resulting from
overtraining-induced immunosuppression and from crowding at competition

venues. The data from the 2009 FINA World Championships support this latter
premise because it was found that swimming had the highest illness rates in com-
parison with the other aquatic disciplines of diving, synchronized swimming,
water polo, and open-water swimming. The higher rates were postulated to be
due to the relative larger numbers of swimmers, leading to significant crowding
in the warm-up and rest areas around the swimming competition venue. Ear
infections are thought to be common in swimmers because of exposure of the
ears to water-borne pathogens (Beck 2000). These data illustrate the importance
of application of infection control principles to prevent illness in competing
athletes. The aquatic team physician should instruct the athletes and support
members of the athlete’s entourage on infectious disease prevention practices
(figure 19.5) while traveling.
Nutritional Supplements in Aquatics
The sport nutritional supplement industry is a multimillion dollar business
in Western countries. Sports medicine professionals have focused increasing
attention on the use of nutritional supplements. Athletes take nutritional
supplements for various reasons including the promotion of adaptation to train-
ing, the promotion of recovery, the maintenance of health to reduce training
interruptions because of illness or injury, and the enhancement of competitive
performance.
Although the promotional materials for these products claim performance
and health benefits, the sport science fraternity recognizes that ingestion of
these products can result in harm to health and may trigger a positive doping
control result. Because of the nonregulation of the nutritional supplement
industry, the manufacturer has no legal responsibility to ensure the quality and
purity of the supplement. In several documented cases, elite swimmers who
tested positive for anabolic steroids attributed the presence of the substance
in their urine to their use of nutritional supplements. These cases clearly illus-

trate the risk that athletes take when they consume nutritional supplements.
Swimmers need to be reminded of the strict liability premise established in the
World Anti-Doping Code whereby the athlete is responsible for any substance
found in her biological sample. Ignorance is not an accepted excuse (World
Anti-Doping Agency 2009).
Swimmers are large consumers of nutraceuticals (a food or beverage that
provides health or medical benefits) as evidenced by a study of medication
and nutritional supplement use during the 2003 FINA World Championships
(Aquatics) in Barcelona, Spain. A retrospective analysis of 308 doping control
forms was completed to identify and classify the use of declared medications and
supplements during the three days before the doping control test completed at
the time of competition. The results show that 176 athletes (57 percent) declared
the use of a vitamin preparation, 51 athletes (17 percent) declared the use of
a mineral, 80 athletes (26 percent) declared the use of a supplement, and 34
athletes (11 percent) reported the use of an herbal preparation (Pipe, Corrigan,
and Mountjoy 2005).
Nutritional supplements that may have a performance effect include creatine,
caffeine, bicarbonate, and beta-alanine. Creatine can increase the high-energy
creatine phosphate found in muscles, leading to improvement in single or mul-
tiple sprints. Creatine may also produce gains in muscle strength or mass. No
health risks have been identified with its use other than the potential increased
risk for cramping and dehydration.
In small amounts (about the amount found in one cup of coffee), caffeine
may improve performance in prolonged exercise and may be helpful in events
of shorter duration. Larger amounts of caffeine have not been shown to be more
effective and may result in unwanted side effects.
Bicarbonate is an effective buffering agent against the buildup of lactic acid
in events lasting from 30 seconds to 8 minutes. Gastrointestinal discomfort is
a common side effect from the use of bicarbonate. Likewise, beta-alanine has
been shown to be an effective buffer for use in high-intensity events through
the enhancement of muscle levels of carnosine (International Olympic Com-
mittee 2010).
Swimmers who consume a well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet should not need
to use nutritional supplements. The aquatic team physician has a responsibility
to educate swimmers about the risks of consuming nutritional supplements. In
fact, coaches, athletes, and any health care professionals who work with athletes
need to be aware of the rules and regulations about nutritional supplementa-
tion as well as the risks involved in using these substances, even those that on
the surface are identified as legal.
Proper Nutrition
The swimmer’s diet has a large influence on training and can affect performance.
A discussion of illness and general health in the promotion of swimming faster
would not be complete without attention to nutrition. Although more detailed

--- Page 409 Text ---
}
398 Mountjoy
nutritional information can be found chapter 14, several important highlights
related to the health of the athlete are reviewed here:
• A swimmer’s nutritional prescription should be individualized with respect
to age, maturation, size, energy output, time of competitive season, and
gender.
• Attention should be given to ensuring adequate energy intake to balance
energy output.
• Adequate provision of carbohydrate as a fuel source and for optimizing
glycogen recovery after exercise is essential in the aquatic athlete.
• Sufficient protein intake provides the necessary building blocks for muscle
development and hormone and enzyme production. Protein is also essential
for the repair of damaged tissues.
• Vitamins and minerals including iron, calcium, copper, manganese, mag-
nesium, selenium, sodium, zinc, and vitamins A, C, E, B and B are par-
6 12
ticularly important for athlete health.
• Appropriate hydration preexercise, during exercise, and postexercise for
recovery can positively affect performance.
• For endurance swimming events or practices longer than one hour, hydra-
tion should include carbohydrate as an energy source and electrolytes to
replace salt losses from sweating in addition to the replacement of fluid
losses. Hydration status can be monitored by evaluating body weight pre-
and postexercise. The color of the urine is another indicator of hydration
status; concentrated or dark urine indicates dehydration. Urine color charts
are available online. Keep in mind that these charts are helpful tools but
are not foolproof. Some nutritional supplements will cause a change in
urine color regardless of hydration status; any interpretations made about
hydration should consider this point.
Special nutritional modifications for swimmers training or competing while
fasting during the month of Ramadan should be addressed.
The youth swimmer has unique nutritional demands regarding altered ther-
moregulation and hydration homeostasis relative to the adult athlete. The youth
swimmer must also ingest sufficient energy and nutrients to sustain growth in
addition to meeting exercise demands. The young swimmer is at an impression-
able stage when lifelong healthy nutritional habits and a healthy body image
can be encouraged.
The female swimmer’s nutritional prescription should include balanced energy
intake in addition to adequate iron to replace menstrual losses and calcium to
maximize bone health. Attention to healthy strategies for reducing body fat may
be necessary in some female athletes. Endurance female swimmers should have a
balanced energy intake to reduce the risk of developing the female athlete triad.
An important component of enhancing swimming performance during com-
petition is careful attention to nutrition. During travel, the swimmer should

--- Page 410 Text ---
|
Sports Medicine: Illnesses and General Health 399
maintain good hydration status. Arrangements should be made with the accom-
modating hotel to provide safe and high-quality food and water for the team.
Swimmers can be encouraged to bring familiar snacks from home such as cereal,
breakfast bars, rice cakes, crackers, pretzels, spreads, and nuts and dried fruit.
Swimmers who compete in endurance events (800 meters and longer) should
pay special attention to the nutritional demands of the prolonged duration of
these events. Because carbohydrate is a key source of energy, adequate intake
during the six hours before the swim is advantageous. The swimmer should
ensure adequate water and salt intake preevent, often finishing the last drink
60 to 90 minutes before competing. During long swims, fluid, carbohydrate,
vitamin, mineral, and electrolyte replacement should occur throughout the
event to ensure energy balance and replace losses through excessive sweating.
Because of the short duration of sprint events, fluid and carbohydrate levels
have less influence on performance. But because of the competition structure
that includes heats, semifinals, and finals and long periods between events,
attention should focus on maintaining fluid and energy levels.
Psychological Health
The margin that separates athletes today is so small that a swimmer truly needs
to develop a psychological edge as well as a physical edge over his competitors.
A huge percentage of success can be attributed to psychological skills, because
in the end, the way in which an athlete prepares mentally goes a long way to
determining performance, especially at the elite level in which many athletes
are working with similar levels of physical skill. The elite swimmer has to be
committed and devoted to developing a psychological strategy to achieve the
ultimate goal of success.
Chapter 16 focuses specifically on the development of mental skills to
enhance swimming performance. Attention to the swimmer’s psychological
health is not only a key to physical performance but also a critical component
to maintaining health. As with all people in society, the swimmer may suffer
from psychological illnesses or challenges that require special attention in the
team and competitive venues.
Summary
A successful elite aquatic athlete requires a complex integrated training program
of sport science, psychology, and sports medicine. The aquatic team physi-
cian plays an integral role in enhancing performance, preventing illness, and
protecting the athlete. Swimming faster requires attention to medical issues in
the aquatic athlete. Early diagnosis and institution of effective treatments for
commonly occurring medical illnesses in swimmers will help decrease time lost
from training and competition. Instituting surveillance and prevention programs
will help prevent many of the medical issues that face elite swimmers. The team

doctor plays an integral role in collaborating with and coordinating the inter-
ventions of other members of the high-performance team, including the sport
nutritionist and the sport psychologist. Promoting and protecting the health of
the elite swimmer will ultimately result in faster swimming.

CHAPTER
Strength and Conditioning
for Performance
Enhancement
—Scott Riewald, PhD, CSCS
Most, if not all, of the top swimmers today engage in some sort of strength
training. Not long ago swimmers and coaches debated whether strength
training was beneficial or harmful to swimmers, yet today many would argue
that it is an integral part of a swimmer’s overall preparation strategy.
The term strength training is a somewhat ambiguous term in the world of
swimming, and it is not necessarily synonymous with the term dryland training.
Strength refers to a person’s ability to generate or resist force. At its core, strength
training centers on training against resistance, whether that resistance is found
in the pool or in a weight room. The resistance underlying strength training can
take various forms. One swimmer might use body weight or elastic tubing to
provide the resistance, whereas another might use weight machines or devices in
the pool to increase drag and apply the necessary resistance to promote strength
development. All of these strength-training modalities have a place in swimming.
In fact, most swimming strength-training programs provide a combination of
dryland training (exercises performed out of the water) and in-water training,
and each element is designed to develop a specific aspect of strength.
Besides building strength, swimmers need to develop power, or the ability to
produce large forces quickly. In every race or competition, the ability to gener-
ate power comes into play. Even distance swimmers, long thought to need only
muscular endurance, can benefit by adding exercises designed to improve power
to their training plans.
In theory, increased strength should lead to increased ability to generate
propulsive forces in the water. Although this statement makes logical sense,
we need to recognize that increased dryland strength does not always lead
to increased propulsive force in the water, nor does it necessarily translate to
improved swimming performance. The ability to produce propulsive force in the
401

}
402 Riewald
water is a multifaceted, complex task that incorporates proper timing, technique,
body position, and subtleties of hand and arm position, in addition to strength.
Strength is just one of the myriad variables that contribute to performance in
the pool, yet it is an important variable.
Although research has shown that it is difficult to establish strong correlations
between an athlete’s maximal strength and swimming performance, whether
a swimmer is able to tap into her maximal strength is in many ways irrelevant.
Swimmers can still benefit and improve in-water performance by participating
in a well-structured strength and conditioning program, regardless of whether
they are able to pull or kick harder. Although on the surface this statement may
appear to be confusing or contradictory, consider the following:
• Swimmers can experience strength and flexibility imbalances, but engaging
in a strength and conditioning program can restore that balance, which can help
prevent injuries and reduce the number of lost or poor-quality training days.
Through this mechanism alone, strength training can enhance training and
performance. If nothing else, swimmers should perform foundation-focused
strength training exercises to maintain proper balance throughout the body
and assist in the prevention of common swimming injuries, including swim-
mer’s shoulder.
• Even without increasing propulsive force, better muscle strength and control
can help swimmers maintain better body position in the water, thus reducing
drag and thereby improving performance. Maintaining better control of the
body in the water can have a profound effect on performance. In chapter 1 it
was shown that swimming speed can be increased by reducing resistance, so any
improvement in body position should result in increased swimming velocity.
Maximal strength may not be important in swimming. Instead, swimmers
may need only a necessary level of strength to succeed at the elite level. Among
the myriad factors that affect performance are what could be called correlational
factors, meaning that a strong correlation is present between the variable and
a given performance outcome, such as swimming velocity. The assumption in
this type of a relationship is that more of something is better. Alternatively,
there can be what are best called threshold variables, in which a certain level is
needed to achieve high-level performance. Above that threshold a poor correla-
tion is found between increased gains in that area and performance. Kondraske
(2008) has proposed the idea that a threshold relationship exists between some
basic performance variables and real-world performance outcomes. He has
advocated that attempts to draw strong correlation relationships may not make
sense for every factor that contributes to performance. Instead, he puts forward
the notion that commonalities will appear among all top performers in that
they all achieve at least a baseline level of aptitude in certain critical areas. As
part of the discussion on swimming performance, it is worth considering that
strength may be one of those threshold variables. Although more strength is
not necessarily better, swimmers may need to achieve at least a baseline level
of strength to achieve peak performances at any level.

Strength and Conditioning for Performance Enhancement 403
This chapter shares what the research says about strength in swimming and
how it contributes to swimming performance. In addition, it looks at how the
knowledge about strength training can be put to use in the development of
programs to improve swimming performance and minimize the risk for injury.
Understanding the Demands
of Swimming and the Potential Role
of Strength and Conditioning
Training for swimmers, both in and out of the water, needs to reflect the demands
of the sport and prepare the body appropriately for competition. The importance
of a well-designed strength-training program comes into focus when we reflect
on the physical demands of swimming. Consider the following factors that affect
swim performance:
• Demands of the stroke. Swimming encompasses four different strokes that
use, in some instances, markedly different muscle groups. Stroke-specific
exercises will help build the strength, power, and flexibility needed to excel
in particular events.
• Demands of the race. Within a given stroke, the competitive swimming
events range dramatically in distance, from 50 to 1,500 meters in the pool
and as far as 25 kilometers in open water events. An athlete’s strength-
training program needs to be adapted to the demands of the race.
• Individuality of the athlete. Every athlete is different in body size, shape,
and physiology. Therefore, what works well as a strength program for one
athlete may not be optimal for another. Strength training needs to be
adapted to the individual needs and unique aspects of each swimmer to
maximize performance in the pool.
• Uniqueness of performing in water. Swimming places demands on the
core of the body that are unlike those seen in any land-based sport. Because
swimmers need to generate force and propulsion by pressing against a fluid
surface, they need to be even stronger and more stable through the core than
athletes who compete in land-based sports. Strength training, particularly
exercises done in the water, can help improve an athlete’s feel for the water and
improve the ability to produce propulsive force with the upper and lower body.
• Repetitive nature of the strokes. An elite freestyler may take between 20 and
25 stroke cycles every 50 meters. A swimmer who trains 8,000 meters per
day will take between 3,200 and 4,000 stroke cycles every day. If this same
swimmer trains six days a week, each arm will pull as many as 1,000,000
times over the course of a year. Although any one stroke does not cause an
injury, the repetitive damage that builds up over time with each incorrect
stroke can easily sideline a swimmer. Strength training can help prevent
these overuse injuries from occurring.

--- Page 415 Text ---
}
404 Riewald
• Tendency for imbalances to be formed. The repetitive nature of swim-
ming predisposes athletes to developing strength and flexibility imbalances
(McMaster 1999; Bak 2010; USA Swimming Task Force on Injury Prevention
2002; Rodeo 2004; Spiegelman 2006; Torres and Gomes 2009). Common
imbalances seen in swimmers include but are not limited to the following:
shoulder internal rotator strength greater than shoulder external rota-
tor strength, trunk flexor strength greater than trunk extensor strength,
glenohumeral internal rotation deficiency (GIRD) that limits the internal
rotation that can be achieved in the shoulder, and hip flexor tightness that
induces anterior pelvic tilt and alters body position and kicking efficiency
in the water.
The preceding factors, among others, make swimming unique in the world of
sport. For all those reasons, it becomes apparent that strength training is needed
to prepare the body for training and competition. Note that swimming in and
of itself will build strength, but only to a point. The argument can be made that
the swimmer will never fully develop the strength necessary to achieve maxi-
mal performances simply by participating in the sport. In fact, not engaging
in strength training to complement swimming can be detrimental to health
and performance. The repetitive and unbalanced nature of swimming often
causes the muscles and structures on the anterior side of the body to become
disproportionately stronger than those on the posterior side of the body. These
imbalances contribute to a number of the injuries seen in swimmers (McMaster
1999; Bak 2010; USA Swimming Task Force on Injury Prevention 2002; Rodeo
2004).
Goals of a Strength-Training Program
and the Factors Contributing
to Strength Development
A strength program can be designed to target the development of specific
strength attributes, some of which are better suited to swimming performance
than others (Baechle and Earle 2008). Research and practical experience have
identified various strategies that should be used based on the physical attribute
being targeted. The strength attributes that could be targeted are identified here.
• Maximal strength. Maximal strength refers to the greatest amount of force
that a swimmer could generate in one all-out effort. Maximal strength is com-
monly measured as the amount of weight a person could lift (or force that can
be generated) in a one-repetition max test (1RM). Swimmers typically are not
focused on developing maximal strength in any muscles or muscle groups in
the body.
• Strength endurance. Strength endurance is the ability to produce a specified
level of force repeatedly without fatigue. Typically, the level of force generated in

--- Page 416 Text ---
|
Strength and Conditioning for Performance Enhancement 405
any one contraction is not maximal, but it may represent a high percentage of
a swimmer’s maximum force-generating capacity in specific muscles or muscle
groups. Strength endurance is critically important for swimmers because of
the repetitive nature of the sport; for a swimmer to perform well and remain
free from injury, many muscles need to have strength endurance. Some specific
muscles or muscle groups that come to mind are the scapular stabilizers (which
control the shoulder blades and maintain proper positioning of the shoulder
joints), the core muscles (which control body posture in the water), the muscles
of the rotator cuff and upper back (which are responsible for generating upper-
body propulsion), and the muscles of the hip (which drive the propulsive kick).
Strategies to develop strength endurance should be incorporated into strength-
training plans for these muscle groups.
• Power. As discussed earlier, power is the ability of the neuromuscular
system to produce large forces in a short time. Mathematically, muscle power
equals muscle force multiplied by contraction velocity. Power is an important
aspect of performance in swimming, especially in certain muscle groups where
explosiveness is required to achieve optimal performance. For example, power-
ful lower-limb extensor muscles are needed to drive the start or push-off from
the wall following a turn. Power in the upper-body musculature is beneficial
to sprint performance and to the ability to shift into another gear at the end of
a long race.
• Muscle hypertrophy. Hypertrophy training is designed to maximize muscle
size, not necessarily strength. In general, strength training designed for swim-
mers should not be focused on gaining muscle size.
Strength can also be categorized based on the role that it plays in the execution
of a sport. Strength can be thought of in two common ways as it relates to swim-
ming performance—foundational strength and swimming-specific strength.
Foundational strength may also be thought of as general strength, or the strength
base needed simply to play the sport. The goal of building foundational strength
should not be to develop maximal strength, but instead to build a strength base
on which the swimmer can build power and swimming-specific strength.
Swimming-specific strength describes the strength needed to execute the four
strokes and excel while doing it. Each of the four strokes has specific demands
that require different muscles to be used in different ways. Some coaches refer to
swimming-specific strength as functional strength, but the terms are essentially
synonymous and refer to developing in-water strength specific to maximizing
performance.
Table 20.1 identifies general strategies for developing muscular strength, maxi-
mizing power, increasing muscle size and growth (hypertrophy), and building
strength endurance. These strategies hinge on delivering the right stimuli to
the muscles—the best combination of load (represented as the percentage of an
athlete’s 1RM load), repetitions, sets, rest and recovery between sets, exercise
speed, and the number of training sessions per week to maximize the gains
seen by the athlete.

2nd ed. (Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics).
Depending on the muscle group being strengthened or the event that the
swimmer is training for, a swimmer may adopt a training plan that emphasizes
endurance or speed and power. To develop strength endurance, the swimmer
performs fewer sets but executes more repetitions than the swimmer who is
training to develop power or speed. To develop power and speed, athletes typi-
cally perform more sets using relatively low loads, which promotes production of
higher speeds. Although swimmers may focus on developing strength endurance
at times, they will still integrate workouts that emphasize strength and power
development. The process of structuring training across a season to include
these various elements is called periodization. This topic is the focus of chapter
9. As a rule, swimmers should not have muscle hypertrophy as a strength goal.
These principles should drive how coaches develop strength-training regimens
for the swimmers they work with.
Developing Power in Swimming
The focus of power training should be to find the optimal balance between
strength and speed and then carry that power over to athletic performance.
Sport-specific power development is difficult in any sport, but because swim-
mers need to be able to generate this power against water, an unstable surface,
as opposed to the ground, power training can become even more complicated.
The force that a runner applies to the ground translates into nearly 100 percent
propulsive force, but in swimming some of the force applied to the water puts
the water in motion, resulting in a lower percentage of the force going toward
propulsion. One of the most difficult tasks for a swimmer is learning to apply
force in a manner that maximizes the resultant propulsive action.
The thinking in the past was that power was best developed by lifting heavy
loads for a small number of repetitions. But this way of training does not address
the speed component of the power equation, just the force component. Conse-
quently, recent thinking about building power in athletes has changed somewhat

--- Page 418 Text ---
|
Strength and Conditioning for Performance Enhancement 407
to incorporate several new paradigms. Now, strength and conditioning programs
designed to maximize a swimmer’s power should contain three components:
1. Some strength training using heavy resistance
2. Plyometric exercises that work on developing the rate of force development,
or the speed at which the muscles can contract and produce force
3. Speed-based strengthening that uses lower resistance but emphasizes per-
forming the exercises as quickly as possible and through the greatest range
of motion possible
Swimmers often need to develop endurance and power simultaneously to
maximize performance. This effort creates a problem, because large amounts
of endurance training can inhibit muscle strength and power (Sharp, Troup,
and Costill 1982; Costill 1999; Sharp 1986) and vice versa. Training must be
periodized so that speed and power training is integrated appropriately with
endurance training to optimize muscle function for swimming.
Relationship Between Strength
and Swimming Performance
Before going much further into a discussion of how to design a swimming-spe-
cific strength-training program, let’s look at what the research has to say about
the effect that improvements in swimming strength have on performance. To
ground this discussion, we can restate the goals of a strength-training program
in swimming: to enhance performance and reduce the risk of injury. Note the
following points about the nature of the existing research and the way in which
it should be interpreted:
• Compared with the other areas of sport science and sports medicine that
have been studied in relation to swimming, the body of research about
strength and swimming performance is limited. A body of work from the
1980s exists, but little systematic research has been conducted since.
• The proficiency of the swimmers studied in the existing literature encompasses
the full spectrum of ability, from developmental to elite athlete, making com-
parisons and the ability to draw definitive conclusions difficult. As might
be expected, the research shows the greatest correlation between strength
and performance when looking at groups of athletes that include a wide
range of proficiency in the water. As the groups become more homogenized
with respect to swimming proficiency, the correlations between strength
and swimming performance decrease (Sharp, Troup, and Costill 1982).
• Given the complexities of the swimming stroke and the way that propul-
sion is generated, teasing out the exact contribution that strength gains
make to performance is difficult. This issue pertains as well to the analysis
of other performance factors, but note that in addition to strength gains

--- Page 419 Text ---
}
408 Riewald
that may occur from training, other factors are changing that can affect the
observed results.
As a result of these factors, the results coming from the literature are that no
definitive statement can be made that strength training definitely has “this effect”
or “that effect” on performance (Tanaka and Swensen 1998). But the evidence is
sufficient to suggest that improved strength and power can affect performance
in the pool. This idea is especially true if we consider the point made in the
introduction to this chapter that strength may be a threshold variable; in this
light, strength training is not about making swimmers as strong as they can be;
rather, it is about getting them to a threshold level of strength that any swimmer
needs to succeed (Kondraske 2008).
With that stated, let’s look at the research to understand whether strength
training contributes to these areas. Rather than run through pages of text, the
approach taken here is to summarize key findings from research and identify
the take-home message for coaches.
When looking at the correlation between dryland (out-of-water) strength tests
and in-water performance, studies have not shown many conclusive results. But
the research has shown a relationship between peak isokinetic shoulder torque
(Miyashita and Kanehisa 1983) and swimming time in the 100 meter FR as
well as between arm power measured on a swim bench and performance in a
25-meter sprint (Sharp, Troup, and Costill 1982). Vorontsov (2011) found that
dryland strength measures of maximum pulling force and power, as measured
on a swim bench, were the only variables to correlate with in-water perfor-
mance in a selected group of female swimmers, and even then, these variables
correlated only to performance in sprints (50-meter and 100-meter swims), not
in longer distance performances. In more recent studies, Girold and colleagues
(2007) have found that swimmers experience significant increases in strength as
well as swimming velocity following a 12-week dryland strengthening program
focused on developing strength in the upper body, primarily, as well as the core
and legs. Garrido et al. (2010) have also shown correlations between various
dryland strength and power measures and sprint performance.
Although the correlations between strength and power and performance
may not show a statistically significantly relationship, studies conducted in the
early 1980s on national-caliber swimmers found that sprinters generated the
highest levels of upper-body power, as measured on a swim bench, compared
with middle-distance swimmers (next highest group) and endurance swimmers
(Sharp, Costill, and King 1983). Additionally, the male swimmers produced
more power than the females did in the study. Within these groups, however,
power did not correlate with performance (meaning that the strongest sprinter
did not necessarily swim the fastest times in the pool), lending credence to the
idea that strength and power may be a threshold variable, as suggested earlier
when discussing the research of Kondraske (2008).
The research focused on lower-body strength and the relation to performance
is even more limited. One study showed a correlation between knee extension leg

--- Page 420 Text ---
|
Strength and Conditioning for Performance Enhancement 409
power and swimming velocity in a 200-meter FR (Bardzukas et al. 1992). Given
the broad age range of the swimmers involved, the results likely reflect differ-
ences in age and swimming proficiency rather than differences in leg strength.
Investigations that centered on comparing in-water strength measures with
performance show more-promising results. Several studies have shown that
the peak pulling force, as measured in tethered swimming, correlates with per-
formance across a range of swimming distances (Sharp 1986; Vorontsov 2011;
Sharp, Costill, and King 1983; Girold et al. 2006; Toussaint and Vervoorn 1990).
Girold and colleagues (2006) showed that swimmers achieved faster swimming
velocities following three weeks of either in-water resisted-swimming training
(swimming against elastic resistance) or swimming-assisted training (swim-
ming with the assistance of elastic tubing). But the greater performance gains, as
assessed by a 100-meter FR time trial, were seen in the athletes who participated
in the resisted-swimming group. Toussaint and Vervoorn (1990) also showed
that resisted sprint training for 10 weeks contributed to improved performances
in race distances ranging from 50 to 200 meters.
Considering all this, a strong argument can be made that strength training,
and developing strength on dryland or in the water, can have a positive effect on
swimmers, even when looking only at performance. When considering injury
prevention, the case to be made for integrating strength training with in-water
swimming becomes even stronger, as will be seen later in this chapter.
Dryland Strength-Training Modalities
for Swimmers
Coaches and swimmers have many options when it comes to designing and
implementing a strength-training program that will maximize performance
in the pool while also minimizing the risk of injury. Each strength-training
modality has pros and cons, such as cost, ability to travel with the equipment,
swimming specificity, and so on, and coaches and athletes likely will favor cer-
tain approaches over others. This section presents some of the more common
modalities that can be used as part of a comprehensive strength-training program
along with the pros and cons of each. Note that there not a gold standard when
it comes to strength training. The most successful strength-training programs
integrate aspects from various modalities to provide the best environment for
developing swimming-specific strength.
Elastic Resistance
Strength training against the resistance of elastic tubing has been part of swim-
ming for decades. Elastic tubing is easy to use and portable, and it allows swim-
mers to mimic swimming-like motions as a dryland exercise.
One downside of using elastic tubing, or bands, for strength training is that
the resistance it provides is not constant; the more the tubing is stretched, the

--- Page 421 Text ---
}
410 Riewald
greater the resistance it provides. Typically, the resistance increases as a swimmer
progresses through the full range of motion of an exercise. In some instances
this may be appropriate for developing swimming-specific strength (e.g., force
builds through the execution of a swimming pull), but in others it may not be
(e.g., in many exercises designed for injury prevention).
Elastic resistance also can be used in the pool in tethered swimming, in which
the swimmer must swim against added resistance (Vorontsov 2011; Sharp, Costill,
and King 1983). More information on in-water resistance training is provided
later in this chapter.
Swim Bench Training
Swim benches provide isokinetic or isotonic resistance while allowing swim-
mers to model the in-water stroke. Some swim benches require the athlete to use
body weight as the resistance, whereas others force the swimmer to pull against
an extra load. When doing any of these exercises, swimmers must try to mimic
the stroke that they race with. They should maintain the appropriate stroke rate
and mechanics to engrain the proper neuromuscular patterns.
Suspension System Training
In recent years a number of suspension training systems have come on the
scene. Both recreational and professional athletes use these systems. The basic
premise behind suspension systems is that the athlete is required to control
body position by engaging the core and other stabilizing muscles to perform an
exercise. In short, these strength-training systems provide an additional balance
challenge to athletes as they are performing otherwise traditional exercises.
This type of training stimuli is particularly appropriate for swimmers because
of the need for core and scapular stability to perform optimally in the pool.
Given the relative newness of suspension systems and their integration into
mainstream strength training, few resources are available that specifically target
swimmers, although more education and information targeting swimmers is
now becoming available.
Free Weights and Strength-Training Machines
Almost every weight room provides both free weights and machines as train-
ing options. As with other training modalities, these tools have advantages
and disadvantages. Both are designed to help athletes improve strength, but
free-weight exercises place added premium on stability and control in the joints
involved in the movement because the movement path is not constrained as it is
in many weight machines. But machines are relatively easy to use, are thought
to be a safer alternative to free weights, and allow the user to perform some
exercises that are difficult or impossible to execute using free weights (Baechle
and Earle 2008).

--- Page 422 Text ---

Strength and Conditioning for Performance Enhancement 411
Olympic Lifts
Olympic lifts such as the snatch and the clean and jerk are a class of exercises
used in Olympic weightlifting competitions. These multijoint exercises build
full-body strength and explosive power, but they require a high level of techni-
cal expertise to perform correctly. Several simple modifications (e.g., the hang
clean and high pull) can be made to the Olympic lifts to give swimmers a series
of exercises that they can use to develop further power and explosiveness. These
advanced exercises should be performed in a weight room, not necessarily on the
pool deck. In addition, a certified strength and conditioning specialist should
be enlisted to provide instruction on proper lifting technique.
Stability Training
Stability training involves performing exercises that contain an element of bal-
ance. Such exercises range from those performed while standing or sitting on
an unstable surface (e.g., rowing while seated on an exercise ball or performing
a shoulder external rotation exercise while standing on a balance pad) to distal
movements executed with the arms and legs while maintaining a stable body
position (e.g., side plank with a single-arm row). Because they provide an added
challenge to the body, stability exercises are an advanced form of exercise. For
example, a standing external rotation exercise using elastic tubing with the elbow
at the side becomes increasingly challenging when the shoulder is abducted 90
degrees so that the scapular stabilizers need to become engaged at a higher level.
(See the standing external rotation and catch position external rotation exercises
later in the chapter for comparison between the two techniques.)
In-Water Strength-Training Modalities
for Swimmers
In-water strength training provides swimmers the benefit of developing sport-
specific strength while training actual swimming movements. Arguably, these
types of in-water exercise are most beneficial for improving swimming per-
formance because they provide a progressive overload and a high degree of
transferability between the exercise and the swimming strokes (Tanaka and
Swensen 1998; Girold et al. 2007; Sharp, Costill, and King 1983; Girold et al.
2006; Toussaint and Vervoorn 1990).
Coaches can add resistance in any number of ways to create in-water resistance
sets, yet swimming against resistance should be treated as any other training
exercise (e.g., considering volume, intensity, rest, frequency). Whatever training
method is used, care should be taken to ensure that the exercise does not nega-
tively affect the swimmer’s stroke technique. Nevertheless, swimming against
added resistance will likely change stroke mechanics. Maglischo et al. (1995)
found that swimming against resistance typically causes the swimmer to swim

--- Page 423 Text ---
}
412 Riewald
with decreased stroke rate and decreased stroke length. Treating these exercises
as strength-training exercises and structuring sets in the manner of a free-weight
exercise will produce a strengthening effect. Doing these exercises in large doses,
however, can lead to stroke alterations and bad technique habits.
Swimming Against Added External Resistance
Swimming against extra resistance (e.g., tethered swimming or swimming with
parachutes) allows a swimmer to use proper stroking mechanics while building
strength. The swimmer maintains a feel for the water, and loads can be increased
incrementally to provide progressive overload. Swimmers also may have access
to a power rack, a weight stack that can be tethered to a belt placed around a
swimmer’s waist. As the swimmer swims down the pool, he lifts the weight stack
and swims against a defined level of added resistance.
Vertical Kicking and Using Fins or Paddles
Vertical kicking sets can be used to develop lower-body power by having swim-
mers hold their hands or a small medicine ball above the head. Additionally, fins
can provide additional resistance and progressive overload when kicking. The key
with using fins, or paddles for that matter, is to treat them as strength-training
exercises. Sets can be designed to target specific aspects of strength development
(e.g., power). Athletes should work at the required intensity to reap the benefits
of this type of training.
Assisted Swimming
Swimming with assistance can provide another means for developing swim-
ming speed and sport-specific strength. In short, assisted swimming works on
developing speed and getting the body accustomed to the feel of swimming
fast. Swimming with assistance trains the neuromuscular system for race-paced
performances.
The easiest way to perform assisted swimming is to attach a long piece of
elastic tubing to one end of the pool and the other to the swimmer’s waist. The
swimmer should pull or swim to the other end of the pool, let go, and allow
the band to pull her along as she swims. A partner can assist by pulling in the
slack tubing as the swimmer swims. This overspeed training allows swimmers
to train with a desired race stroke rate and get a feel for what it is like to swim
faster than they can on their own (Girold et al. 2006; Maglischo et al. 1995).
In-Water Stability Training
Just as stability training can be done on dry land, it can be done in the water.
Stability training in the water is often more effective because water is an extremely
unstable surface. Swimmers can be challenged to balance on kickboards or find
creative ways to balance on stability balls in the pool. Ultimately, these types of

--- Page 424 Text ---
|
Strength and Conditioning for Performance Enhancement 413
exercises provide swimmers with additional body control that will help minimize
drag and allow the transference of power from one part of the body to another,
thereby assisting with propulsion.
Creating a Strength-Training
Plan for Swimming
When creating a strength plan for swimmers, coaches need to consider some
foundational principles of program design. These principles have been modi-
fied to reflect the specific demands and challenges of swimming, and the points
made here should be considered when designing a training plan to optimize
performance and reduce the risk of injury.
Using these principles as a guide, coaches should be able to put together a
strength-training program that will enhance swimming performance. Refer to
table 20.2 and the resources referenced in the table to understand the types of
exercises that can be included in a strength and conditioning program that will
develop foundational strength and then progress to building swimming- or
stroke-specific strength and power. Additionally, refer to chapter 9 on periodiza-
tion to understand how training sessions can be structured and organized to
achieve specific strength gains and performance outcomes.
Progressive Overload Principle
The body is remarkable in that it will respond and adapt to the physical and
physiological demands imposed on it, at least to a point (Baechle and Earle
2008). Exercising against resistance stimulates muscles to grow so that they
can produce more strength. But any new physical stimuli should be imposed
progressively, providing small increases in training to avoid overwhelming the
body. Additionally, subsequent challenges must be applied only after the body
has had time to adapt to the initial overload. Increasing training load too much
or too quickly can lead to fatigue and increase an athlete’s risk of injury.
General Adaptation and Recovery
Tied to the concept of progressive overload is the general adaptation syndrome,
which describes how the body responds to stress (Baechle and Earle 2008). In
general, the body responds physically and physiologically to stress with a period
of alarm. When considering strength training and swimming, this alarm response
includes slight muscle breakdown, mild inflammation, bone remodeling, and so
on. But when the stress is removed and the body has an opportunity to recover, it
will become stronger and better able to withstand subsequent stressors. Repeated
stress without time for recovery will continue to break down the body, potentially
putting an athlete in an overtrained state. The need for recovery is discussed in
chapter 13. All coaches and athletes need to understand how to walk the fine
line between providing an appropriate training stimulus and overtraining.

414 Riewald
Exercise Specificity
A certain level of sport specificity should accompany strength training; the
strength training for a given sport must complement the actual sport training and
match the demands of the sport. This point is thought to be especially pertinent
to swimming, which includes the challenge of transferring strength created on
dry land to augment performance in the water. Although some strength can be
transferred from one activity to another, swimmers generally want to engage in
activities that simulate swimming (e.g., swimming against parachutes or a power
rack) in addition to any dryland work. This approach will help to consolidate
dryland strength gains while also building swimming-specific strength.
Exercise Selection and Appropriate Progressions
The goals in strength training for swimming are twofold: to enhance performance
and to prevent injury. Typically, the injury prevention component should be
addressed first to eliminate strength and flexibility imbalances at key locations
throughout the body. After this foundational strength is established, the focus
can be directed to improving swimming-specific strength for performance. Many
exercises build on each another, so without a proper foundation of strength and
control, a swimmer will be unable to realize the gains that could come from
more advanced exercises and may be at a greater risk for injury when performing
them. Take, for example, the muscles that control the shoulder blade kinematics.
Adequate strength is needed in these muscles to ensure that correct shoulder
kinematics is in place before attempting to develop strength that would contrib-
ute more directly to propulsion.
Table 20.2 highlights a variety of strength-training exercises, categorizing them
as either foundational, stroke specific, core, or focused on injury prevention. The
table also identifies the body parts and muscle groups affected by the exercises.
This chapter cannot provide step-by-step descriptions for all these exercises, but
selected core training and injury prevention exercises are described later in the
chapter. Refer to these additional resources to obtain detailed descriptions of
how these exercises should be performed: USA Swimming Task Force on Injury
Prevention 2002; Baechle and Earle 2008; Salo and Riewald 2008; McLeod 2010.
Demand Proper Technique
Swimmers need to perform proper technique on every repetition of every
strength set. Not doing so can subject them to unnecessary injury risks. Consider
a relatively basic rowing exercise. To ensure the health of the shoulder and maxi-
mize performance gains, the shoulder blades need to be set and retracted for each
rowing repetition. Failure to do this does not train the muscles to stabilize the
shoulder girdle appropriately. Similarly, to build power through higher-intensity
exercises such as Olympic lifts or plyometrics, technique is critically important
to avoid inappropriate overloading of the structures of the body.

Train Movements, Not Just Muscles
Muscles and muscle groups work together to produce movements; few (if any)
muscles work in isolation during the execution of a swimming stroke. A swimmer
will have muscles of the arms, upper back, core, and legs all working together.
Although the complete demands of a swimming stroke cannot be mimicked
entirely in one exercise, the muscles should be trained to work together in pat-
terns of movement. For that reason, full-body exercises and exercises that require

--- Page 436 Text ---
|
Strength and Conditioning for Performance Enhancement 425
core stability when executing a distal movement can be extremely powerful in
training swimmers. These types of exercises train muscles to act synergistically,
not in isolation.
Train the Correct Energy Systems
Although energy systems are closely associated with in-water training, they
also need to considered when developing strength-training programs. Should
certain muscle groups be trained for muscular endurance? Absolutely. Take,
for example, the muscles of the rotator cuff and the scapular stabilizers; these
muscles should be trained so that they can generate the necessary force repeat-
edly with limited fatigue. Should other muscle groups be trained for explosive
power? Unquestionably. The leg extensors that propel the start and wall push-
offs, for example, need to be trained in a different manner to promote optimal
performance in the pool.
Exercise Intensity and Volume
Tied to the idea presented in the previous section, to develop muscular endur-
ance, muscles should be trained using a lighter weight but for a higher number of
repetitions. When training for power, besides reducing the number of repetitions
and increasing the rest interval between sets, the exercises should be performed
when the swimmer is completely fresh to maximize the benefits. This require-
ment may mean restructuring some aspects of training sessions to keep from
putting power training at the end of the workout.
Periodization and Complementing In-Water Training
Training should be planned and periodized to apply appropriate stimuli while
also allowing for recovery. This approach will facilitate long-term athlete devel-
opment and at the same time maximize performance at key competitions. With
that said, any strength training should complement the work being done in the
pool. In-water training and strength training are too often seen as independent
activities, so little consideration is given to how a heavy strength-training session
might affect the in-water work and vice versa. Coaches must consider how all
aspects of a training plan interweave to maximize the performance and health
of the swimmer.
Understanding the Kinetic Chain
and Swimming
When planning a strength and conditioning program, coaches need to consider
how the body works and how strength and conditioning can help it work more
effectively. The body is made up of a series of segments that are linked together
to function so that what happens (or does not happen) in one part of the body

--- Page 437 Text ---
}
426 Riewald
affects what occurs elsewhere (Kibler, Press, and Sciascia 2006; Kibler 1998).
This concept, that the body is liked together functionally, has been termed the
kinetic chain. Swimmers who have a strong kinetic chain gain a tremendous
benefit because they can tap into strength throughout the body to generate
propulsive force. For example, power can flow from the legs to the upper body
or from the right side to the left to assist in generating propulsion. But a broken
link in the chain, whether it results from lack of strength, poor muscular control,
or fatigue, compromises the integrity of the entire chain and results in added
physical demands being placed on muscles or structures elsewhere in the body.
For swimmers, in many instances, greater demands are placed on the structures
of the shoulders, increasing the risk of injury. The muscles of the torso, those
that control the motion of the pelvis and link the upper and lower halves of the
body, make up one critically important link in the kinetic chain.
The Core in Swimming
Strength and stability in the muscles surrounding the core of the body are key to
maintaining the integrity of the kinetic chain. The ability to engage the core mus-
culature in the body can have an effect on performance and injury prevention.
We can think of the core as a muscular cylinder surrounding the middle third
of the body made up of all the muscles that surround the body’s center of mass:
• The erector spinae muscles in the lower back contract to extend the lower
back and provide stability to the pelvis.
• The internal and external oblique muscles in the abdomen work together
to rotate the torso, assist in side bending, and provide stability to the pelvis.
The right internal oblique and the left external oblique contract simultane-
ously to produce rotation to the right, and vice versa.
• The transverse abdominis in the lower abdominal region runs laterally
across the abdomen and acts as a corset to provide stability to the pelvis.
• The rectus abdominis muscle forms the six-pack and functions to flex the
trunk and produce forward bending.
In addition, the other muscles that attach to and control the pelvis, spine, and
shoulder girdle can be considered part of the core. Taken together, these muscles
facilitate a wide range of movements throughout the middle third of the body
and provide stability to the pelvis, spine, and shoulder girdle.
A strong and stable core can enhance in-water performance in several ways
(Vorontsov 2011; Salo and Riewald 2008):
• Maintaining a streamlined body position in the water. A strong and stable
core helps swimmers maintain a consistent and efficient body posture in the
water, minimizing unwanted movements and resistance.
• Establishing a stable base of support. A strong core helps swimmers
develop a stronger pull and kick. It’s been said that core stability allows limb

--- Page 438 Text ---
|
Strength and Conditioning for Performance Enhancement 427
mobility (Kibler, Press, and Sciascia 2006). In other words, having core stability
allows swimmers to use their arms and legs for what they’re meant to do—to
generate propulsion. Core stability is more important in swimming than it is in
land-based sports in which an athlete interacts with the ground. The ground-
ing effect seen in land-based sports allows large forces to be generated between
the feet and the ground that can then be transferred through the body. This
energy can power a forehand in tennis or help an offensive lineman drive into
his block. In the water, swimmers have no rigid surface to push against; they are
essentially trying to pull or kick against a surface that is always trying to move
out of the way. Core stability provides the base of support needed to generate
efficient movement and propulsion from the arms and legs.
• Linking the lower body to the upper body. Consider the difficult task of
pushing a string across a desktop. In many ways, this feat is analogous to trying
to generate propulsion from a kick when core stability is poor. A weak core makes
the body function like the floppy string. Creating a rigid link between the upper
body and the lower body allows the swimmer to use the legs to push through the
water rather than rely entirely on the arms to pull the body through the water.
• Contributing to body roll in freestyle and backstroke. Although a number
of factors contribute to body roll, including the kick and a drive from the hips,
the muscles of the body’s core also play a role. This body rotation is necessary
for efficient pulling (and kicking) in freestyle and backstroke.
• Driving the undulation in butterfly and breaststroke. Core stability is
important not only for freestyle and backstroke but also for butterfly and breast-
stroke. A strong core allows the propulsion of the kick to drive the body forward
and adds to the power from the upper body.
Overall, having a stable core will help an athlete swim faster by promoting
more effective and efficient propulsion while also reducing the amount of drag
experienced in the water.
Dryland Training for the Core
Swimming places extra demands on the core and increases the need for dynamic
stability. The focus of core training should be on developing stability, which incor-
porates elements of both strength development and control, not just strength.
Strong core muscles are important, but even the strongest muscles are useless if
they are activated at the wrong time or in the wrong order. Swimming-specific
core exercises should challenge the swimmer to maintain balance and control
of the muscles while also developing strength. This kind of core training work
should translate more readily to performance in the pool. Many athletes have
experienced success engaging in unbalanced training both in and out of the water.
Several examples of exercise progressions that challenge the core and build
stability are presented in the following section (USA Swimming Task Force on
Injury Prevention 2002; Salo and Riewald 2008). The exercises presented here
are general in nature. They establish a foundation of core strength and stability

428 Riewald
and progress to increased strength and power development. In addition, specific
strength programs and exercises can be used to develop specific attributes of
core stability that relate to a specific stroke or athlete. Additional resources are
available that provide more detail and a greater diversity of exercises that can
be used to develop core stability.
Prone Bridge Progression Prone bridging (figure 20.1) involves controlling
the core to maintain a consistent body line, much like swimmers need in the water.
The focus of these exercises is to maintain a straight line from the ankles through
the hips to the shoulders while balancing on the forearms and toes. Athletes
should work to maintain this form even as balance becomes challenged and the
stabilizing muscles become fatigued.
a
b
 Figure 20.1 Prone bridge progression. The prone bridge chal-
lenges the core musculature increasingly as the athlete reduces the
points of contact with the ground. In this case, the athlete progresses
from (a) having the toes and forearms in contact with the ground
to (b) having the toes or elbows in contact with an unstable surface
such as a stability ball.

Strength and Conditioning for Performance Enhancement 429
Back Bridge Progres-
sion Back-bridging exer-
cises (figure 20.2) target
the entire core, requiring
those muscles to help main-
tain a consistent body line
from the shoulders through
a
the hips to the knees and
ankles. Again, as the exer-
cise increases in difficulty,
the core will be required
to stabilize the body in
increasingly demanding,
dynamic situations.
b
 Figure 20.2 Back bridge progression. The back
bridge challenges the core musculature increasingly
as the athlete adds limb movements to the exercise.
The athlete progresses from (a) performing a basic
back bridge to (b) executing alternate knee exten-
sions while maintaining a consistent body position
through the core.
Side Bridge Side bridging (figure 20.3) develops strength in the muscles that
make up the sides of the core. Because these muscles also help a great deal with
initiating and controlling body rotation, developing strength and stability in this
area is critical. To increase difficulty and challenge stability, athletes can perform
single-arm rows using elastic tubing while maintaining the side bridge position.
 Figure 20.3 Side bridge. The side bridge challenges the oblique
muscles while the athlete tries to maintain a constant body line.

Bird Dog Progression The bird dog exercise is designed to improve strength
and control of the core muscles, particularly the muscles of lower back, while
requiring the swimmer to produce movement of the arms and legs (figure 20.4).
Additional challenges can be added by forcing the swimmer to perform the exer-
cise while balanced on an unstable surface.
a
b
 Figure 20.4 Bird dog progression. The bird dog exercise challenges
the extensor muscles in the lower back and becomes increasingly diffi-
cult as the stability of the surface that the athlete interacts with changes.
In this case, the athlete progresses from (a) having one hand and knee
in contact with the ground to (b) having only the toes and hand in
contact with the ground while balancing the torso on a stability ball.

Strength and Conditioning for Performance Enhancement 431
Leg Drop Progression The leg drop (figure 20.5) requires core stability with
rotation and carries over well to performance in the pool. The basic premise of the
exercise is that the swimmer allows the knees to drop to the side of the body in a
controlled manned, requiring activation of the obliques and other core muscles.
Additional challenges are provided by lifting the feet off the floor.
a
b
 Figure 20.5 Leg drop progression. The leg drop progression
requires the swimmer to maintain stability with torso rotation. (a) The
basic form of the exercise is to control rotation as the knees drop to
the floor while both feet are in contact with the ground. (b) Difficulty
is added by controlling the knee drop after lifting the feet off the floor.
After a base level of strength is developed in the core, additional challenges
can be provided by performing more advanced, dynamic exercises that require
higher forces, high movement velocity, or an increased need for stability. The
following are some examples of more advanced exercises:

In-Water Core Training Exercises
Because swimmers train and compete in the water, they often benefit by engaging
in some strengthening exercises that take place in the water. Placing swimmers
in an unbalanced situation in the water will help facilitate the development of
swimming-specific core stability.
Front-Side and Back-Side Balance Drill The front-side balance drill (figure
20.6a) requires the swimmer to maintain a streamlined position on the belly while
balancing on a floatation device designed to introduce greater instability than
what the water provides on its own. The back-side balance drill (figure 20.6b) is
performed much like the front-side exercise except that it requires the swimmer
to maintain a streamlined position on the back while balancing on a floatation
device. As swimmers become more proficient at these exercises, they can add
more kickboards to the stack that they are balancing on. The increased buoyancy
provides more instability while continually challenging the core. An even greater
challenge can be achieved by having the swimmers balance on a stability ball in
the water.
b
 Figure 20.6 Front-side and back-side balance drill. Swim-
mers should be encouraged to work on their balance in the
water. A way to do this is to ask the swimmer to balance on
a kickboard or stack of kickboards floating (a) on her front or
(b) on her back. Difficulty can be increased by adding more
kickboards to the stack.

Strength and Conditioning
for Injury Prevention
Chapter 18 deals specifically with injuries in swimming. Strength training
can help prevent these injuries, particularly injuries to the shoulder. Although
improper technique definitely contributes to shoulder injuries, so do strength
and flexibility imbalances in the shoulder, upper back, and core. In swimmers,
the shoulder internal rotators are often stronger than the external rotators, cre-
ating a strength imbalance within the rotator cuff. Additionally, the external
rotators tend to fatigue more quickly when this strength imbalance exists. The
fact that the internal rotators are preferentially stronger makes sense given the
degree to which they are used in the competitive swimming strokes; the external
rotators are hardly activated. Maintaining a strength balance in the shoulder is
important because both muscle groups work together to keep the ball-and-socket
joint properly aligned. When the normal force balance is upset in the shoulder,
the risk of impingement increases. Swimmers need to take deliberate steps to
strengthen the external rotators to restore normal strength balance in the shoul-
der while also building endurance to allow the shoulder to function properly.
When shoulder pain does occur, the assumption naturally made is that the
root cause of the pain lies in the ball-and-socket joint itself. Recall, however,
that a weak link or break anywhere in the kinetic chain can place undue stress
on the shoulder. Fatigue or weakness in the scapular stabilizers, which causes a
breakdown in scapular kinematics, often contributes to shoulder pain (McMaster
1999; Bak 2010; USA Swimming Task Force on Injury Prevention 2002; Rodeo
2004; Scovazzo et al. 1991). For the ball-and-socket joint to function properly, a
swimmer needs to have excellent strength and control of the muscles that control
the shoulder blades. In a healthy shoulder in which the scapular stabilizers are
strong, the shoulder blades stay flush against the torso throughout the move-
ment, thus maintaining proper alignment of the glenohumeral joint.
The serratus anterior is one scapular stabilizer that deserves special attention.
This muscle wraps around the rib cage and is active throughout much of the
freestyle stroke cycle. The serratus anterior has been found to fatigue quickly in
swimmers with shoulder pain (Scovazzo et al. 1991). Most traditional strength-
ening exercises do not target this muscle, so exercises for this muscle need to be
specifically included in a swimmer’s strength-training plan.
Strength Training to Prevent Shoulder Injury
A swimmer can do a number of strengthening exercises to protect the health of
the shoulder (USA Swimming Task Force on Injury Prevention 2002; Salo and
Riewald 2008). The ones presented here have been selected because they target
the strength imbalances and areas of weakness most often seen in swimmers and
they promote healthy joint function while also strengthening the kinetic chain.
Swimmers should follow some general guidelines when performing these
exercises:

--- Page 445 Text ---
}
434 Riewald
• Use very light weights. The muscles being trained are small. Using weights
that are too heavy will engage other muscles.
• Focus on endurance. Swimmers should perform two or three sets of 15 to
25 repetitions of each exercise.
• Control the movements. Swimmers should not race to see who can perform
these the fastest. They should use slow, deliberate movements and focus
on retracting and setting the shoulder blades at the start of each repetition.
• Develop consistency. These exercises should be performed at least two or
three times per week. Doing these exercises is important even if a swimmer
is not injured. Injury prevention should be a priority at all times of the year.
• Maintain proper form. If a swimmer cannot maintain the correct technique,
the exercise should be stopped.
• Avoid pain. If a swimmer has a preexisting injury or if any of these exercises
cause pain, the activity should be stopped. Although these exercises should
produce a muscle burn, they should never cause pain.
Scapular Retraction: Setting the Shoulder Blades This exercise (figure 20.7)
strengthens the scapular stabilizers in the upper back. It is the most basic of the
upper-back exercises and serves as the starting point for many of the rotator cuff
and upper-back exercises that follow. The instructions to the athlete should be to
pinch the shoulder blades together in the middle of the back.

Standing External Rotation This exercise (figure 20.9) builds strength in the
external rotators of the rotator cuff. As with all rotator cuff exercises, the athlete
should retract the scapulae before each repetition.

Catch Position External Rotation This exercise (figure 20.10) strengthens
the external rotators of the rotator cuff. It is more complicated than the standing
external rotation exercise because the swimmer is required to stabilize the shoul-
der and shoulder blades to a greater degree. But this exercise is more swimming
specific because the movement mimics the shoulder action during the catch in
freestyle and butterfly. If the exercise is done correctly, the upper arm should not
move during the execution of the exercise.

This exercise (figure 20.11) strengthens the muscles of the rotator cuff and improves
overall shoulder stability. Swimmers should stay away from the empty-can exercise,
in which the thumbs are pointed downward (shoulders internally rotated) through
the movement because this action can create additional irritation for the tendons
in the shoulder.

Strength Training for Prevention of Other Injuries
Besides the shoulder, the next most common injury sites are the knee (patel-
lofemoral pain and medial collateral ligament sprains) and the back. The most
common injuries in these areas seem to result from a combination of overuse,
muscle weakness, and poor flexibility, all of which can be addressed through
a strength and conditioning program that targets strength development, the
appropriate balance between muscular endurance and power, and flexibility.
For the knee, balanced strength needs to be developed through the legs. In
many instances, the swimmer needs to build overall leg strength and strength
in the hamstrings in particular to maintain a normal flexor-to-extensor strength
ratio around the knee. Table 20.2 provides additional exercises that can be used
to develop foundational strength in the lower body and help prevent injury.
For back health, the muscles of the core need to be strengthened to provide
stability to the pelvis and maintain an appropriate posture in the water. In many
instances, swimmers demonstrate tight hip flexors, resulting in an anterior pelvic
tilt and the adoption of a kyphotic posture in the lower back (excessive curvature).
This position not only compromises body position and the ability to generate an
effective kick but also contributes to lower-back pain. Static stretching of the hip
flexors (figure 20.15) can help restore normal hip posture, positively affecting
both health and performance.
 Figure 20.15 Hip flexor stretch. Developing adequate flexibility through the hip
flexors will help the swimmer maintain proper body position in the water as well as
improve the efficiency of the flutter or butterfly kick.

Flexibility Training for Swimming
Stretching often goes hand in hand with discussions on strength training.
Optimal muscle function is based on establishing a balance between strength
and flexibility. Having muscular strength is important, but being able to pro-
duce force through a full range of motion is what allows swimmers to become
truly proficient in the water. As such, flexibility training is just as important to
a swimmer’s performance as strength training.
Just as swimmers develop strength imbalances throughout the body, many
also develop flexibility imbalances. Flexibility imbalances can be seen in the
shoulders of many swimmers, particularly in the direction of internal rotation
(Spiegelman 2006; Torres and Gomes 2009). Nonathletes commonly have 70
degrees of internal rotation at the shoulder, but research conducted on a group of
collegiate swimmers showed that they had only 49 degrees of internal rotation,
a deficit of more than 20 degrees (Spiegelman 2006). This deficit is even greater
than what has been found for athletes who participate in sports such as baseball
and tennis that are thought to place more stress on the shoulder. Although these
swimmers exhibited slightly greater external rotation than nonathletes did, they
still showed an overall range-of-motion deficit of 10 degrees at the shoulder. In
sports such as tennis, similar internal rotation deficits develop over time and are
linked to increased risk of injury. Internal rotation flexibility deficits will likely
continue to worsen in swimmers unless flexibility training is used to improve
range of motion.
Swimmers often experience tightness of muscles on the anterior (front) side
of the body, including the hip flexors. When these muscles are tight, they pull
the pelvis into a position of anterior pelvic tilt, which affects performance both
by inhibiting an athlete’s ability to maintain a streamlined position (increased
drag) and by reducing the ability to produce an effective and propulsive kick
(reduced propulsion).
With that said, in all instances swimmers should strive to achieve a normal
range of motion about the joints. Swimmers have an optimal range of flexibil-
ity that places them at the lowest risk of injury. If a swimmer falls outside this
normal range, either because muscles are extremely tight or because joints are
hyperflexible, the risk of injury increases. Regular stretching should be a regular
part of a swimmer’s training to maximize performance and reduce injury risk.
Flexibility is a term used to describe the elasticity of muscles and other struc-
tures that surround a joint. Static flexibility is the range of motion measured at
a joint while maintaining a stationary position. In other words, no movement
occurs. Most athletes are familiar with static stretching, which typically involves
stretching a muscle or muscle group and holding that position for 20 to 30 sec-
onds. Dynamic flexibility is flexibility with movement. It can be thought of as
the range of motion available to swimmers while they are actually swimming.
Although dynamic flexibility may seem to be the more important component for
swimmers, both types of flexibility are important to swimmers. Regular static

--- Page 454 Text ---
|
Strength and Conditioning for Performance Enhancement 443
stretching is an important and necessary first step toward developing greater
dynamic flexibility and improving in-pool performance.
Static stretching should be performed at the end of a practice, not before.
Muscles are most pliable when they are warm, so the end of practice is an ideal
time to work on flexibility training. In addition, static stretching before a practice
or event may actually impair performance. Recent research has shown that static
stretching can impair the ability of a muscle to generate peak forces and power
for as long as an hour after the stretch is performed. In a sport such as swim-
ming, which requires virtually all the muscles in the body to produce force and
power, static stretching before a workout has the potential to limit performance.
Although this phenomenon has not been studied specifically in swimming, the
results of swimming-specific research would be unlikely to produce results that
are different from what has been seen in other sports.
If swimmers need to stretch before a training session or competition, they
should try to stretch at least one hour beforehand to allow the muscle contractile
properties that contribute to optimal performance to be restored.
The following are some additional guidelines for static stretching:
• Stretches should be performed two or three times and held for 20 to 30
seconds. This approach will produce the greatest gains in flexibility. Hold-
ing the stretch longer does not seem to produce any additional benefits.
• Flexibility training should be treated as a part of a swimmer’s overall train-
ing program. Flexibility does not improve overnight. Making a change
requires including flexibility training in the daily routine. Try to devote 10
to 15 minutes every day to stretching. Although a single stretching session
can improve flexibility for up to 90 minutes, we are looking for long-term
flexibility gains that come only with time.
• Stretch both sides of the body. Swimming is a bilateral activity, so the
muscles on both sides of the body need to be stretched.
• Stretch progressively and within limits. Athletes should not try to do too
much or stretch a muscle group too vigorously. Additionally, they should
avoid bouncing to try to get a deeper stretch in a muscle.
• Stretching should never be painful. Swimmers should feel tension in the
stretched muscle, but stretching should never hurt. If athletes do feel pain,
they should stop the stretch.
One of the most beneficial stretches for improving or maintaining range of
motion at the shoulder is the sleeper stretch (figure 20.16). This stretch targets
the external rotators and posterior shoulder capsule, thus improving the range
of motion into internal rotation.
Note that in some people, being too loose in the shoulder (a condition called
hyperlaxity), not being too tight, is what contributes to injury. The shoulder
joint is surrounded by a joint capsule. This structure provides some stability
to the joint and keeps the ball-and-socket positioned correctly. When the front

part of the shoulder joint capsule becomes overstretched, the shoulder does
not move properly and impingement is more likely to occur. Many swimmers
unknowingly contribute to this condition by performing the arms behind the
back shoulder stretch (figure 20.17). This stretch can be detrimental to the health
of the shoulder because it primarily stretches the joint capsule and not the chest
or shoulder muscles.
a b

muscles, is the chest stretch.

The Warm-Up and Swimming
The warm-up is often thought of as a part of a strength and conditioning program.
It can provide many benefits in swimming. The basic purpose of the warm-up
is literally to warm the body by increasing muscle and core body temperature.
When the body is warm, the muscles are able to function more efficiently
because they contract with greater force through a greater range of motion. A
good warm-up also does a number of other things to get the body physically
ready for high-intensity swimming:
• The warm-up primes the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, enhancing
the body’s ability to pump blood and deliver oxygen to the working muscles.
• The warm-up develops dynamic flexibility or flexibility with motion. It
puts muscles and joints through their range of motion, actively enhancing
flexibility and improving stroke efficiency.
• It gets the body’s biochemistry working optimally. All of the body’s physi-
ological systems need to be warmed up to optimal levels to support high-
intensity swimming.
• It gets the mind talking with the muscles, improving coordination and the
efficiency of movement.
• It helps reduce the risk of injury. Jumping right into high-intensity swim-
ming without warming up puts the body at increased risk of injury ranging
from muscle pulls to heart complications. Easing into a practice by using a
warm-up can help reduce those risks.
Conducting an in-water warm-up immediately before a competition event is
often not possible. Although swimmers typically are able to warm up before the
start of competition, not every event provides a warm-up pool where athletes can
warm up between races. In these cases, performing a dryland dynamic warm-up
is beneficial. Dynamic warm-up exercises involve movement and are designed
to improve dynamic flexibility while also elevating body temperature (Salo and
Riewald 2008). The exercises selected should target the specific muscle groups
used in swimming, and each exercise should be performed for 15 to 30 seconds.
The total dynamic warm-up should take 5 to 10 minutes to complete. Rubber
tubing can be used to facilitate dynamic exercises, which can be swimming
specific and therefore enhance the dryland warm-up procedure.
Special Considerations for
the Young Swimmer
Many questions have been asked about the appropriateness of having young,
prepubescent athletes engage in strength training. Concerns exist about increas-
ing the risk of injury, stunting growth, and negatively affecting normal growth
and development. But the American College of Sports Medicine (Faigenbaum

--- Page 457 Text ---
}
446 Riewald
and Micheli 2013), the American Academy of Pediatrics (Council on Sports
Medicine and Fitness 2008), and the National Strength and Conditioning
Association (Faigenbaum et al. 2009) have all issued position papers or public
comments stating that strength training is appropriate and safe for children
if proper supervision and technique instruction are provided. The American
College of Sports Medicine in Current Comment on Youth Strength Training states,
Contrary to the traditional belief that strength training is dangerous for
children or that it could lead to bone plate disturbances, the American
College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) contends that strength training can
be a safe and effective activity for this age group, provided that the pro-
grams are properly designed and competently supervised. (Faigenbaum
and Micheli 2013)
This sentiment has been echoed by all other organizations and professionals
in the strength-training community (Faigenbaum 2012). The National Strength
and Conditioning Association, in their position statement on youth resistance
training, put forward seven key statements to describe a properly designed and
supervised resistance-training program:
1. It is relatively safe for youth.
2. It enhances the muscular strength and power of youth.
3. It improves the cardiovascular risk profile of youth.
4. It improves motor skill performance and may contribute to enhanced sports
performance of youth.
5. It increases a young athlete’s resistance to sports-related injuries.
6. It helps improve the psychosocial well-being of youth.
7. It helps promote and develop exercise habits during childhood and ado-
lescence.
Another question that often comes up with younger swimmers is, “Does
strength training actually help a young swimmer?” The short answer is, “Yes,
it does.” Although testosterone, a steroid produced naturally in the body pre-
dominantly after puberty, is necessary to build muscle mass and strength, young
athletes can see improvements in motor control and strength after being engaged
in a strength and conditioning program. Several benefits to young athletes have
been documented:
• Increased strength and coordination through improved neuromuscular
function
• Increased bone density
• Improved self-image and self-confidence
• Potential to prevent injuries

--- Page 458 Text ---
|
Strength and Conditioning for Performance Enhancement 447
All these attributes should be appealing to young swimmers.
Kraemer and Fleck (2005) capture all these ideas in their youth strength-
training progression model in which they lay out appropriate exercises and
training techniques for athletes of various ages. Their model offers the following
key take-home messages:
• Athletes 7 years old and under should perform exercises with little or no
weight and focus on learning proper technique. As they develop physically
and emotionally, the complexity of the exercises and the volume and inten-
sity of the training should increase.
• From 8 to 10 years of age, athletes should gradually increase the number
of exercises, the number of repetitions, and training volume while still
performing relatively simple exercises.
• From 11 to 13 years old, athletes can do more advanced exercises, but they
should be done with no weight while technique is emphasized.
• From 14 to 16 years old, athletes should continue to increase training volume
while adding sport-specific exercises to the training plan.
• Above 16 years of age, athletes should progress into an adult-style program
but only after they have mastered all techniques and have adequate train-
ing experience.
Coaches need to set appropriate strength and conditioning goals when work-
ing with young swimmers. The general themes surrounding strength training
for the young athlete should be preventing injury, building athleticism, engrain-
ing proper exercise technique, and developing endurance. The technique work
put in during this developmental phase lays the foundation for more advanced
training down the road as the swimmer gets older. Although power develop-
ment may be an appropriate goal for an older athlete, it should not be the focus
of the training plan for a young swimmer because of the loads that this type
of training can place on the body. When proper technique is emphasized and
every strength-training session is conducting by a qualified and certified strength
coach, young swimmers who are engaged in a strength-training program have
a very low risk of injury.
When looking specifically at the research on strength training for the young
swimmer and its effect on swimming performance, limited data are available
to draw from. Several studies, however, show favorable improvements in per-
formance following strength training (Bulgakova, Vorontsov, and Fomichenko
1990; Blanksby and Gregor 1981), although results from at least one other study
have shown no positive relationship between development of power and flip
turn performance (Cossor, Blanksby, and Elliot 1999).

Summary
This chapter provides a number of take-home messages that can help coaches
develop and modify a strength and conditioning program for swimmers.
Strength gains made on dry land or in the water can positively affect swimming
performance. The relationship between strength and propulsion should not be
the sole focus, because performance gains can also be realized when a swim-
mer maintains a good, consistent body line in the water, thereby reducing drag.
Strength training for injury prevention should be targeted to areas of the
body where strength imbalances frequently exist (e.g., shoulders and scapular
stabilizers) or where the links in the kinetic chain are weak (e.g., core).
An appropriate strength-training program for swimmers should integrate
multiple training modalities that include dryland and in-pool training. Resisted
swimming exercises are a sport-specific training modality that positively corre-
lates with swimming performance. Coaches should build foundational strength
in swimmers before working on swimming-specific strength exercises or power
exercises.
Don’t be afraid to engage even the youngest swimmer in a strength-training
program. Focus on teaching technique and building foundational strength,
using exercises that require little or no weight. Engrain the concepts behind
strengthening for injury prevention and lay a foundation that will be useful to
the athletes as they develop.
Do not forget about flexibility training but be sure to conduct static stretch-
ing at the end of training, not before. Full-body flexibility is important, but the
focus should be on areas where flexibility imbalances are known to develop
in swimmers (shoulder internal rotation, hip flexor tightness). Also, strive to
achieve normal ranges of motion about joints; excessive flexibility can be just
as damaging to performance and joint health as too little flexibility.
Finally, be creative and have fun. You can train strength in swimmers in many
ways. Strength training should be an enjoyable experience that never gets old.
Enjoy applying this information with your swimmers.

CHAPTER
Adolescent Swimmers
—Jordan D. Metzl, MD, and Morgan A. Busko, MD
Adolescent swimmers face a variety of unique issues because of the demanding
nature of the sport and the uniqueness of the developing adolescent body.
Parents, coaches, and athletes should be aware of the physical, psychological, and
physiological changes that young swimmers undergo and the way in which these
changes affect their athletic performance. This chapter discusses the demands
of swimming on the developing body, health concerns specific to the adolescent
swimmer, and the most common injury patterns and medical concerns seen
in these athletes. It provides the latest research on the recommended training
volume as well as various types of preventive strength training for adolescent
swimmers. The goal of this chapter is to discuss methods of ensuring health
and safety for adolescent swimmers.
Sport Specialization
Should adolescent swimmers be committed to swimming year round at the
expense of engaging in other sports? Year-round training in a single sport during
the adolescent years is becoming increasingly common, particularly among youth
swimmers. In a study of university-aged female athletes, swimmers stood out
among the diving, tennis, golf, track and field, basketball, and volleyball athletes
as being the only athletes who had their first organized sport experience in their
current sport (Malina 2010). In short, swimmers enter the sport early and stay
with it. Additionally, the general perception is that to succeed at swimming,
early sport specialization is beneficial for most swimmers.
Too much of a good thing, however, can cause problems. Year-round swim-
ming without involvement in other sports is one of the leading causes for ado-
lescent swim injuries. New evidence has shown that the sheer quantity of strokes
451

--- Page 463 Text ---
}
452 Metzl and Busko
and the length of time involved in the sport, two measures of training volume,
are the two best predictors of overuse injury in swimming (Bak 2010). Choosing
to specialize in swimming at an early age often results in repeated microtrauma
and persistent loading of tissues that are not yet at full strength or development.
To prevent pediatric overuse injuries, the American Academy of Pediatrics and
the National Athletic Trainer Association both recommend that adolescent ath-
letes not be committed to one sport year round until midadolescence (American
Academy of Pediatrics 2000). Coaches and parents should encourage adolescent
swimmers to join other sport teams or engage in other activities that enhance
their motor development and allow their swimming-specific muscles to rest.
United States Swimming has recommendations for the maximum training
volume for adolescent swimmers, which directly address the issues of swim
volume in growing teens. For 11- to 14-year-old swimmers who are developing
basic skills, no more than 4 to 6 sessions per week (60 to 90 minutes per ses-
sion) are recommended. If athletes are participating year round, simultaneous
activities should be encouraged to decrease the time in the water and increase
weight-bearing exercise. Adolescents who are participating only in swimming
should take two to three months, preferably nonconsecutive, off from competitive
swimming. For 13- to 18-year-olds, the maximum training load is 6 to 10 sessions
per week (90 to 120 minutes per session). This age is the time of youth when
many swimmers commit to year-round competition, but sport specialization
is encouraged only for advanced swimmers 14 years or older who demonstrate
the potential to reach an elite level. For this small group of elite adolescents,
the USA Swimming organization recommends a maximum of 8 to 10 sessions
per week (90 to 120 minutes per session) and recognizes that year-round com-
petition with short periods of rest is essential to avoiding loss of aerobic fitness
(USA Swimming 2010).
Parents and coaches often question whether their children or athletes can
compete at an elite level if they are not swimming at a high training volume
year round, but the reality is that few adolescent swimmers have the potential
to reach that elite level. Because of the fragile nature of the human body during
development, adolescents who choose to specialize in swimming at an early age
may be more prone to injury, burnout, and long-term health issues, as discussed
later in the chapter.
The Developing Adolescent Athlete
The adolescent years are a period of great importance in the development of the
adult skeleton and the mature athlete. Adolescent development is a combina-
tion of physical, physiological, and psychological changes during the teenage
years that have a large effect on athletic performance. The physical changes of
the body are most significant during puberty, a time marked by sexual develop-
ment, an increase in gender-specific hormones, and rapid growth. Surging levels
of the steroid hormone estrogen in females and rising levels of testosterone
in males are responsible for the constant state of evolution during this time,

--- Page 464 Text ---
|

which is easily seen in rapid changes in height, weight, and physique (Metzl
and Shookhoff 2002).
The changes in height, weight, and body contour are the result of rapid growth
of the bones and muscles. The long bones in the body have epiphyseal plates,
known as growth plates, which are regions of cartilage present only until the
body stops growing. Around the end of puberty, the cartilage cells in the growth
plate stop replicating, and the plate is slowly replaced by bone until it becomes
the epiphyseal line, which no longer has growth potential. These growth plates
are the weakest part of the skeleton, and their fragility makes them a common
site of injury among young athletes. The plates are often weaker than the liga-
ments and tendons that surround them, so injuries that might result in a joint
sprain for an adult can cause a growth plate fracture in an adolescent (Metzl
and Shookhoff 2002).
During these periods of rapid skeletal growth, the muscles are also growing,
but they may not grow at the same pace as the bones. The result can be a notice-
able loss of flexibility. The slower muscular growth leads to increasing tension,
tightness, and aches. Stretching is the most important remedy to prevent muscu-
lar injury as this natural phenomenon occurs. Because of the delicate nature of
the developing body, adolescent athletes must take special precaution to protect
their bones, muscles, and ligaments (Metzl and Shookhoof 2002).
Physiological changes related to growth and development accompany the
more apparent pubertal changes. Adolescent athletes experience noticeable gains
.
in their maximal oxygen uptake (VOmax), anaerobic capacity, and muscular
. 2
strength (Geithner et al. 2004). VOmax is the maximum capacity of a person’s
2
body to transport and use oxygen during exercise of increasing intensity. Oxygen,
which is carried in the blood, is the limiting factor in endurance exercise because
it is required for the generation of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the
form of energy that muscles use. As the heart muscle gains strength during
adolescent development, it is able to pump more oxygen through the blood to
.
the rest of the muscles in the body. Therefore, VOmax is a strong reflection of
2
a person’s physiological fitness, and it is considered the single best indicator of
cardiovascular fitness and maximal aerobic power in adolescents. An increase
.
in VOmax as adolescents mature is one of the driving forces behind improved
2
performance in endurance sports such as swimming, cycling, rowing, cross-
country skiing, and running. As adolescents grow and mature, they are stronger
and more physiologically able to tolerate longer periods of exercise and activity
(Geithner et al. 2004).
Health Concerns Specific
to the Adolescent Swimmer
Adolescent athletes in every sport take certain precautions to prevent injury and
damage to the body during the growing years. A variety of health concerns are
specific to the adolescent swimmer. Low bone mineral density, the female-athlete

triad, and exercise-induced bronchospasm are three of these health concerns.
In addition, specific musculoskeletal injuries are prevalent among adolescent
swimmers because of the repetitive nature of the sport. Young athletes, parents,
and coaches should be familiar with these health concerns so that athletes can
participate in exercises and routines that will help to prevent them.
Bone Mineral Density
Why should adolescent swimmers be concerned about their bone mineral den-
sity (BMD)? Bone mineral density is the ratio of weight to the volume or area of
the bones. Low BMD and osteoporosis (decreased bone density) have a positive
association, so BMD is an indirect indicator of fracture risk. During adolescence,
more bone is deposited than is withdrawn, so an increase in bone density par-
allels the growth in bone size. Peak bone mass is the greatest amount of bone
mass that will be present throughout life at a specific site in the skeleton. Bone
mass increases during childhood and puberty, reaches a peak around the age of
30, and then declines with age (Rizzoli et al. 2010). Therefore, the bone being
formed during the adolescent years determines the athlete’s eventual BMD, which
is a key determinant of adult skeletal health (Rizzoli et al. 2010).
Adolescent swimmers are at particular risk for low BMD because the sport
does not involve any weight-bearing activity. Weight-bearing exercise is any force-
generating activity that creates a large compressive force on the bones, which has
a positive effect on osteogenic (formation of new bone) activity (Whalen and
Carter 1988). Evidence indicates that the effects of weight-bearing exercise on
bone are more effective if the exercise occurs before or at the time of the ado-
lescent growth spurt (Witzke and Snow 2000). Several studies have compared
the total body BMD and regional BMD (lumbar spine, femoral neck, and leg) of
adolescents who are participating in either weight-bearing or non-weight-bearing
exercise. These studies demonstrate that runners and athletes who participate
in weight-bearing sports have significantly higher total body BMD and regional
BMD than swimmers (Silva et al. 2011; Pettersson et al. 2000).
Because of the non-weight-bearing nature of the sport, both male and female
adolescent swimmers who are not participating in other weight-bearing forms
of exercise are at a higher risk for osteoporosis and osteopenia (an early stage
of osteoporosis) later in life. The American College of Sports Medicine recom-
mends that adolescent swimmers incorporate into their weekly training plans
at least three days of 10 to 20 minutes of impact activity (Kohrt et al. 2004). In
addition, swimmers can promote bone growth by engaging in weight-bearing
sports during swimming’s off-season.
What else can adolescent swimmers do to maximize their BMD during this
critical period of growth? Numerous studies have demonstrated that BMD
increases with increasing muscle strength (Nichols, Sanborn, and Love 2001).
Strength training stimulates an increase in BMD beyond what occurs naturally;
these positive results have been seen with both resistance training and plyometric
jump training (Blimkie et al. 1996; Witzke and Snow 2000). Strength-training

exercises that are recommended specifically for adolescent swimmers are dis-
cussed later in this chapter.
Several cross-sectional studies show that weight-bearing exercise must be
coupled with sufficient calcium intake to have a positive association with BMD
(Kanders, Dempster, and Lindsay 1998; Chan 1991). When the body is not
receiving adequate calcium, it takes calcium from the only source that it has—the
bones. The U.S. national recommendations for calcium intake for 11- to 24-year-
olds is 1,300 milligrams per day, which can be obtained through four servings
of calcium-rich foods or drinks, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese (French, Fulk-
erson, and Story 2000). Nonfood calcium supplements containing between 300
and 1,000 milligrams have also demonstrated positive effects on BMD during
the adolescent years (Lloyd et al. 1993; Nowson et al. 1997). Therefore, besides
eating calcium-rich foods, young swimmers should take a calcium supplement
with added vitamin D every day to protect their bones.
Female Athlete Triad
Adolescent female swimmers with low BMD are subject to the female athlete
triad, which is a serious health concern that is being seen with increasing fre-
quency (Golden 2002). This topic is discussed in detail in chapter 23, but to
review here, the three components of the triad are anorexia (insufficient caloric
intake), amenorrhea (absence of menstrual periods), and osteoporosis (decreased
bone density). Sustained anorexia leads to a significant decline in available
energy, which causes the amenorrhea and osteoporosis because of the body’s
physiological response to decreasing body fat percentages that result from energy
deprivation. Energy availability is the energy consumed through the diet minus
the energy expended through exercise. Figure 21.1 demonstrates the range of
energy availability, which is the amount of energy available after exercise for the
remainder of bodily functions such as cellular maintenance, thermoregulation,
growth, and reproduction (Nattiv et al. 2007).

Energy deficiency can be a result of the disease anorexia nervosa, an eating
disorder depicted by conscious restrictive eating and distorted body image. Sus-
tained low energy availability because of long-term anorexia nervosa can lead
to complications involving the cardiovascular, endocrine, reproductive, skeletal,
gastrointestinal, renal, and central nervous systems (Nattiv et al. 2007). This
psychological issue needs to be addressed by a multidisciplinary team of health
care professionals, a registered dietitian, the family and coach of the athlete, and
a mental health practitioner.
Not all athletes with low body fat percentages have an eating disorder. Low
energy availability may also be unintentional, which is common among rapidly
growing, active females who perform high training volumes, such as adolescent
swimmers during puberty. When young females remain in low energy states,
depicted by the triangle on the left of figure 21.1, the hormones that stimulate
bone formation are decreased and the estrogen no longer performs its normal
role in preventing bone resorption. These hormonal alterations are responsible
for the poor bone health characteristic of the female athlete triad. An athlete’s
BMD is a reflection of her menstrual history and her current and past energy
availability (Nattiv et al. 2007).
Low energy availability before puberty has been shown to delay sexual develop-
ment and suppress growth. Primary amenorrhea is the absence of menstruation
after the age of 15 or after the athlete has gone through other pubertal changes,
and it can be a red flag for the female athlete triad. Secondary amenorrhea is char-
acterized by more than three months of no menstrual cycles after having normal
menstrual cycles. Amenorrhea has many causes, but the absence of menses in
the female athlete triad occurs because the pituitary gland is not secreting pulses
of luteinizing hormone, which is normally secreted at specific intervals through-
out the day. Young swimmers can experience amenorrhea even without dietary
restriction if their volume of habitual, strenuous physical activity is too high.
Coaches, parents, and athletes should all be aware of the female athlete triad
so that it can be addressed early to minimize the negative effects of the energy
deficit on the body. Restoring regular menses will not return a young female to
her best possible bone health, but her BMD will start to improve as the hormones
return to normal function. Health care professionals stress prevention, early
recognition, and treatment of the female athlete triad because the consequences
of these conditions are potentially irreversible (Wade, Schneider, and Li 1996).
Exercise-Induced Bronchospasm
What is exercise-induced bronchospasm (EIB), and why is it so common among
adolescent swimmers? EIB is a temporary condition of respiratory difficulty
because of a sudden constriction of the muscles in the walls of the lung’s bron-
chioles. Although 90 percent of asthmatics experience EIB, 10 percent of the
nonasthmatic population is also subject to this condition. It can be caused by
medical conditions, medications, and environmental factors, and it is triggered
by aerobic exercise. The diagnosis of EIB is based on a demonstrated reduction in

--- Page 468 Text ---
|
Adolescent Swimmers 457
an athlete’s forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), as well as a thorough
history that indicates shortness of breath during exercise, tight chest, coughing,
wheezing, and decreased exercise endurance. The physical exam of an athlete
with EIB will usually present as normal.
Studies indicate an increased prevalence of EIB among swimmers, and ado-
lescent swimmers are particularly prone to this condition for several reasons
(Helenius et al. 1998). The first is the demanding nature of the sport on the
lungs. During exercise, particularly endurance training, increasing ventila-
tion leads to the loss of heat and water through respiration, which causes the
bronchial constriction. After years of training, the respiratory mucosa becomes
increasingly inflamed and the epithelium can be damaged, causing symptoms
to worsen over time.
The training environment of adolescent swimmers is the second reason that
they are at increased risk of EIB. Training in chlorinated pools, in which chloro-
form and other organic compounds are formed, is an environmental cause for
EIB (Drobnic et al. 1996). Evidence for this is found in studies that demonstrate
significantly higher onset of EIB among swimmers when compared with runners
and cyclists (Williams, Schwellnus, and Noakes 2004). Despite the fact that chlo-
rine concentrations in pool environments are kept at acceptable levels, extensive
exercise in the presence of these “safe” chlorine levels produces abnormal levels
of exposure to the toxin chloroform. A direct association is seen between the
water chloroform level, the chloroform concentration in the environmental air,
and the chloroform level in the blood plasma (Aiking et al. 1994). Swimming in
a poorly ventilated indoor swimming pool increases the assimilation of these
harmful toxins, which can trigger EIB. According to the U.S. National Institute
for Occupational Safety and Health, chronic exposure to chloroform can also
damage the liver and kidneys.
Although adolescent swimmers train in the same environment as their elders
do, adolescents are at a greater risk for EIB because they inhale more air per unit
of body weight and have less-developed immune systems. Therefore, they absorb
a greater amount of toxins, primarily chloroform, during a training session. Mul-
tiple training sessions prevent the clearing of toxins because at least one night is
needed for absorbed substances to be removed from the body (Cammann and
Hubner 1995). For that reason, the onset of EIB in adolescent swimmers may
follow sudden increases in training volume or a transition to two-a-day practices.
Adolescent swimmers with symptoms of EIB should be evaluated by a doctor
to determine how serious their condition is and to initiate effective management
of the condition (Sinha and David 2003). Swimmers should be aware of the
nature of EIB, the triggers that are specific to their case, and the ways that they
can avoid or control bronchospasm without medication. One way to prevent
bronchial hyperresponsiveness during these acute attacks is to warm up properly
before performing vigorous exercise (Reiff et al. 1989). In addition, adolescents
should seek opportunities to train outdoors because the chloroform exposure
of outdoor pools is much less than that of indoor pools (Aiking et al. 1994).

Musculoskeletal Injuries
The muscles and tendons of the developing body are particularly fragile during
adolescence as they adapt to the maturing skeleton. Chapter 18 looks in depth
at orthopedic injuries in swimming, but this section deals specifically with
orthopedic issues in the developing athlete.
Shoulder pain is the most common musculoskeletal complaint among swim-
mers of all levels, so athletes, coaches, and parents need to understand how the
shoulder works. The shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint that has 180 degrees of
rotation. The humerus (the upper-arm bone) is the ball portion of the joint, and
the scapula is the socket. These bones are held together by the glenohumeral
capsular ligaments and the four rotator cuff muscles. Stability in this region is
important for maintaining a healthy ball-and-socket. The glenohumeral liga-
ments in the shoulder provide static stability, which holds the bones together.
The rotator cuff muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and sub-
scapularis) provide dynamic stability when the shoulder is in motion. Shoulder
stability depends on a combination of both dynamic and static stabilizers. This
stability can be compromised if muscle strength and endurance are inadequate
during the period of rapid skeletal growth.
When 993 10- to 18-year-old swimmers were evaluated, 47 percent reported
a history of pain in the shoulder, referred to as swimmer’s shoulder (McMaster
and Troup 1993). The term swimmer’s shoulder was first used in 1974 to describe
anterior shoulder pain felt by swimmers during and after training. It has since
become a nonspecific term referring to a variety of injuries that occur in the
shoulder region. Shoulder pain in swimmers is generally assumed to result from
subacromial impingement, whereby the rotator cuff tendons impinge against
the overlying acromion bone, which results in rotator cuff tendonitis. Tendonitis
is the inflammation of a tendon because of irritation. The tendons of the rota-
tor cuff muscles pass through a relatively narrow space between the acromion
process of the scapula and the head of the humerus, which can apply pressure
on these tendons if the space is constricted. In the case of swimmer’s shoulder,
the tendons of the rotator cuff and associated bursa often become inflamed
because of impingement caused by the repetitive overhead arm motion of the
freestyle stroke.
Impingement can occur during the pull-through phase or during the recovery
phase of freestyle. If a swimmer’s hand enters the water across the midline of
the body at the beginning of the pull-through phase (known as hand entry),
the shoulder is placed in a position of horizontal adduction, which results in
a mechanical impingement. Impingement can also occur during the recovery
phase of freestyle, which starts when the arm exits the water and ends with hand
entry. During this phase, fatigue often becomes evident as swimmers find it more
challenging to lift their arms out of the water with each stroke. Adolescent swim-
mers are more prone to fatigue during this phase when their muscles lack full
strength during maturation. In addition, swimmers with shoulder impingement

--- Page 470 Text ---
|
Adolescent Swimmers 459
have been shown to minimize their follow-through, eliminating the extreme
internal rotation by pulling their hands out of the water too early. This action
may be contributing to the impingement, or it may be a result of their subcon-
scious effort to minimize pain from the injury. All these stroke alterations result
in decreased efficiency of the rotator cuff muscles and mechanical impingement
of the supraspinatus tendon.
What predisposes adolescent swimmers to swimmer’s shoulder? Lax ligaments,
poor technique, and overtraining are the most common causes of swimmer’s
shoulder. Because of the nature of the sport, loose ligaments in the shoulder are
common among swimmers. Young swimmers who have naturally lax ligaments,
most commonly seen in those with underlying generalized ligamentous laxity,
are subject to loose shoulders that may slip out of their sockets because of a lack
of static stability. In this setting, the rotator cuff is overloaded because of reliance
on the dynamic stabilizers. If these athletes identify this condition early, they
can focus on strengthening the rotator cuff muscles, which will increase their
dynamic stability to compensate for the lack of static stability.
Poor technique can also lead to impingement over a short period because of
the repetitive nature of the sport and the increased likelihood of microtrauma
during growth and development. Crossing the hand over the midline on hand
entry, as discussed previously, and pointing the thumb down with the palm
facing outward are two common mistakes made, particularly by young swim-
mers who have not yet had extensive years of technique training.
Overtraining or underrecovery is another leading cause of swimmer’s shoul-
der. Swimmers in year-round youth swim programs average between 6,000 and
10,000 meters per day and practice five to seven days per week. Assuming that
their average stroke count is between 8 and 10 strokes per 25 meters, swimmers
are rotating each shoulder around 30,000 times per week. The muscles of a
growing body are more prone to fatigue than those of fully developed athletes,
which causes them to work less efficiently. The muscles are then forced to work
harder with less strength, and athletes will increase their stroke frequency in
an attempt to compensate. To minimize their chances of developing an over-
use injury, adolescent swimmers should avoid swimming seven days per week,
rapidly increasing their training volume, or specializing in a sport year round.
Studies have shown that strengthening the rotator cuff muscles, scapular
muscles, lower trapezius, and core muscles will significantly decrease an athlete’s
risk for developing swimmer’s shoulder (Faigenbaum et al. 2009).
Strength Training for Adolescent Swimmers
Despite the old misconception that youth strength training was unsafe and
ineffective, major health organizations such as the American College of Sports
Medicine (ACSM), the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and the National
Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) are now advocating appropriately
designed and properly supervised strength-training programs for adolescents.

--- Page 471 Text ---
}
460 Metzl and Busko
Strength training is now recognized as a vital component of youth athletic pro-
grams, injury prevention strategies, and long-term health promotion. As ado-
lescents become more active in sport and conditioning, accountability for their
cumulative workload is often lacking. Age-appropriate guidelines for strength
training have been established to reduce the risk of sports injuries and improve
athletic performance. Figure 21.2 presents guidelines for youth strength train-
ing; for additional information, see the NSCA position statement for youth
resistance training as well as the NATA position statement on the prevention
of pediatric overuse injuries (Faigenbaum et al. 2009; Valovich McLeod et al.
2011).
Strength training prevents poor conditioning and muscular imbalance, which
are two major causes of acute and overuse injuries. Well-designed strength-
training programs that include a combination of resistance training and plyo-
metrics have been proved to reduce sports-related injuries in adolescent athletes
(Valovich McLeod et al. 2011).
General Youth Resistance-Training Guidelines
w All strength-training sessions should be supervised by a quality instructor.
w Each training session should begin with a 5- to 10-minute warm-up or
dynamic warm-up and end with a cool-down session.
w Young athletes should use light loads or body weight as resistance. Loads
should increase gradually as the athlete becomes more proficient and stronger.
w All exercises should be performed with an emphasis on using proper technique.
w Injury prevention is key. Swimmers should focus on building strength in the
muscles of the shoulder and rotator cuff, upper back, and core.
w Muscle balance and full-body strengthening are also important, so athletes
should incorporate a mix of upper-body and lower-body exercises.
w Young athletes should not attempt to perform maximum lifts in any exercise.
Additionally, strength training is not a contest to see who can lift or do more.
w Proper recovery is key, so athletes should not strength-train the same muscle
groups on consecutive days. Performing two or three strength-training
sessions per week is appropriate.
w Low-level plyometric exercises (hopping, skipping, bounding) are appropriate
for young athletes.
w Progress should be monitored and evaluated regularly.
w Athletes should be encouraged to let the coach know if anything hurts or does
not feel right.
w Strength can be developed in the pool in various ways, such as fins, vertical
kicking, pulling, and so on.
w Remember that resistance training places stress on the body, so it should be
considered part of the athlete’s overall training volume.
w The athletes should have fun but should also bring maturity to strength
training for it to be safe and successful.

Strength training is the use of resistance to muscular contraction from light
weights or body weight designed to build strength, anaerobic endurance, and
the power of skeletal muscles. Strength training provides functional benefits for
athletes of all ages, but it is particularly beneficial during adolescence because
it improves bone density; increases the strength and resilience of muscles, ten-
dons, and ligaments; improves joint function; raises the level of good cholesterol
(HDL) in the body; improves cardiac function; triggers a temporary increase in
metabolism; and reduces the potential for injury.
Among the different forms of strength training are weight training, resistance
training, isometric training, and plyometrics. Weight training and resistance training
are similar in that they use gravity or elastic resistance to oppose muscle con-
traction. Elastic resistance provides the opportunity to increase strength while
also allowing athletes to expand their range of motion (Duchateau and Hainaut
1984). Isometric (or constant length) training differs in that the length of the
muscle and the joint angle remain constant during a contraction. Isometric train-
ing increases strength at the specific joint angles where the exercise is carried
out and, to a lesser extent, at additional joint angles, whereas dynamic training
increases strength through the muscle’s complete range of motion.
Note that strength training and power lifting are not the same. Strength train-
ing is repetitive lifting of light weights, designed to increase baseline strength by
developing more muscle fibers, whereas power lifting is heavy lifting designed
to maximize muscle mass. Power lifting, as well as heavy lifting of any kind,
is potentially dangerous to the open growth plates in adolescents, so it is not
recommended for young athletes.
Plyometric training is an alternative form of conditioning designed to improve
neuromuscular nervous system for the purpose of improving athletic perfor-
mance. Plyometrics generates fast, powerful movements through repeated load-
ing and contracting of the muscle, which increases the speed or force of muscular
contractions. Plyometric jump training creates ground reaction forces that are
four to seven times body weight, which provides benefits to the growing skel-
eton during adolescence (Whalen and Carter 1988). This aspect is of particular
importance for swimmers, who must seek opportunities outside their sport for
weight-bearing activity.
Dryland training is the term that swimmers use to refer to strength-training
exercises, which can include bodyweight exercises (calisthenics), stretch cords,
medicine balls, and machines. Consistent dryland workouts are the foundation
for success in the sport, particularly for adolescent swimmers. The muscles of
the core, back, and shoulders are of particular importance and should be the
focus of a strength-training program. Electromyographic stroke analysis has
demonstrated that the scapular muscles (serratus anterior, subscapularis, and
lower trapezius) are used continuously throughout the entire stroke. Therefore,
they are most susceptible to fatigue if they are not properly strengthened. When
fatigued, swimmers tend to compromise the upward rotation of the scapula,
which is a leading cause of shoulder impingement.

The following are some recommended dryland exercises for adolescent swim-
mers, designed for both improving performance in the water and preventing
injuries.
Plank The plank is an isometric exercise that builds endurance and strength in
the abdomen, back, shoulder, and stabilizer muscles. Prepare for planks by lying
face down and resting on the forearms. Push up off the floor, raising the body
on to the toes and elbows (figure 21.3). Keep the back flat so that it remains in
a straight line from head to heels. If the butt is sagging or sticking up in the air,
contract the abdominal muscles to maintain proper form. Hold for 60 seconds,
lower, and repeat.
 Figure 21.3 Plank position.
Side Plank The side plank strengthens the shoulder girdle, wrist and elbow
joints, abdomen, and back. Prepare for side plank by lying on your side. Lift your
body off the ground and balance on one forearm and the side of one foot (figure
21.4). Raise the opposite arm in the air as if you are reaching for the ceiling. Hold
for 60 seconds, switch sides, and repeat.

Stability Ball Reverse Fly Reverse flys work the muscles in the shoulders (rear
deltoids) and the upper back (trapezius and rhomboids). Prepare by lying face down
with the chest supported on a stability ball. Keep the feet wider than shoulder-
width apart to maintain stability. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with palms facing
each other. Start with dumbbells resting on the floor directly under the shoulders
(figure 21.5a). Bend the elbows slightly while lifting the dumbbells to shoulder
level and squeeze the shoulder blades together at the top of the movement (figure
21.5b). Slowly, with control, return to the starting position. Inhale on the way up
and begin exhaling at the top of the movement.

Goblet Squat This exercise improves
hip mobility and ankle dorsiflexion
while also building stability and overall
strength. Prepare by standing up straight
while holding a light medicine ball or
weight close to the chest. Squat down as
if sitting on a chair, without allowing the
knees to bend beyond the feet at any
time. At the bottom of the squat, pause
and use the elbows to push out the knees
(figure 21.6). Return to the starting posi-
tion and repeat. Keep the back straight
and the head up throughout the entire
exercise.

Russian Twist With a Medicine Ball Russian twists work all the muscles in
the abdomen. Prepare by sitting tall with the legs extended in front of the body
and the knees bent. Hold a medicine ball in both hands. Rotate the torso to the
left and bring the medicine ball to the ground near the left hip (figure 21.7). After
lightly tapping the ball to the ground but without resting it there, rotate the torso
to the right and tap the medicine ball to the ground near the right hip. Repeat
this rotation without pausing in the middle.

Push-Up Plus This exercise distinguishes itself from the standard push-up by
placing extra emphasis on the serratus anterior muscle, which is of particular
importance to swimmers. Strengthening the serratus anterior will reduce the risk
of shoulder injuries and improve posture. Prepare by assuming a push-up position.
Have the arms straight and place the hands slightly wider than shoulder-width
apart. Keep the body in a straight line from the head to the ankles. Lower the
body until the chest nearly touches the floor. Pause here for one second. Push
back up (figure 21.8a), but as the arms straighten, push the upper back toward
the ceiling (figure 21.8b) and pause for one or two seconds before lowering to
starting position. Repeat.

Summary
This chapter provided a comprehensive view of the adolescent swimmer. Coaches,
parents, and athletes who understand the health concerns specific to the adoles-
cent swimmer can take proper precautions to prevent injury and promote safety
in this population of athletes. Through a combination of adequate strength
training and appropriate training volume, adolescent swimmers can improve
year to year while remaining healthy and reducing the risk of injury.

CHAPTER
Masters Swimmers
—James W. Miller, MD
Swimming is an incredible sport that athletes of all ages can enjoy. The sport
carries with it some tremendous health benefits because it provides a mix of
aerobic and anaerobic conditioning that drives gains in fitness, motor control and
technique, and power production. Additionally, a well-designed aquatic fitness
program addresses a number of factors that are important to older athletes: the
low-impact nature of swimming, the ability of water to support aging joints, the
development of aerobic and anaerobic fitness, and a socially supportive environ-
ment that includes the opportunity for supervised, coached training sessions.
In short, swimming offers a unique experience to adults of all ages and ability,
whether a person wishes to engage in a fitness program or compete in organized
swim meets. For those looking to race, competitions are available worldwide.
These competitions may be conducted in a pool or open water, and they can
serve as a stimulus to motivate training or as a measurement of a person’s level
of training or conditioning.
Masters swimming does not come without its challenges. The competitive
nature of swimming requires a strong commitment from athletes at any level,
but the masters swimmer faces the added challenges of work, family, and
(unfortunately) aging. Despite these challenges, masters swimmers across the
country and around the world continue to improve their performances and use
swimming to fuel a healthy lifestyle. One thing that underlies any successful
masters swimming endeavor is consistency—training with regularity and doing
the things necessary to achieve health and performance goals.

Overview of Masters Swimming
Before diving headlong into a discussion of masters swimming and ways to maxi-
mize performance, we need to define several terms commonly used in the sport.
Defining Masters Swimming
Masters swimming is an internationally organized sport for athletes who are
25 years of age and older. Note that in the United States, the beginning age is
younger; athletes can start swimming in masters events at 18 years of age. The
difference in the United States comes in part from the university system and
the career paths available to swimmers. In the United States athletes typically
enter a college or university setting at 18 years of age. The age for participation
in masters was reduced to coincide with that age, allowing athletes to continue
their involvement as they transition from a high school program to either higher
education or work.
Masters swimming competitions are divided into 5-year increments. Com-
petitive age groups are established for ages 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, and so

on all the way up to 100 to 104 years of age. In the United States, an added age
group captures the 18- to 24-year-old swimmers. The approaches described here
underscore the main philosophy of masters swimming—the promotion of fit-
ness for life. The mission statement of United States Masters Swimming says it
best: “To promote health, wellness, fitness and competition for adults through
swimming.”
Defining the Competitive Athlete in Masters
Swimming
The term competitive athlete applies to all masters swimmers who engage in pool-
based competitions, open-water swims, or triathlons. The pool events available
to masters swimmers in competition typically include all the traditional strokes
and distances. Also available is a full array of open water distance events, which
are swum in lakes, rivers, bays, and beach environments. Triathlon events include
a range of distances, from sprint-distance triathlons all the way up to the Iron-
man and ultramarathon distance races.
Defining the Fitness Athlete in Masters Swimming
The term fitness athlete applies to anyone who swims and trains to maintain
health and fitness but not necessarily to compete in organized competitions.
When discussing the importance of swimming as a life habit, even the most
accomplished Olympic athlete lists fitness as a top reason for swim training.

Superficially, the differences between the competitive and fitness sides of the
masters swimming spectrum may seem significant, but the athletes themselves
perceive those differences to be small. Masters swimming is really all about fit-
ness for life. It is a culture that embraces the philosophy of fitness.
There is more to consider when exploring why adults train in swimming. Fitness
and love of the water are the obvious reasons for many. Physicians recommend
aquatic programs to address a wide range of medical problems, as discussed in
detail later. In addition, the social side of masters training is a fundamental draw
to many who participate in the sport. As in most sports, differences in social,
ethnic, and religious backgrounds disappear, and all participants enjoy a common
language and interest. Recent remarks at the US Masters Swimming National
Championships frequently included the desire to catch up with old friends and
meet new ones as a prime reason for attending the four-day competition.
Swimming Is Unique: The Healing Waters
Many aspects of swimming are unique among the types of exercise that adults
can pursue throughout their lives. The aquatic medium offers features for both
athletes and health care professionals who are attempting to motivate patients
(athletes) to adopt a healthier lifestyle.
First, water supports the body in a suspended state, which minimizes the
problems of balance and impact on the body. If a swimmer loses balance in the
pool, the consequences are few, whereas an athlete who falls while exercising on
land may face contusions, lacerations, or fractures that may result in considerable
time lost from activity and even loss of independence. People who have arthritic
joints may have difficulty on land, but they frequently enjoy much freer func-
tion when their joints do not have to bear body weight. Aquatic rehabilitation
of musculoskeletal injuries or following joint replacement is common. Aquatic
support decreases the impact of body weight on the joint, and the patient can
slowly progress back to land-based activity.
Second, temperature regulation is unique to water. In a well-controlled aquatic
environment, water temperature is tightly monitored to suit the needs of the
athlete. Water temperatures of 81 degrees Fahrenheit (27.2 Celsius) or less are
ideal for the heavy aerobic demands of competitive swimmers who are attempt-
ing to maximize their time in the pool with an aggressive program. This water
temperature allows athletes to maintain high levels of training without having
their core temperature rise. Consequently, they can more easily control their
heart rate. This aspect is important to those who have underlying blood pressure
and cardiac problems, as well as to pregnant athletes.
Differences in the size of the masters athlete also come into play when dis-
cussing temperature regulation. The greater an athlete’s surface area is relative to
weight, the easier it is for the athlete to dissipate heat. Following adolescence, the
ratio of surface area to weight tends to decrease, making heat buildup a greater
problem. Training at the correct water temperatures helps the masters athlete
keep core temperature and heart rate in a safe range. Temperatures closer to 88

degrees Fahrenheit (31 degrees Celsius) provide a warm environment conducive
to instruction and rehabilitation. Between these two temperature extremes is
a range for other aquatic activities, but at 83 degrees Fahrenheit (28.3 degrees
Celsius) and above, athletes who are steadily moving have increasing difficulty
controlling heart rate as core body temperature rises.
Third, exercising in the horizontal position is another unique aspect of swim-
ming. Being horizontal allows blood to be more equally distributed throughout
the lungs and optimizes oxygen delivery to the blood because there is no oxygen
blood inequity as exists in the upright position. To be clearer, when the body is
upright, more blood is in the bases of the lung than at the top. This situation is
equalized in the supine position. Skeletal stresses are more equally distributed
in this plane as well, because gravity is not a factor.
Fourth, humidity has long been thought to be an advantage for athletes
with asthma or other lung diseases. Humidity tends to improve the viscosity of
mucous secretions, making them much easier to handle. The reverse environ-
ment, which is notorious for being the worst for the pulmonary system, is cold,
dry air, which can induce an asthma attack in athletes who are prone to this risk.
Altitude magnifies the problems with cold, dry air. Although warm humidity is
advantageous for lungs, the by-products of chlorine, bromine, and other chemi-
cals may offset some of this advantage. Thus, the entire aquatic environment
has to be considered when assessing the benefits of humidity on the lungs. The
air-handling system of an indoor or outdoor aquatic complex, water temperature,
water chemical balance, and temperature differences between air and water all
contribute to the aquatic environment.
The bottom line is that the aquatic environment is a unique place to exer-
cise. The support for the body, humidity, and heat dissipation for training give
advantages to athletes of all ages.
Offsetting the Effects of Aging
As much as people would like to think that they can steal from Father Time,
evidence abounds to the contrary. The effect of aging is real, whether it is a
decrease in muscular strength or an increase in arthritic joint pain. Can we alter
the progression of aging through regular exercise such as swimming? In short,
the answer is yes, but we should examine what the research says about aging
and the effect of engaging regularly in swimming. In the process we will look
at these specific questions:
• What are the physical, physiological, and other benefits that can come from
being a part of a masters swimming program?
• How should an older athlete train to either maintain health or maximize
performance? Do the methods of training need to change compared with
what a younger athlete would do?
• Do masters athletes need to prepare differently or approach recovery from
a different perspective? Are the guidelines different?

 Masters swimming provides the opportunity for fitness to adults of all ages.
The preceding questions are a lot to consider. Obviously, it is not as simple as
saying to the enthusiastic new athlete, “Push off and let’s see how it goes.”
Aging people certainly deserve attention because they are the most rapidly
growing sector of the population. In 1990 there were 33 million people over
the age of 65. Those over the age of 85 were the most rapidly growing segment
of the population. The U.S. population grew by 11 percent in the 1990s, but the
number of people over 85 years old grew by 44 percent. If we fast-forward to the
projections of the U.S. Census Bureau, between 2000 and 2030 the population
of those 65 and over will grow by 204 percent in the United States. This growth
will likely translate into many masters swimmers who want to remain indepen-
dent and enjoy an active lifestyle. Coaches need to understand how to train this
group of people. Additionally, facilities and coaches need to be prepared for the
demands that will be placed on them in the coming years.
What Is Aging?
Researchers have various definitions of aging, from the cellular level to the organ
system level. Microscopically, a loss of cell water accompanies a fundamental
change to the cell’s DNA. Simply stated, wrinkled cells come from wrinkled
people. Whether from the loss of water or a change in the contents of the cells

themselves, a decline in the elasticity of the cellular fibers occurs throughout
the body with aging.
If we consider specific organ systems, which is a common way to look at the
phenomenon of aging, it is often beneficial to consider each one separately to
get the best picture of how the aging process affects the body. On average, we
can expect to lose approximately 10 percent of function per decade during the
normal aging process. Usually, this rate seems to accelerate at a certain age. The
target age at which the aging process seems to accelerate is system dependent, not
person dependent. Little research has been done about how aerobic or anaerobic
training affects the target age, but it is known that regular exercise, and swim-
ming in particular, can delay or considerably slow the aging process overall.
Organ Systems and the Benefits
of Aquatic Fitness
We have seen masters swimmers stay actively engaged in the sport well into
their 80s and 90s and even 100s. So, what occurs, system by system, when the
human body ages (see table 22.1), and how can swimming affect this process?
The overall effect of a vigorous exercise program on the body are far reaching
indeed. In a study conducted by the Cooper Clinic, Steven Blare followed 40,547
adults between the ages of 20 and 70 over a 13-year period, looking at all causes
of mortality. He broke the group into categories based on the activities (or lack
thereof) in which the individuals participated. The study participants were clas-
sified as sedentary (15,883), runners (3,746), walkers (20,356), or swimmers
(562). The observations and the subsequent conclusions that were drawn from
this study were surprising, especially the finding that the mortality rates over
those 13 years were 11 percent for the sedentary people, 7.8 percent for walkers,
6.6 percent for runners, and 1.9 percent for swimmers (Whitten 2010). Why is
this the case?
Let’s look at how masters swimmers train. Masters athletes typically exercise
year round and engage in three or more pool or open water practices per week,
all of which is considered vigorous exercise. This type of activity exceeds the
recommendations put forward by the American College of Sports Medicine
(ACSM) and U.S. government studies. Historically, the benefits derived from
exercise were demonstrated in 1970 when evidence was found linking vigorous
.
physical exercise to improvement in maximal aerobic power (VOmax). In 1978
2
ACSM defined vigorous exercise as 60 to 90 percent of maximum predicted
heart rate (American College of Sports Medicine 1978). Data collected between
1985 and 2000 further substantiated the effect that moderate exercise has on
cardiovascular disease risk factors and all causes of cardiac mortality. At that
time, the recommendation that people engage in 30 minutes of moderate exer-
cise was promoted (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 1996). In
2002 the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine countered that
advice by increasing the exercise recommendation to 60 minutes, though still

at a moderate level (Institute of Medicine of the National Academies of Science
2002). In 2008 the activity recommendation changed to an expectation of 150
minutes of moderate activity per week or 75 minutes of vigorous activity per
week based on research of a scientific council (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services 2008). Masters swimming includes a greater amount of vigorous
activity per week than the average person will get from other sports.
Cardiovascular System
When considering the effect that this type of activity has on organ systems, the
cardiac system is a good place to start because it is central to providing oxygen
and nutrients to the muscles, brain, and other structures of the training athlete.
Cardiac and vascular diseases are rapidly on the rise in the United States popula-
tion. The normal aging process typically results in a decrease in cardiac output
(the amount of blood pumped by the heart in a given period), which in turn is
affected by heart rate and the volume of the heart. Obviously, the heart has to
work harder if the vessels that it is pushing blood into are stiffer. This condition,
known as peripheral resistance, increases with aging. The vessels become stiffer
either from lipid deposits within the vessel wall or simply because of loss of
elasticity of the fibers within the wall. The magic age of decline for the cardio-
vascular system is usually cited as 60 years of age for men and women, although
the starting age is cited as 25 years of age. Does exercise modify this process?
Absolutely it does, which supports the observations from the Cooper Clinic.
The cardiovascular system is frequently implicated in a decline in a person’s
aerobic performance. Three components contribute to aerobic capacity (Tanaka
and Seals 2008). The first is exercise economy, which is the efficiency by which
an athlete can transfer raw metabolic power to mechanical power, in this case
muscular force that can be used to propel the swimmer down the pool. Research
has shown that exercise economy typically does not change with age.
The second component to cardiovascular performance is the exercise intensity
at which a high fraction of maximum oxygen consumption can be maintained.
This point is more commonly referred to as the lactate threshold. A person’s lactate
threshold may change with aging, but the change is typically not dramatic, and
the aerobically training athlete can maintain endurance performance (Robinson
et al. 1976; Maffulli, Testa, and Capasso 1994; Evans et al. 1995).
The third component to aerobic performance is maximum oxygen consump-
.
tion, or VOmax, which does seem to show evidence of age-related decline, even
2 .
in the aerobically training athlete. Multiple factors go into determining VOmax,
2
including cardiac output, vessel elasticity, and pulmonary factors. Certainly,
aerobic fitness reduces the predicted cardiovascular decline substantially (at
least by half) if training is maintained. Limiting the time lost from training and
maintaining a consistently high level of training seem to have an effect here
(Mountjoy et al. 2010). Consistency matters!
Other issues faced by aging athletes and involving the cardiovascular system
include cardiac arrhythmias, the most common of which is atrial fibrillation.

--- Page 487 Text ---
}
476 Miller
Atrial fibrillation is a condition in which the top chambers of the heart (the atria)
lose their regular beating pattern and take on an irregular contraction that does
not pump blood effectively. The risk of atrial fibrillation is that cardiac output can
decline by more than 10 percent, putting the person at risk for the development of
blood clots in the heart, which can break off and travel anywhere in the body. This
condition leads to the need for anticoagulation therapy, which frequently is lifelong,
or cardiac ablation surgery to correct the arrhythmia. The incidence of atrial fibril-
lation is inversely proportionate to the exercise that the person is performing on a
regular basis. In one study, those who walked 11 blocks weekly had a 22 percent
reduction in risk for developing it, whereas walking 60 blocks per week resulted in
a 44 percent reduction (Mozaffarian et al. 2008). A fit pump outperforms an unfit
one in many ways, and masters swimming can help keep the heart and vascular
system healthy. Recent data, however, indicate that as the intensity of the exercise
increases with duration, the cardiovascular system undergoes several changes
that may actually increase the incidence of atrial fibrillation. Prolonged extremely
intense exercise may result in left atrial dilation or remodeling, persistent vagotonia,
sympathetic surges, intermittent left atrial hypertension, or chronic inflammation
when combined with genetic predisposition, alcohol, caffeine, or psychological
stress (Sorokin et al. 2011; Pelliccia et al. 2005). So, people can have too much of
a good thing, particularly in the setting of comorbid predispositions.
The forms of exercise that address these cardiovascular changes, whether
cardiac output or cardiac arrhythmias, are primarily aerobic in nature, but the
addition of resistance training is beneficial. Swimming has some resistance train-
ing built into it, because of the water medium through which athletes propel
themselves. But the best of both worlds is found in a comprehensive training
program that combines resistance training, such as weightlifting, with a swim-
ming program. Resistance training has been shown to decrease blood pressure,
decrease heart rate, and improve left ventricular function (a prime component
of cardiac output to the system).
Blood vessel elasticity is a prime component of peripheral resistance. The jury
is out about whether aerobic training can affect the change in the elastic compo-
nents of the vessel wall. But a major factor in loss of elasticity is the deposition
of lipids in the vessel walls. All cardiac sources point to the problems that most
Western societies have with a rise in total cholesterol and triglycerides, which
corresponds with the rise in the incidence of obesity, sedentary lifestyle, and
insulin resistance. Aerobic training stimulates the production of HDL cholesterol
if it is performed up to 40 minutes per day, five days per week. It also stimulates
metabolic rate and lowers LDL and VLDL cholesterols. So, whether the deposi-
tion of lipids in vessel walls is slowed, stopped, or even reversed, it clearly has
an effect on vessel wall stiffness and peripheral resistance.
Musculoskeletal System
The musculoskeletal system is critical to the performance of the masters athlete.
Aging brings a decline in the elasticity of the musculoskeletal components.

Sarcopenia refers to the loss of muscle fibers, which are replaced by fibrous
tissue and fat. Neither of the replacement cellular types is metabolically as active
as muscle fiber. The result of this conversion from active to inactive tissue is a
decline in metabolic rate. The effect continues on to broader topics of lessening
glucose tolerance, which sets up a state conducive to the expression of diabetes,
if that tendency is present. But the data about musculoskeletal decline is gener-
ally based on healthy sedentary adults, not masters swimmers (Tanaka et al.
1997, 2000; Tanaka, Monahan, and Seals 2001; Tanaka and Seals 1997, 2003).
From a functional standpoint, musculoskeletal decline results in a decrease
in contractile force and rate, meaning that the athlete cannot achieve the same
power production and will have difficulty achieving maximum force as quickly
as in the past. Microscopically, a change occurs in the ratio of Type II (fast-twitch)
fibers to Type I (slow-twitch) fibers from 1:1 to 1:2. A change occurs not only in
the number of Type II fibers but also in their cross-sectional dimensions.
The cause of Type II fiber loss is multifactorial, but the first factor listed by all
experts is disuse. Disuse contributes to Type II fiber loss, in both volume and
number, across studies. The age of onset is somewhat later than that noted for the
cardiovascular system, beginning at 35 years of age, and the rate of loss is 1.25
percent per year. The acceleration age is 70 years old. The gender of the athlete
does not change the observations. Without disuse, when exercise is moderate,
the rate of decline is half that quoted, at least. But the vigorously training athlete
 A swimmer who trains vigorously can slow the muscle decline that comes with age.

is again a different model (Coggan et al. 1990). With these athletes, little or no
change occurs in fiber type or cross-sectional area, giving the dedicated masters
athlete a strong edge in avoiding the considerable consequences of declining
metabolism (Trappe et al. 1995). This finding represents a huge change from
prior impressions. Dedication matters!
Balance
Closely related to the musculoskeletal system are problems associated with bal-
ance and falling. Swimming is an ideal lifelong program of exercise for avoiding
or delaying balance issues. Falling and balance are affected by a combination of
being weaker and having poor muscle feedback (Salzman 2010). Exercising to
maintain muscle mass, reactivity, and proprioception can delay this process by
at least a decade, providing a tremendous bonus to the aging athlete by allowing
more continuous training and reducing the training time lost to injuries. Swim-
ming works on the coordination of muscle firing and performance and aids in
the prevention of problems with those functions (Gillespie et al. 2009). Most
programs designed to address balance deficits emphasize land-based activity,
but swimming certainly assists in the strengthening and coordination that will
augment a land-based program.
Joint Health
Rheumatological diseases are most commonly expressed in older athletes.
Although rheumatoid arthritis, gout, psoriatic arthritis, and many other types
of arthritis require specific therapies, one of the most common types of arthritis
in older athletes is osteoarthritis.
Osteoarthritis is a degenerative process involving cartilage. It is not an inflam-
matory arthritis, but the joint destruction and pain are no less incapacitating.
Heredity is always a factor, but the patient’s history of performing little impact-
related exercise combined with poor aerobic fitness and an elevated weight or
body mass index (BMI) all combine to increase the risk of osteoarthritis. Clearly,
excellent aerobic fitness and strength training offset the limitations of osteoarthri-
tis but only as long as the program is maintained (Hart et al. 2008). Swimming
is uniquely kind to athletes who have osteoarthritis, although swimming stroke
modifications may be necessary for the athlete to enjoy the full benefits of training.
Sleep
Sleep and sleep quality are also affected by aging. The normal circadian rhythm
changes as a person gets older. Typically, the amount of time spent in deep,
restorative sleep declines, and the REM, or dreaming, phase becomes shallower,
which results in frequent nighttime awakening.
Several factors seem to have an effect on sleep, which obviously affects quality
of life as well as level of alertness. With age the body tends to decrease its pro-
duction of melatonin, which is the brain chemical that mediates sleep. Aerobic

training helps normalize sleep patterns, although it is not clear whether it has
a direct effect on melatonin levels. Clarity of thought, coordination, and focus
are all affected by quality of sleep, which in turn is affected by aerobic training.
Healing
Finally, a general topic for all systems is recovery, healing, and reserve. Aging has
a significant effect on the ability of any organ system to respond to a challenge,
such as a simple laceration, surgery, or an illness. Every response is slower and
has to be factored in when planning training. Although an athlete may have
recovered within a month from a specific surgery two decades ago, a month may
not be sufficient for the same recovery now. Older people should plan for that
and be pleasantly surprised if recovery is quicker than expected.
Physical Activity and Effects on Aging
Many studies link a sedentary lifestyle to poor health. Cross-sectional studies
link screen time, including television viewing and computer use, to obesity,
insulin resistance, and diabetes (Owen et al. 2010). These findings should not
be surprising because sedentary people will not maintain muscle mass and
their basal metabolic rate will decline because they are not doing any aerobic
training. Even if the data are adjusted for waist-to-chest ratios and exercise levels
(moderate versus vigorous), the results remain the same.
Lack of exercise contributes to a long list of diseases, many associated with
aging. The list includes risk of early death, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, dys-
lipidemia, colon cancer, and breast cancer. Although exercise is recommended to
forestall these diseases, a question remains about the importance of ideal BMI
as an independent factor (Lee et al. 2010).
Musculoskeletal Challenges for
the Active Masters Swimmer
Given the effects that exercise can have on the aging process, we know that the
masters swimmer benefits by participation in the sport. But what adjustments
need to be made for the masters athlete?
Clearly, the aging process stresses the musculoskeletal system. Elasticity
declines, healing capacity and response to injury decline, articular cartilage is
unable to repair itself, and repetitive motions can create imbalances and unique
stresses. In addition, the supply of oxygen and nutrients involving the cardio-
vascular and pulmonary systems tends to decline. Creative methods of training
must consider these variables, allowing for appropriate recovery, maintenance of
stroke technique, and stimulation of an adaptive training response in the setting
of decreased reparative capacity. Specific musculoskeletal injuries are worthy of
consideration because of their prevalence.

Rotator Cuff Tenosynovitis, Bursitis, or Tear
The shoulder is the most injured joint in swimming, both for competitive (Mount-
joy et al. 2010) and recreational athletes. The masters athlete has a greater risk of
overuse degenerative changes related to the cuff, which can include a fraying of
the cuff or an overuse tear. Standard studies of rotator cuff problems in swim-
mers are directed to age-group, college, and elite athletes who usually have been
pursuing their sport for 10 to 20 years. The masters swimmer has performed mil-
lions of rotations over a long training career. The clinical presentation therefore
tends to be different for the masters athlete, more often involving a degenerative
cuff than the classic acute tear in a healthy joint. The typical presentation in the
masters swimmers is consistent with chronic bursitis or tendonitis (tenosynovitis,
tendonopathy) followed by a worsening of the symptoms that extends beyond
workouts and interferes with sleep. Overhead motions in a flexed position are
usually uncomfortable to the athlete, and the combination of complaints leads
to a trip to a medical practitioner. Preventative exercises, although important
for all swimmers, are particularly relevant for the masters swimmer in helping
to maintain strength, address muscular imbalances, and promote the flexibility
needed to ensure healthy joints.
After an injury has occurred, the options for therapy are numerous. Regard-
less of the imaging process used to achieve an accurate diagnosis, not all full-
thickness tears need a surgical approach, but some partial-thickness tears do need
surgical attention. The management strategy is based on the athlete’s response
to conservative approaches of core strengthening, scapular strengthening, and
linking to the extremity. Primary strengthening of the cuff is critical for success,
whether surgery is needed or not, and attention to stroke technique is important
when the athlete is released to return to the pool. Although injections into the
subacromial bursa may give some temporary relief, multiple injections may
weaken the tendonous units, and they have not been found to improve the long-
term outlook. NSAID medications can assist temporarily but are poor options
for a long-term approach.
Joint Surgery or Replacement
Joint replacements can occur at any age, but they often occur among those of
masters swimming age. Knees and hips are the most commonly replaced joints,
and swimming is one of the best methods of rehabilitation. As with most situa-
tions, the better the muscle tone is around the joint, the easier the recovery will
be when the replacement takes place. Thus, someone who swims regularly and
is facing joint replacement will benefit from intensifying training in anticipation
of the surgery. Intensifying training improves muscle tone, aerobic condition-
ing, cardiac fitness, weight control (or promotes loss if that is an issue), blood
pressure control, and many other variables. The outcome of less disability and
an earlier return to work and activities can be impressive. More commonly, an
athlete comes into a masters swimming program following joint surgery after

--- Page 492 Text ---
|
Masters Swimmers 481
being barred from participating in another primary sport, usually running.
Going through the learning phases of swimming is more challenging while
compensating for the postsurgical joint, replacement or otherwise.
Spinal Stenosis
Spinal stenosis is also more common with aging. It literally means a narrowing
of the spinal canal regardless of cause, although most result from cumulative
degenerative changes. Bulging discs (herniated or weakened), thickening of the
ligament structures, mass effect (cyst or tumor), and slipping of one vertebra on
another (spondylolisthesis) are just several of the causes of spinal stenosis. The
neural unit that is under pressure will cause pain in tissues innervated by that
nerve and possibly muscle atrophy. Water is frequently the only place that the
athlete can find relief. The coach must pay strict attention to spinal alignment on
the long-axis strokes (freestyle and backstroke) and efficient rolling through the
water. Correct stroke technique reinforces the linking and conditioning of the
core muscles that in turn support the spine. The coach must also realize that the
short-axis strokes (butterfly and breaststroke) may not be possible at all because
both have a flexion and extension phase that involves the lumbar spine. Water
is frequently the salvation for the athlete who has spinal stenosis, buying time
for conservative therapies to take effect if surgery is being delayed or avoided
completely. Even easy training will work miracles on the athlete’s outlook and
coping ability through a frequently long rehabilitation.
Although other musculoskeletal and rheumatological problems are common
in the masters athlete, the important focus in many cases is not speed but main-
taining independence and aerobic fitness. Few remedies help the athlete who is
coping with these physical challenges better than maintaining aerobic fitness
and muscle tone in a supportive aquatic environment.
Medications
The listing of the prevalence of disease processes that the aging athlete may be
facing brings with it another topic—medications. Medications need to be consid-
ered in two major divisions, acute and chronic. When dealing with medication
and the masters athlete, the purpose of the medication should be considered.
For instance, beta-blockers are common medications used in cardiac medicine
to regulate heart rate and blood pressure. Therefore, the athlete who takes this
type of medication will not be able to achieve a heart rate or level of exertion that
would otherwise be expected. Thus, the anaerobic events (short sprints) will be
difficult or impossible to perform. Long aerobic distances will fit in much better.
Second, medical practitioners need to be able to look at the effect that a medica-
tion may have on athletic performance and training. Many medications compete
with the enzyme systems inside the muscle fiber that are involved in refueling
the muscle contractile units. The muscle will thus not have the fuel needed to
perform. The result will be a quick decline in performance as well as sore muscles.

 Masters swimmers vary in their ability and competitive experience.
Two options are available to the athlete. The athlete can be more careful with
diet by consuming simple carbohydrate while training to feed the muscle during
exercise. In addition to improving the diet, which is always a good option, the
athlete needs to consult with the prescribing medical practitioner to see whether
an alternative medication would not have the same side effect.
Side effects of medications are typically worst right after the medication
is started. Although long-term problems can build up over time the longer a
medication is taken, this effect is less common. Therefore, a new medication
would likely have a bigger effect on training performance. If a medication will
be taken for a brief period for a limited purpose, the athlete may experience
only a temporary decline in training. But if a medication is started long term
for a chronic condition, the athlete needs to understand how to work around
the challenges that the medication may present.
Training the Masters Athlete
Athlete safety is an important place to begin when designing training for the
masters athlete. The preceding discussions clearly suggest that developing a fully
integrated plan of training is more complex with adults than it is with younger
swimmers. A fully integrated program has to take into account training history,
which will set the expectations of the athlete for current performances, reasonable
or not. The goals of the new masters athlete are equally important to defining
a program that will meet the athlete’s expectations. The athletic history comes
into play here. The medical history is important regarding both past and ongoing

medical problems and medications, but the coach should not delve into medical
issues unless the athlete has functional problems.
A good preparticipation physical examination is recommended for any athlete
starting a masters swimming program. The influence of history, current health,
and medications can make the decision to pursue a masters program complex,
but this consideration is needed to ascertain whether a swimming program is
safe for the athlete without further testing or adjustments in medication (Elsawy
and Higgins 2010). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2008
stated that exercise is safe for those who do not have an underlying medical
condition or symptoms suggestive of an underlying condition that has not been
evaluated (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 2008). The American
College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association in 2002 suggested
that a physician’s consultation is wise for men over age 45 and women over age
55 if the exercise being proposed is vigorous (Gibbons et al. 2002). Swimming
is clearly defined as a vigorous form of exercise by their standards.
Constructing a Program
After the basics of safety and goal setting are taken care of, the training program
can be created. A number of resources provide workout sets and predesigned
workouts. Any coach or swimmer can use these examples to help construct a
masters swimming program, and this chapter will not re-create that pool of
information. Training programs for masters coaches provide certifications for
various levels of expertise through United States Masters Swimming. Each level
provides enhanced coaching education, which in turn benefits athletes in pro-
grams lucky enough to have these motivated coaches.
Nevertheless, this section discusses how a training session should be designed
and what it should focus on. This process can be a challenge because adults can
come from highly variable backgrounds; some are beginning swimmers who
have just finished a program that introduced them to water, others have many
years of competitive experience.
As in all levels of sport, the process has to start with teaching. Teaching the
most up-to-date concepts of stroke dynamics is more appreciated by masters
swimmers than any other group. This aspect is particularly rewarding to the
coach. By mixing in some distance training while teaching drills, the coach can
give the athlete a sense of accomplishment. Fins and other devices may be neces-
sary to accomplish this goal. Because each athlete has a different base, some will
graduate to advanced lanes more quickly than others, but the coach has to be
flexible. If she is not, the highly developed athlete will experience frustration by
being held back. If the initial instruction emphasizes the importance of stroke
technique for speed, efficiency, and reduction of injuries, the athlete can easily
be convinced of its importance.
Design of swimming sets requires creativity. The high-yardage repetitive
sets seen in many age-group programs are less desirable for masters swimmers
because the stresses incurred during the practice become repetitive. Overuse

(repetitive) injuries can be more common with masters swimmers in part because
of susceptibility, size, forces, and efficiency. Susceptibility is a term worthy of
definition here. The joints are older and probably have areas of degenerative
changes, and the blood supply and healing capacity are not as good as they are
in younger athletes. Both of these variables make the joints more susceptible
to overuse injury.
So to get specific, imagine a freestyle-dominated practice that totals 4,100
meters. The component groupings are simple and common:
Warm-up: 1,200 meters
Main set: 1,500 meters
Secondary set: 800 meters
Wrap-up set: 600 meters
How does the coach put this together for masters, keeping in mind the unique
physiology of the athlete? The simple answer is to break it up and keep it fun.
Fun, fitness, competition, and success are not mutually exclusive. The athlete
can have it all. But putting together a warm-up set, 30 × 100 freestyle, and some
cool-down does not accomplish all these objectives.
Warm-Up: 1,200 Meters
A number of features must be considered in constructing a warm-up. For example,
older athletes are usually stiffer and need to have their heart rates brought up
more slowly. The warm-up is an excellent time to combine physical preparation
for the workout with instruction. Adults like to learn, so the coach can introduce
a topic for the day, which is often technique based, in the warm-up. The coach
can teach at every practice and incorporate drills when appropriate.
For example, if the lesson for the day is swimming long and efficiently, the
drill to be taught (from among hundreds to choose from) could be any drill that
uses a delayed pull until the recovery hand just touches the water. This can be a
counted delay drill or a different type to teach the point of moving the recovery
arm before moving the pulling arm. Here is the plan:
400 meters easy to loosen up; swimmer’s choice of stroke or drills.
4 × 100 meters kicking on back, alternating dolphin and flutter kicks; fire
the core to create power and bring in some leg conditioning; fins may be
required by some swimmers to complete this set.
8 × 50 meters on an easy interval; on odd 50s, alternate the drill of the day
with easy swimming using the principles of the drill; on even 50s, descend
by 50 either by time, holding the interval unchanged, or by descending
the interval by five seconds for each of the even 50s (swim each one faster
than the previous one). This sequence focuses the athlete on using the drill
of the day for faster swimming (the last 50 is the fastest one). The coach
must emphasize the importance of the technique of the day as the athlete
builds to faster swimming.

Main Set: 1,500 Meters
The main set is the longest set of the day. It allows the athlete to build the aero-
bic base while not losing focus on improved stroke technique. Of course, the
tendency is to revert to the old comfortable (but incorrect) stroke. The coach
faces a challenge in putting the set together to allow reinforcement of technique
while building the aerobic base, which usually means performing short intervals.
5 × 100 meters descending by five seconds per 100 on either a fixed, descend-
ing, or ascending interval, depending on the coach’s emphasis.
2 × 50 meters of drill 25 and swim 25 on an easy interval; recovery with
emphasis on the earlier drill focus of the day’s workout helps to maintain
technique while extending the education aspect into the main set.
4 × 100 meters descending by five seconds per 100, starting at the second
interval from the first task (i.e., dropping only the first or slowest 100).
2 × 50 meters of drill 25 and swim 25 on an easy interval; recovery with
emphasis on the earlier drill focus of the day’s workout helps to maintain
technique while extending the education aspect into the main set.
3 × 100 meters descending by five seconds per 100, starting at the third interval
from the original set (i.e., dropping the two slowest 100s).
2 × 50 meters of drill 25 and swim 25 on an easy interval; recovery with
emphasis on the earlier drill focus of the day’s workout helps to maintain
technique while extending the education aspect into the main set.
Secondary Set: 800 Meters
The secondary set allows the athlete to continue to build the aerobic base but
in a fashion that changes the repetitive nature of the set and provides joint and
muscle recovery. The swimmer can use fins and other training devices, such as
paddles or kickboards. The fins and other devices change the forces somewhat
and add interest to the practice. Here is the plan:
75 meters kick, swim, kick on a tight interval.
50 meters swim fast using the principles of the day’s educational topic; same
interval as the 75, which will give plenty of rest.
Repeat six times with an easy 50 meters at the end.
Wrap-Up Set: 600 Meters
This final set can be the most important of the day. It is not junk distance tacked
on to the practice and labeled as an easy cool-down. In fact, the term cool-down
is not used. This set solidifies the teaching point of the day while slowly bringing
down the heart rate in an active recovery mode. Here is the plan:
4 × 50 meters descending numbers 1 to 3, with the last one easy; each 50 is faster than
the previous one, and the interval should allow no more than 10 seconds of rest.

1 × 100 meters alternating the drill of the day for 25 meters and 25 meters
of swimming.
4 × 50 meters ascending numbers 1 to 3, with the last one easy; each 50 is
swum slower than the previous one, and the interval allows 10 seconds
more rest than the previous interval.
1 × 100 meters alternating the drill of the day for 25 meters and 25 meters
of swimming.
The workout uses the physiological goals of training the masters athlete,
regardless of age or ability. Learning is a key along with a mix of aerobic and
anaerobic and power components. Intervals will change based on the swim-
mer’s ability and level of conditioning. Athletes should be encouraged to train
at a level that is challenging but possible. Learning sets are always at a learning
pace, not a training pace.
Optimizing Training for Masters
After the training program is in place, additional points need to be considered
to help masters get the most out of their training while taking into account the
unique physical needs of the adult athlete. Proper hydration of all athletes is
critical to performance, but this is more difficult to attain in masters athletes
because of the natural decline that occurs in thirst sensation with aging. Coaches
need to teach simple methods for monitoring hydration, such as looking at urine
color to determine the hydration state, and make sure that hydration is part of
every practice.
Aside from hydration, nothing enhances performance and recovery from
training like balanced nutrition. Chapter 14 is dedicated to nutrition, and the
keys identified there for the high-performance swimmer are applicable as well
to masters swimmers. An ideal nutritional plan is to consume a balance of all
food groups, pay strict attention to carbohydrate replenishment within 20 to
30 minutes of ending an exercise set, and follow that with a high-quality meal
that deemphasizes fats. Balance is key. Because the masters athlete has fewer
reserves in the musculoskeletal system, nutrition is more important to main-
taining muscle performance.
Strength and flexibility are clearly areas that are difficult to regain completely
after they are lost, but athletes of all ages benefit from a well-designed program.
Flexibility and strength programs specific to swimmers should focus on stabi-
lization of joints. Stabilization of the shoulder is key, allowing linkage to the
core through the scapula to produce power. Strength training should focus on
efficient power production by using core strength linked to the arms and legs.
This process results in surprising force production and swimming performances.
Technique, along with recognizing and overcoming innate weaknesses, is even
more important than it is in younger athletes. Flexibility programs should be
individualized because each athlete has unique areas of stability and instability.

Without evaluation by a trained professional such as a trainer, coach, or physi-
cal therapist, the athlete may destabilize areas of existing hyperflexibility while
ignoring areas of the body that are tighter. A well-designed flexibility program
is different for every athlete.
Remember that this all results in maintaining muscle mass, power, and the
fiber type percentage needed for enhanced performances, either in the pool or
in activities of daily living.
Summary
The masters athlete is complex, not simply an older age-group swimmer returning
to the past. The health risks and benefits are critical and require understanding
by the coach, athlete, and medical practitioner. Some athletes should receive a
medical evaluation before they begin a program, particularly if risk factors are
known or suspected. The coach has to treat every athlete differently depend-
ing on swimming history as well as goals the athlete may have set, realistic or
not. The benefits of a well-balanced masters program are substantial. Research
indicates that remarkable delays in aging can result from this type of physical
activity. Masters coach certification programs reinforce the unique challenges and
rewards of working with the aging athlete. Today, masters are achieving incredible
swimming performances that are difficult to believe possible, regardless of age.

CHAPTER
Female Swimmers
—Jaci L. VanHeest, PhD
The number of girls and women participating in the sport of swimming has
grown over the past decade. At the same time, the performances of female
athletes have continued to improve across all levels of competition.
Coaches are often tempted to treat and train male and female athletes alike, in
and out of the water, but to maximize performance of all athletes, coaches need
to know some key gender differences. A number of topics relate to elite female
performance, ranging from designing specific training strategies to providing
adequate nutritional support to identifying and addressing clinical issues specific
to female athletes. Researchers continue to evaluate and study the various fac-
tors that affect performance in the female athlete. Even more important, these
researchers and practitioners also look to optimizing the long-term health of
the female athlete.
This chapter looks specifically at the female athlete and presents information
important to the coach who is looking to optimize performance while main-
taining health in this group of athletes. This chapter, while presenting a general
overview of what makes female swimmers different from the males they may be
training with, also focuses on three main topics of debate that relate specifically
to the health and performance of the female swimmer:
1. The influence of energy status on sport performance
2. The role of iron status in performance
3. The influence of oral contraceptive use on performance
Coaches, parents, and athletes need to understand each of these issues because
all are critical to the optimization of training for competitive female athletes.

Energetics and Performance
Other chapters in this book have described how food fuels performance,
whether training or competition, and how proper nutrition is a must to maxi-
mize health and performance. Most people try to find the quick and easy way
to solve a problem, and swimmers are no different, especially when it comes to
nutrition. All swimmers, and female swimmers in particular, face a constant
barrage from myriad media influences touting the benefits of a whole host
of supplements and diet regimens that will enhance performance and help
achieve a certain body image. Coaches and athletes struggle to determine the
best methods for fueling the body and achieving a desired body composition
while at the same time optimizing performance.
Although chapter 14 outlines in detail how a swimmer should eat and
drink to prepare the body for the demands of swimming, a useful restatement
here is that the research supports the approach that a diet that is composed
predominantly of complex carbohydrate, is relatively low in fat, and contains
ample protein will optimize performance in swimmers (Deutz et al., 2000;
Hawley and Burke, 1997).
The relationship between energy expenditure (the calories burned in
training and activities of daily living) and energy intake (diet or calories
consumed) dictates, in large part, the athlete’s body weight and overall body
composition (distribution and relative amounts of body fat and lean muscle
mass). When intake equals expenditure, body weight remains stable. Body
weight declines when expenditure outstrips intake, and weight accrues when
intake is larger than expenditure (Melby and Hickey 2005). The basic energy
equation states the following:
• If energy intake equals energy expenditure, body weight is maintained.
• If energy intake is greater than energy expenditure, an athlete gains
weight.
• If energy intake is less than energy expenditure, an athlete loses weight.
These equations are important for the female-specific topics discussed in
this chapter that are related to the concept of energy balance. Female athletes
often reduce daily caloric consumption for a wide range of reasons (e.g., body
image, thinking that thinner equals better performance, and so on), resulting
in an overall energy deficit (VanHeest 1996; VanHeest et al. 2014; VanHeest
and Mahoney 2007). A prolonged deficit can have long-term implications for
both health and performance. Much of the research in this area to date focuses
on the energy requirements for the female athlete. Coaches and athletes need
to consider not only the total daily calorie needs but also the relationship
between energy balance (intake versus expenditure) and body composition.
How much energy is expended by a competitive female swimmer? Knowing
this quantity would be useful because it would drive the swimmer’s energy

consumption needs. Highly trained female swimmers have been reported to
expend between 3,000 and 4,500 kilocalories per day during heavy training
and between 2,000 and 4,000 kilocalories per day during taper (VanHeest
1996). A study by VanHeest confirmed energy expenditure (EE) data previ-
ously reported by Troup (1990) in high-school-aged swimmers. Start-of-season
EE reached approximately 3,300 kilocalories per day, midseason training
expenditures approached approximately 3,800 kilocalories per day, pretaper
EE was about 3,600 kilocalories per day, and end-of-season EE dropped to
approximately 2,800 kilocalories per day. Recently, EE was reported to be
approximately 2,350 kilocalories per day in collegiate swimmers during taper,
supporting previous work (Ousley-Pahnke, Black, and Gretebeck 2001).
Additional research confirms these findings and has shown that energy
expenditure varies throughout the season for female swimmers. As one
example, Kabasakalis and colleagues (2007) reported dietary intakes (EI) in
female Greek swimmers using three-day dietary records over the course of a
season. The swimmers consumed on average 2,359.8 kilocalories per day; 46
percent came from carbohydrate (4.4 grams per kilogram of body mass), 36
percent from fat, and approximately 18 percent from protein (1.7 grams per
kilogram of body mass). The women did not seem to alter their dietary intake
significantly across the season, although a small but insignificant increase
in EI was observed between the baseline (nontraining) period, in which the
swimmers consumed approximately 1,910 kilocalories per day, and their mid-
season training, during which caloric intakes rose to over 2,389 kilocalories
per day (Kabasakalis et al. 2007). Note that these women were considered to
have normal menstrual cycles, based on the menstrual cycle length.
Troup (1990) also found that EI varied in female swimmers depending on
the time of the season; midtraining or pretaper EI was about 2,700 kilocalo-
ries per day, and end-of-season EI was about 2,400 kilocalories per day. In
another study, VanHeest (1996) saw athletes consume 2,200 to 3,700 kilo-
calories per day during heavy training and 2,000 to 3,500 kilocalories per day
during taper. Results from Zietz and coworkers (2009), who looked at EI in
average-caliber competitive swimmers (10 to 19 years old), found that con-
sumption was markedly different from that of the elite athletes. The females
in this study had EIs ranging as high as 4,411 to 5,258 kilocalories per day
across a season, nearly twice that of the more senior elite female swimmers.
Moreover, the nonelite athletes consumed a somewhat higher percentage of
calories from carbohydrate (50 to 57 percent); the reduced macronutrient was
protein (about 13 percent) (Zietz et al. 2009).
The bottom line is that for either elite or subelite swimmers, energy expen-
diture fluctuates during the season. Females will therefore have to consume
more or fewer calories depending on the phase of training. Coaches talk a lot
about periodization of training and varying volume and intensity throughout
a season. They should also recognize that nutrition, especially as it relates to
caloric intake, needs to be periodized to match energy expenditure.

Energy Restriction
and the Female Athlete Triad
Chronic dietary restriction has been reported for many years in competitive
female athletes. The chronic energy deficit can result in increased risk of develop-
ing a condition that has been termed the female athlete triad. The female athlete
triad is a clustering of three conditions (Nattiv et al. 2007):
• Energy availability: too few calories to support normal physiological function
• Menstrual function: negative changes to the typical menstrual cycle
• Bone mineral density: the amount of various minerals in bone
A position statement issued by the American College of Sports Medicine sup-
ports the concept that a spectrum of disorders affects female athletes (Nattiv et
al. 2007). The female athlete triad is the result of an athlete’s failure to balance
adequate caloric consumption with the energy requirements for sport training
(Cobb et al. 2003). Female athletes exhibit low energy availability for multiple
reasons:
• Pathological eating behaviors
• Attempts to alter body size or composition
• Restrictive eating patterns
• Inability to eat enough calories to match exercise energy expenditure
Low energy availability affects metabolism and endocrine function, resulting
in menstrual cycle changes (Cobb et al. 2003; Nattiv et al. 2007). Prevalence of
the triad in elite female athletes, in general, across multiple sports is 4.3 percent
(Torstveit and Sungot-Borgen 2005). But the prevalence of female athletes pre-
senting with disordered eating (25 to 31 percent) or secondary amenorrhea (3 to
65 percent) is more common (Byrne and McLean 2002; Dusek 2001; Sanborn,
Martin, and Wagner 1982; Sungot-Borgen and Torstveit 2004). Note that the
female athlete triad spectrum of disorders is consistently linked with chronic
energy restriction. Low energy availability has been shown to be highly corre-
lated with reduced swimming performance (VanHeest et al. 2014; VanHeest and
Mahoney 2007). Therefore, female swimmers should be educated about proper
nutrition and sport fueling early in their careers to ensure that they understand
the importance of proper energy intake for both health and performance. Unfor-
tunately, this common sense approach to fueling the body properly is often
overcome by the societal expectation of what a female athlete should look like.
Effects of Chronic Energy Deficits
Energy deficits can result in a variety of conditions including weight loss coupled
with reductions in lean body mass (i.e., muscle mass) (Dulloo and Girardier

--- Page 504 Text ---
|
Female Swimmers 493
1990; VanHeest and Mahoney 2007). When a female swimmer chronically
restricts caloric intake, she will increase both the duration and severity of the
energy deficit. The outcome is a loss of muscle mass and in many instances a
relative increase in body fat, believe it or not (Benardot 2007; Louis-Sylvestre et al.
2003).
Not uncommonly, coaches suggest that female athletes restrict calories to lose
weight and subsequently to perform better in the water. Weight loss is typically
not equated with just fat loss. Studies of female runners and gymnasts reported
the highest body fatness in athletes who also presented with the largest deficits in
energy intake (Deutz et al. 2000). These shifts in lean muscle mass and percent
body fat negatively affect health and performance. The negative changes in body
composition, specifically the decreased muscle mass, can result in a reduction
in overall power and strength.
Chronic energy deficits also can result in reductions in important hormones
such as thyroid hormones (VanHeest et al. 2014; VanHeest and Mahoney 2007).
Thyroid hormones function to increase cellular activity and aid in the control of
metabolism. The thyroid hormones are sensitive to the body’s nutrient status; for
example, low energy or nutrient availability results in reduced thyroid hormone
levels. The decline in thyroid hormones (i.e., triiodothyronine, or T3) has been
related to health issues such as decreased bone mass and reductions in sport
performance (VanHeest et al. 2014; VanHeest and Mahoney 2007). The nega-
tive changes in body composition associated with chronic energy restriction
do not support long-term enhancements in sport performance. Coupled with
the potential of health-related issues such as the female athlete triad, female
swimmers should work to maintain ample fuel supply to meet training and life
demands throughout their careers.
Energy deficits also can arise throughout the day as the result of improper
timing of nutrient intake. Female athletes often consume most of their daily
calories in one large evening meal, typically following their swim workout (Iwao,
Mori, and Sato 1996). Benardot (2007) describes this concept as a “backload-
ing of energy intake.” Meal patterning, or when meals are consumed relative to
training and competition times, has been objectively evaluated in competitive
athletes. The relationship between meal patterning or fuel availability and hor-
mone release is critical for body composition and substrate utilization (Atkinson
et al. 2008; Fogteloo et al. 2004; Mistlberger and Skene 2005).
Figure 23.1 illustrates a typical eating pattern and energy balance of one elite
senior-level female swimmer early in the season (figure 23.1a) and again at a point
sometime in the middle of the season (figure 23.1b). The swimmer consumed
between 1,800 and 2,100 kilocalories on the majority of days during the early
to midseason period. The swimmer was eating two meals (lunch and dinner)
and two snacks for the first three weeks of training. In the middle of the season,
she changed her eating pattern by dropping the lunch meal and increasing the
total calorie content of her dinner following late-afternoon training. The change
in meal patterning resulted in large periods of relative fasting during which the

hormones controlling fuel utilization (i.e., insulin) were negatively affected. The
swimmer reported excessive fatigue, inability to concentrate, lack of motivation
to train, and a decline in performance during this period. When she altered her
dietary pattern (by reinstating a lunch meal), her symptoms declined and her
performance improved during both training sessions and competition. Athletes
need to link dietary intake with energy expenditure throughout the day and
week.

Iron Status in Female Swimmers
Reductions in performance coupled with fatigue, lack of motivation to train,
and physical decline are other conditions commonly seen in competitive female
athletes. Poor iron status can be one of the causes of this chronic fatigue in
competitive female swimmers. Iron deficiency is common in the United States
(Cook 2005), even in athlete populations. Depending on the study cited, female
athletes exhibit iron deficiencies, with and without anemia, at a frequency of 11
to 41 percent (Brownlie et al. 2004; Clement and Asmundson 1982; DiSantolo
et al. 2008; Risser and Risser 1990; Sinclair and Hinton 2005; VanHeest and
Ratliff 1997, 1998).
Clinical Conditions
One clinical condition frequently seen in athletes is dilutional pseudoanemia.
This condition results from an increase in plasma volume coupled with a slight
increase or no change in red blood cell mass (erythrocyte), leading to decreased
hemoglobin concentration (Shaskey and Green 2000). Ferritin (the storage form
of iron in the body) is typically measured to be normal under this condition
(VanHeest and Mahoney 2007). Physical activity has been reported to affect red
blood cell destruction (hemolysis) in various groups including soldiers, runners,
swimmers, and triathletes (Beard and Tobin 2000; Sinclair and Hinton 2005)
and may make these groups of athletes more susceptible to dilutional pseudo-
anemia. Pseudoanemia has been referred to as a typical response to endurance
training. Blood volume increases, while the amount of red blood cells either
decreases or remains the same (Rockwell and Hinton 2005). Some researchers
suggest that an improvement in sport performance occurs when the athlete
exhibits pseudoanemia caused by the increased plasma volume and associated
cardiovascular benefits (Rockwell and Hinton 2005; Deakin 2000; Eichner
2001). A second clinical condition seen in this group is exertional hemolysis, a
condition in which the physical demand associated with intense training leads
to destruction of the body’s red blood cells (Shaskey and Green 2000; O’Toole
et al. 1988).
Another common problem, especially for female swimmers, is iron deficiency
with or without anemia. In iron-deficient anemia, iron stores are depleted and
iron supply to body tissues is restricted (Beard and Tobin 2000; Brownlie et al.
2004). Inadequate dietary intake of iron is the most common cause of this con-
dition. The female athlete’s diet can also contain compounds such as phytates
(from whole grains) or tannins (from tea) that inhibit iron absorption. Female
swimmers often restrict their consumption of meat products (often in attempts
to reduce fat intake) and consume low amounts of vitamin C. Both practices are
known to have a negative effect on the absorption of iron in the body. Coupled
with blood loss from menses and a small amount of exertional hemolysis, a
female swimmer can quickly become at risk for developing iron deficiencies or
anemia.

--- Page 507 Text ---
}
496 VanHeest
Athletes with iron deficiency frequently exhibit symptoms such as decreased
endurance, elevated heart rate, chronic fatigue, and increased risk of illness
(VanHeest and Mahoney 2007; Volpe 2010; Zoller and Vogel 2004). Additional
symptoms include irritability, poor appetite, poor concentration, cold intoler-
ance, and increased rate of headaches (VanHeest and Mahoney 2007; Zoller and
Vogel 2004). Diagnosis of iron deficiencies or anemia is performed through a
blood test. Many of the symptoms overlap symptoms of overtraining, making
a definitive diagnosis of iron deficiency or anemia difficult. Therefore, a physi-
cian should make the diagnosis of iron deficiency or anemia, although distin-
guishing pseudoanemia from iron deficiency anemia with a single blood draw
may be difficult. Athletes and coaches should consider routine blood screening
to monitor for various issues including iron deficiency anemia (Deakin 2000;
Rockwell and Hinton 2005).
Hemoglobin, hematocrit, and erythrocyte count in blood samples drawn
from national-caliber female swimmers across a 32-week season were found to
be significantly lower than in nonathletes (Kabasakalis et al. 2007). In addition,
the female athletes showed a decrease in three markers of iron status—hemoglo-
bin, iron stores, and total iron-binding capacity (TIBC)—over the course of the
competitive season. The changes were seen even though the athletes doubled
their iron intake from 20 milligrams per day to over 40 milligrams per day during
the season through the use of iron supplementation at the onset of training
(Kabasakalis et al. 2007). Sixty percent of the female swimmers were reported
as having ferritin levels below the low end of the reference limits (Kabasakalis
et al. 2007). Data from both elite and junior elite American swimmers support
these findings; approximately 50 percent of elite female swimmers displayed
signs of poor iron status (VanHeest and Ratliff 1997, 1998). Seventy percent were
in pre-stage I (ferritin 20 to 50 milligrams per milliliter), 18 percent in stage I,
and 12 percent in stage II iron deficiency (high TIBC and low Fe) (Troup 1990).
Treatments
Typically, iron deficiency is treated by increasing dietary iron intake. A sports
medicine professional should prescribe iron supplementation regimens or other
treatments such as injections.
Ferrous sulfate is the preferred supplement because of its high absorption
rate (Kim et al. 2002; Weight, Jacobs, and Noakes 1992; Zoller and Vogel 2004).
Drinking a glass of orange juice or consuming 500 milligrams of vitamin C
when taking the iron supplement will improve absorption rates. Regardless of
treatment (i.e., dietary iron supplementation), consumption of caffeine with the
treatment will have the negative result of decreasing iron absorption (Weight,
Jacobs, and Noakes 1992). Note that high doses of iron can result in diarrhea,
nausea, or constipation (Zoller and Vogel 2004). Gradually increasing the volume
of iron intake will help minimize these side effects. Athletes who have normal
levels of iron should be cautioned to avoid supplementation. Excess iron or iron
overload can lead to serious health risks including death.

Female Swimmers 497
The dietary intake of iron in female athletes is often low (Clarkson and Haymes
1995; Kleiner 1995; Hurrell 1997; Zoller and Vogel 2004). The recommended
daily allowance (RDA) for iron is 8 milligrams per day for females 9 to 13 years
old, 15 milligrams per day for females 14 to 18 years old, and 18 milligrams
per day for females 19 to 30 years old (Institute of Medicine 2001). Competitive
female athletes tend to control their diets, often reducing fat and meat intake.
Kabasakalis and colleagues (2007) reported an average iron intake of 14 mil-
ligrams per day from food and 20 milligrams per day from supplements. These
dietary values were similar to those reported by Hawley and Williams (1991)
for age-group swimmers (iron = 14.4 + 3.9 milligrams per day).
The best dietary sources of iron include lean red meats, legumes, nuts, and
fortified cereals. Iron, however, can be found in numerous foods (table 23.1).
Consumption of a varied, healthy diet should provide ample iron resources.
Dietary restriction and use of various methods to control or reduce body weight
can affect iron status in female swimmers.

Oral Contraceptive Use
Oral contraceptive use is common in both recreational and elite female athletes,
and its use brings with it questions about athlete health and performance in the
pool. Typically, oral contraceptives are composed of a combination of estrogen
and progesterone-like compounds; the exact composition depends on the vary-
ing levels of the two steroid derivatives produced by the various manufacturers.
Besides using them for contraception, athletes may be prescribed oral contra-
ceptives to regulate their menstrual cycles or to treat menstrual cycle issues such
as amenorrhea, premenstrual symptoms, and time shifting of cycles.
Athletes often avoid oral contraceptive use because of the reported side effects
such as weight gain, fluid retention, and nausea (Frankovich and Lebrun 2000;
Constantini, Dubnov, and Lebrun 2005). Lower-dose pills with reduced negative
side effects have become more acceptable to female athletes.
The influence of oral ovarian steroids on physical performance has been
assessed over the past several decades. To date, the results remain incomplete;
both positive and negative outcomes have been reported. For example, some
research suggests improvement in muscular strength, power, and endurance
when athletes are on oral contraceptives. The research on oral contraceptive use
and performance remains equivocal (Frankovich and Lebrun 2000).
The normal female reproductive cycle is a complex relationship among various
organs and multiple hormones. Knowing some of the basics will help a coach
understand why and how the hormones contained in oral contraceptives can
affect performance. Five major hormones are involved in the female reproductive
cycle: gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), follicle-stimulating hormone
(FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen, and progesterone (Larsen et al.
2003). The hormones are released from the brain and move through the body to
the ovaries. They have an effect on bone, muscle, breast tissue, heart tissue, and
muscle. The body releases exact amounts of these hormones at specific points
in the reproductive cycle (Sherwood 2008).
Overview of Oral Contraceptives
Oral contraceptive pills are available in three major formulations: fixed-dose,
combination phasic, and daily progestin. Monophasic pills contain a fixed dose
of estrogen and progestin throughout the cycle. Multiphasic pills (i.e., biphasic
and triphasic) decrease the total amount of progestin throughout the cycle, mim-
icking a normal cycle. Injectable progestin-only or combination (estadiol and
progestin) drugs are also available. Although many athletes do not consider the
type of compounds in their oral contraceptives, the formulations are important
to how the pill functions and how it affects metabolism.
Negative side effects such as weight gain, fatigue, headaches, and nausea were
common with early types of oral contraceptives (Lebrun et al. 2003). Newer
lower-dose drugs have minimized the side effects. These formulations have 30
to 40 percent lower levels of hormones, resulting in significantly reduced side

effects. They are therefore more appealing to female athletes (Greenblatt 1985).
Insignificant increases in body weight (about one kilogram over six weeks) have
been reported in female athletes (Lebrun et al. 2003), and no change in body
weight has been reported in female nonathletes (Rosenberg 1998). Remember
that the performance of female swimmers may be affected by even a small
increase in body weight or a small change in body composition.
Performance Outcomes
Research continues on the effect of oral contraceptives on performance. Results
depend on the type of oral contraceptive, the dose, and the type of activity. Out-
comes related to substrate or fuel utilization, anaerobic performance, muscle
performance and damage, and aerobic performance are presented and discussed
in this section. Table 23.2 provides a summary of these factors.
The various compounds found in oral contraceptives have been shown to
affect metabolism in multiple ways. Ethinyl estradiol has been shown to decrease
amino acids; increase cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or HDL,
the so-called good cholesterol) and triglycerides; and decrease low-density lipo-
proteins, or LDL (the so-called bad cholesterol) (Dorflinger 1985; Godsland,
Crook, and Wynn 1992). Derivatives of 19-nortestosterone have been shown to
increase plasma insulin; decrease glucose tolerance and cholesterol, HDL, and
triglycerides; and increase LDL cholesterol (Bonen, Haynes, and Graham 1991;
Constantini, Dubnov, and Lebrun 2005; Dorflinger 1985; Suh et al. 2003).
Oral contraceptive use appears to have no effect on anaerobic performance.
The research assessing oral contraceptives and anaerobic performance is limited.
Most studies have shown no effect of oral contraceptives on anaerobic power
or capacity. Continued research is essential to understand the relationship in
female athletes.
The use of oral contraceptives may protect against muscle damage. Muscle
tearing or ultrastructural damage is a common characteristic of physical exertion.

The role of estradiol, one of the estrogens, on membrane structure has been
studied. Although studies of the relationship between oral contraceptive use
and muscle damage in athletic women using oral contraceptives remain unclear,
women who use oral contraceptives reported lower muscle soreness scores fol-
lowing an exercise routine (Thompson et al. 1997). Additional research suggests
a protective role of oral contraceptives on muscle damage (Bar and Amelink
1997; Carter, Dobridge, and Hackney 2001). Overall, estrogens, specifically
estradiol, appear to provide a protective influence against muscle damage and
muscle soreness following exercise.
.
Regular oral contraceptive use may decrease VOmax, or the body’s ability to
2
take in, transport, and use oxygen (De Souza et al. 1990; Bemben et al. 1992;
Bemben, Salm, and Salm 1995; Lebrun et al. 1995; Lynch and Nimmo 1998).
Early studies reported no difference in performance between oral contraceptive
.
users and nonusers as it relates to VOmax (McNeill and Mozingo 1981; Huisveld,
2
Haspers, and Bernink 1983). Triphasic drugs used by moderately active women
.
caused a significant decrease (about 11 percent) in VOmax following four weeks
2
of oral contraceptive use (Casazza et al., 2002; Constantini, Dubnov, and Lebrun
.
2005). Other studies reported a decrease in VOmax following a two-month
2
intervention protocol (Lebrun et al. 2003).
Other factors such as heart rate, concentrations of iron or ferritin (the storage
form of iron), and hemoglobin (iron-binding protein in red blood cells) are not
altered with oral contraceptive use (Mooij et al. 1992). Because these factors did
not change, it was unclear why aerobic capacity declined. The sympathetic ner-
vous system is designed to activate the body’s resources under stressful conditions
through what is often called the fight-or-flight system (Sherwood 2008). Oral
contraceptives reduce activation of the sympathetic nervous system, resulting in
decreases in aerobic capacity (McMurray, Mottola, and Wolfe 1993).
Summary
Females are participating in the sport of swimming in growing numbers each
year. Although swimming provides many health benefits, most coaches and
athletes focus on performance outcomes. Research and clinical suggestions
continue to aim at optimizing performance in all female swimmers.
Female athletes must work to maintain energy balance during both train-
ing and competition. Dietary consumption of iron is essential to optimal
performance. Swimmers should be aware of meal patterning by providing fuel
throughout the day and avoiding the consumption of one large meal at the end
of the day.
Female athletes who intend to use oral contraceptives should consult with
their physicians about the type of drug to use. Education is essential for female
athletes and coaches who train female swimmers. They should continue to
monitor new research findings.

CHAPTER
Open Water Swimmers
—Steve Munatones
Swimming faster in the open water involves optimizing and maximizing mul-
tiple factors: technique, integration of the sport sciences, training, feedings
and nutrition, race tactics, and intangibles such as navigational IQ and tolerance
to venomous stings. Compared with the pool, the dynamic environment that
swimmers can encounter in open water swimming is incredibly varied. A number
of variables can change even within a race. Even the range of venues that people
can swim in—oceans, lakes, canals, rivers, reservoirs, fjords—highlights the
challenges of open water swimming. Consider some of the dynamic challenges
that an open water swimmer can face:
• In ocean races, a variety of marine life may be present—some colorful and
beautiful (e.g., tropical fish and sea turtles) and others treacherous and
harmful (e.g., sharks and Portuguese man-o-war). Additionally, swells and
tides can push swimmers off course or influence race strategies.
• In river and bay swims, changing currents can be tricky and frustrating,
requiring the swimmer to invest significant additional effort.
• In point-to-point lake swims, intermediate buoys and turn buoys only
occasionally give an accurate indication of the distance left to swim.
• In a competitive race within a large pack, swimmers can become boxed in
and limited in what they can do or see, short of stopping or slowing down.
• In a cold-water course, swimmers often need to focus on overcoming the
effects of hypothermia. The reverse occurs with hyperthermia in warm
water.
• During channel swims, swimmers often have to swim in pitch darkness
and try to reach land on a rocky coastline.

Consequently, open water swimmers have to be able to adapt to and handle
the unexpected. Preparing for the unknown becomes increasingly important,
especially when compared with pool swimming.
To excel and achieve their potential, swimmers must appreciate and plan
for six physical parameters, or critical characteristics, of open water swimming
(figure 24.1):
1. Distance (short or long)
2. Water condition (smooth or rough)
3. Water type (fresh or salt)
4. Currents (with or against)
5. Temperature (cold or warm)
6. Race type (solo or races)
As with pool swimming, training specificity is important in open water
swimming. Although a short-distance freshwater race conducted under smooth
conditions in warm water may resemble the tranquil conditions found in a pool,
on the opposite end of the spectrum are marathon saltwater swims, which are
typically attempted under rough conditions in cold water. Just as preparation
for a 50-meter freestyle is vastly different from preparation for a 400-meter IM

in the pool, the ways in which an open water swimmer prepares for different
types of events differ. Swimming faster in the open water requires swimmers to
understand and manage the optimal combination of factors that will prepare
them to handle the situations that they may encounter.
Besides these physical parameters of open water swimming, athletes face a
number of psychological obstacles not experienced in pool swimming. Again,
the dynamic environment provides unique challenges compared with swim-
ming in a pool. Open water swimmers often undergo a unique form of sensory
deprivation; they may not know exactly where they are during a race, they may
not be able see or hear much around them, and probably most important, they
may not know what conditions they will encounter during their swim. As such,
educated guesswork; assumptions based on tides, wind, and weather; and gut
feel are the tools of experienced open water swimmers rather than the split
times and lap counts that are used in the domain of the pool. While pool swim-
mers focus on their pace, competition, and technique as they push themselves,
open water swimmers need to anticipate all of these unknowns, clouded in a
haze of uncertainty. As conditions change for the worse, jellyfish stings are felt,
or water temperature drops, these changes can wreak havoc with an athlete’s
psyche.
Although the dynamic and unpredictable nature of open water swimming
presents a wide range of challenges, an equal number of practical tools are
available to the swimmer to maximize performance. This chapter examines the
myriad factors that have a significant effect on performance and describes how
swimmers, by understanding these factors, can maximize their performances
in the open water.
Distance: Short or Long
Both short and long races provide unique challenges that swimmers must prepare
for. Whatever the distance, swimmers need a good navigational IQ to help them
get through the course efficiently.
Short Races
In a short open water race, a good warm-up is vital because the race typically
will start at an extraordinarily fast pace, ranging anywhere from an all-out run-
ning sprint down the beach to a 400-meter pace for the first turn buoy in an
in-the-water start. Swimmers generally start fast in these short-distance races to
establish a good position early and gain an optimal position approaching the
first turn buoy.
To prepare for these short-distance races, swimmers need to withstand a
significant and sustained increase in heart rate, similar to what occurs during
a 400-meter freestyle. This ability can be improved by repeatedly doing ins-
and-outs along the shoreline whereby the swimmer runs into the open water
from shore, swims straight out in the water, turns around a buoy or at a specific

distance, swims back, dolphins through the shallow water, and then runs back
up on shore. Sport-specific improvements also can be achieved by regularly
doing deck-ups, a series of repeat swims, performed on a certain interval (e.g.,
5 × 100 at 1:20 or 10 × 50 at 0:50), in which swimmers pull themselves out
of the water after each repeat. This deck-up set can be followed by a standard
long-distance, short-rest interval set (e.g., 5 × 500) to simulate the steady-state,
aerobic type of swimming that athletes will experience after the high-intensity
start. Ins-and-outs and deck-ups will both create significant heart rate spikes as
swimmers change body position from horizontal to vertical and back again.
Another item to factor into preparation for open water swimming, and one
that swimmers can specifically train for, is body contact. Physical contact among
swimmers is typically more of an issue in a short-distance race than a mara-
thon race, especially at the start, finish, and around the turn buoys. To become
accustomed to the physicality experienced in the open water and duplicate it in
the pool, several swimmers can swim shoulder to shoulder in one lane during
a pool workout. An example set for this training is 12 × 100 meters with three
teammates starting together. Each athlete takes the middle position on four
of the repeats and then rotates to either the left- or right-side positions for the
other repeats.
Long Races
To prepare for marathon races of 10 kilometers or longer, swimmers should
regularly perform distance tolerance sessions in which they ultimately build
up to swimming distances of at least 60 percent of the expected race distance.
If the race is 25 kilometers (15.5 miles), the distance tolerance workouts should
gradually be increased until the distance covered in one continuous swim is 15
kilometers. Similarly, if swimmers will be in the water for eight hours on a long
swim, the distance tolerance sessions should build up until the athletes are able
to swim five hours on their longest nonstop training swims.
Open water swimming nutrition and in-race fueling is another area to address
in training. A swimmer’s preparation for any swim that will take longer than
one hour to complete should include experimenting with various refueling and
rehydration flavors, types, and strategies, including practicing with gel packs
and water bottles to identify what works best for optimizing performance.
Like marathon runners and triathletes, swimmers should rehydrate or refuel
frequently during a marathon swim. Athletes should try different flavors and
different formulations with occasional solid food or gels to find what the body
will tolerate. If an athlete swims in saltwater, keep in mind that any food or
drink will likely taste different than it would in a freshwater swim, especially as
the swim distance increases. During practice, swimmers should become accus-
tomed to putting gel packs in their swimsuits and then removing and quickly
consuming them while treading water. Athletes should do their experimenta-
tion during training and should not introduce any new nutrition or hydration
practices during a competition.

Navigation
Navigational IQ is a term used to describe a swimmer’s ability to swim straight
and steady under the dynamically changing or challenging conditions encoun-
tered in open bodies of water. This skill is important because whether the race
is short or long, swimming faster often depends on the swimmer’s ability to
swim straight.
A swimmer’s ability to swim straight, especially when waves are battering
the athlete or race buoys are far apart, is critical to keeping the race distance to
a minimum and swimming faster. Swimming in a straight line requires a bal-
anced stroke in which propulsion and drag resistance are produced equally on
both sides of the body. Although many coaches and athletes advocate bilateral
breathing, which works well for developing a balanced stroke in many swim-
mers, the ultimate goal is to create symmetry in the arm strokes, kick, and head
position. Bilateral breathing can help swimmers become more symmetrical
and balanced, but a flaw in the stroke (e.g., a crossover kick or crossing over the
centerline with the hand path when breathing to one side or the other) may be
the fundamental reason that a swimmer cannot swim straight in the open water.
Often, in the last part of a race, when they are moving the fastest or when
they are making a surge, the best swimmers—no matter their age or speed—are
able to swim straight without the benefits of lane lines or bilateral breathing.
An analysis of their swimming technique shows that they have a symmetrical
stroke in which there is little or no crossover kick even if they frequently look
up to sight the finish. After each breath, or head lift to sight, the head position
is aligned with the spine and the eyes are looking straight down. These athletes
also tend to have a remarkably similar pattern of force development with both
the left and right hands underwater, which subsequently leads to a symmetric
pattern of speed and acceleration. This symmetry helps them swim straight. In
addition to being more efficient, being able to swim straight has an additional
benefit in that the athletes can swim more economically because they don’t need
to lift the head to sight as often.
Poor stroke symmetry is associated with various negative effects on swimming
speed in the open water. Figure 24.2 presents an overview of the cycle that can
ensue from having an unbalanced stroke in the open water. If swimmers can
improve their stroke balance and symmetry in the pool, then they will be able
to improve speed and navigational IQ in the open water as well.
Developing a balanced stroke and high navigational IQ takes practice, focus,
and patience. Few athletes have an innate talent to swim straight even in glassy
water, let alone turbulent water. One simple test that can be performed in the
open water to confirm whether swimmers have a symmetric stroke is for the
swimmers to stand on the shoreline and identify a target (e.g., a buoy, break-
water, pier, pontoon, anchored boat, or lifeguard stand or tall building in the
distance) that they will swim toward. The swimmers dive into the water and
take 50 to 100 strokes toward the target with their eyes closed. At that point they
stop swimming and check to see whether they veered to the left or right of the

how far they naturally deviate from the straight-line path. Knowing this infor-
mation is the first step toward being able to balance the stroke and compensate
appropriately during open water races. This test is best performed in calm water
first and then later in rough water. Although swimming in smooth water in the
morning hours is often more enjoyable, learning to swim straight in the midst
of heavy surface chop is invaluable. By learning to swim straighter when the
wind is blowing, the current is running, and the line of vision is minimized by
surface chop or waves, the swimmer will gain considerable confidence.
Conditions: Smooth or Rough
Water conditions will also affect how a race should be approached. Differ-
ent swimmers likely will excel under different conditions depending on their
strengths and weaknesses. In smooth water where surface chop is virtually
nonexistent, few dynamic elements will affect a swimmer’s ability to produce
forward velocity. But some surface conditions may be beneficial to the swim-
mer. More likely than not, a rhythmic pattern to the surface chop or swells will
allow swimmers to stretch out their stroke and use a lower arm stroke tempo
than they need under rough water conditions, or vice versa. Stroke rate may vary,

--- Page 518 Text ---
|
Open Water Swimmers 507
depending on the situation. With that said, research shows that an increased
arm stroke turnover is usually the key to swimming faster for most people in the
open water. Swimmers need to make sure that they do not get lulled into using
a methodical, slower-than-normal stroke rate when competing under glassy,
calm conditions if they want to swim faster.
A few words about stroke technique in the open water and the interplay of
stroke rate and stroke length are useful here. Swimming velocity is a function
of both stroke rate and stroke length, and an athlete can swim faster by increas-
ing one or both variables. Most of the recommendations that characterize
good in-pool swimming also pertain to swimming well in the open water, but
some differences (e.g., sighting and drafting) introduce variances to the ideal
open water swimming technique. In research on swimmers at every level, from
Olympic medalists to newcomers, tests show that forward velocity is maximized
as a swimmer’s hand moves underwater between the breastbone and the belly
button. Whether a person is swimming in smooth or rough conditions, this
point in the stroke is where the greatest propulsion is generated. Conversely,
forward velocity is minimized as the hand enters the water until the catch, the
position at which the hand is approximately 25 to 45 degrees under the surface
of the water and ready to initiate the pull (see figure 24.3). In most cases, this
decrease in forward velocity corresponds to the point in the stroke cycle at which
the opposite hand is pushing past the hips as the stroke is finished. A swimmer
experiences accelerations and decelerations within each stroke cycle (see figure
24.3). As is the case in pool swimming, the goal in open water swimming should
be to reduce the magnitude of these oscillations because swimming is energeti-
cally most efficient when traveling at a constant velocity.
If we now imagine that the hand moves 180 degrees from the entry to the
catch, then through the pull into the recovery, and finally back to the hand entry,
the swimmer’s hands and forearms generate propulsion during a relative small
percentage of the entire 180-degree range. Although minimizing drag resistance
is important, generating propulsion is even more critical to swimming faster in
the open water.
 Figure 24.3 Sample forward velocity profile produced when swimming freestyle.
Fluctuations in velocity occur as speed decreases during the hand entry and finish and
increases when the hand is underneath the body in the power position.

When we observe the swimming styles of world-class and even average open
water swimmers at their fastest paces (i.e., at the start and toward the finish)
during a race, we find that a higher arm tempo and stroke rate (SR) is an impor-
tant element to swimming fast. In a review of the 5-kilometer, 10-kilometer, and
25-kilometer open water races at the 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2007, 2008,
and 2009 World Championships, the fastest men generally swam using a stroke
rate in excess of 41 stroke cycles per minute (82 individual arm strokes per minute
[SPM]). The fastest women generally swam with a stroke rate over 43 cycles per
minute (85 SPM) throughout most of their races. In general, swimmers took 5 to
10 strokes per minute fewer in the 25-kilometer races compared with the shorter
distances. Peak stroke rates increased to between 45 and 50 cycles per minute as
both male and female swimmers reached their maximum speeds during the race.
As a means of comparison, the average stroke rates for pool distance swimmers
were found to be 41 or 42 stroke cycles per minute for men (1,500-meter swim)
and 47 or 48 cycles per minute for women (800-meter swims).
Although most swimmers will not be able to initiate or maintain as high an
arm turnover as world-class swimmers do, a faster arm turnover is one good way
to swim faster. All swimmers need to learn what their average stroke rates are.
They can begin by asking a friend or coach to count the strokes taken during a
minute of steady-state swimming in the open water. If the average SR is 70 SPM,
then to swim faster the athlete should try to swim at 72 to 75 SPM for as long as
possible during an open water workout. When no longer able to hold this pace,
the swimmer can reduce the SR to recover and then repeat.
A high-elbow recovery and a high-hand recovery are preferable in situations
in which whitecaps or high surface chop exists. Modifying the arm stroke to
prevent the arms and hands from being battered about in the turbulence will
save energy and minimize frustration. Although swimming with surface chop
does not usually cause problems, swimming against surface chop occasionally
leads to unintentional swallowing of water. To reduce the chances of swallow-
ing water, the swimmer can slightly modify the head position to breathe farther
back in the stroke under the armpit and away from the oncoming waves and
surface chop.
Of course, kicking also has an effect on performance. An open water swim-
mer’s legs may often serve as ballast rather than provide propulsion, allowing
the swimmer to maintain a more balanced stroke in the swells and surface chop.
Although a swimmer may unintentionally do more crossover kicking in turbulent
conditions, most of the body should remain in a relatively streamlined position
by maintaining a strong core and firm neck position. A swimmer with a strong
core, especially when combined with a small-amplitude kick and a shallow
sighting technique, is better able to maintain a streamlined body position even
while struggling with turbulent surface chop.
Although kicking faster (e.g., by increasing kick tempo from a two-beat kick to
a four-beat or six-beat kick) likely will enable a swimmer to go faster in the open
water, it also taxes the body physiologically because it uses the larger muscles in

--- Page 520 Text ---
|

the legs, which in turn consume more oxygen. Unlike in pool swimming in which
there are turns and changes of direction every lap, kicking faster, especially when
done inefficiently in the open water, is a proven way to get winded if an athlete
has not trained for this level of sustained effort. A smaller, more compact kick
is recommended for open water swimming. Kicking harder (i.e., kicking deeper
and more forcefully) can be suboptimal because doing so takes the body out
of a streamlined position and exposes more of the body to the dynamic forces
that produce drag. Like most skills, however, kicking, and even being able to
maintain a higher kick tempo, can be developed. Not long ago athletes believed
that maintaining a six-beat kick in the 1,500-meter freestyle would consume
too much oxygen and couldn’t be done. But by training their bodies to support
this level of kicking, many swimmers can now use a six-beat kick in races in
which they traditionally relied on a two-beat kick. Clearly, a 1,500-meter pool
swim is much different from a 10K marathon swim. The message, however, is
that the body can be trained to support a higher kick rate, especially if it is used
strategically at specific points in the race.
Body position in open water swimming is critical, just as it is for in-pool
swimming. But open water swimming brings huge challenges not seen in the
pool, including sighting and drafting. Swimming through whitecaps and against
surface chop is not pleasant and is frequently frustrating. Even with great stroke
symmetry, swimmers need to lift the head and sight off a buoy or other landmark
to stay on course. If we assume that swimmers lift their heads every 25 meters
in a 10K race, they will ultimately lift their heads approximately 400 times
during the race. Because the head weighs about 10 pounds (4.5 kg), swimmers
are partially lifting an additional 4,000 pounds (1,800 kg) that they would not
have to lift over the equivalent distance in a pool. Even taking into account the
natural buoyancy in the water, which makes the effective lifting of the cumu-
lative 4,000 pounds much lighter, swimmers are still placing a lot more stress
on the lower back, neck, and shoulders than they would swimming in a pool.
Therefore, having strong core muscles (abdominals and lower back) and main-
taining overall body flexibility are both critical to maintaining a proper body
line and sighting technique in the open water. Keeping the body as streamlined
as possible, even when sighting with increased frequency, will help reduce drag.
A strong core can help keep the hips and legs from dropping too much, which
is a prime contributor to drag. As rough water pushes, lifts, and drops the body
into various positions, a strong core can help keep the body more streamlined
by preventing the lower body (hips and legs) and upper body (shoulders) from
snaking side to side.
Water: Fresh or Salt
Freshwater is not as dense as saltwater. Because buoyancy is determined by the
density of the water, a swimmer will naturally ride higher in saltwater compared
with water in lakes, rivers, or reservoirs. Therefore, maintaining body position

and streamlining is often easier in the ocean than in freshwater, where the
muscles of the core must provide this missing support.
Buoyancy may be the major difference between freshwater and saltwater, but
other differences can affect the swimmer as well. Many open water swimmers
experience a bloated sensation of their lips, mouth, and tongue when swimming
for long durations in the ocean. One recommendation is for the swimmer to
wash the mouth periodically with mouthwash after a feeding during a mara-
thon swim to avoid this sensation. Feeling a more normal sensation in the lips,
mouth, and tongue on a long swim can help performance.
Psychologically, for some swimmers, competitions in the ocean require a dif-
ferent mentality for them to perform at their best. Experienced ocean swimmers
often have a mind-set that minimizes thoughts about risks such as marine life
that can frighten some people. The depth and dynamics of the ocean, especially
fear of its natural inhabitants, can be problematic for many newcomers. Swim-
ming with friends or parallel to shore is a way to overcome these fears.
Currents: With or Against
Swimming with fast currents and along tidal flows in oceans, bays, and rivers can
feel great because swimmers can use this moving water to swim faster than they
would in a pool. When large ocean swells, whitecaps, or heavy surface chop is
moving in the direction of travel, swimmers can lengthen out the stroke, reduce
the kick, railroad (or propel themselves along) with the waves when possible,
and conserve energy while still moving quickly. Swimmers should use these
elements to their advantage, even if it is riding the wake of a passing boat. This
technique is a sign of high navigational IQ. Conversely, swimming against cur-
rents and tidal flows either head on or laterally is frustrating. When swimming
loop or out-and-back courses, swimmers may face currents, tidal flows, and
ocean swells in one direction and then have these same elements in their favor
in the other direction.
Temperatures: Cold or Warm
Few things are more difficult to overcome than extreme water temperature,
whether too warm or too cold. Both hypothermia (i.e., decreased core body
temperature) and hyperthermia (i.e., increased core body temperature) play
havoc with the swimmer physiologically, and staying focused is difficult when
the body is dramatically cooling or heating.
The feeling of physical discomfort created by sustained immersion in cold
water is distinct. The ability to think clearly, enjoy the race, and swim efficiently
is severely hampered in cold temperatures. Short of wearing a wetsuit, neoprene
cap, and silicone earplugs, the most effective way to prepare for cold water is
acclimatization; to swim well in cold water, swimmers must practice in cold
water. There are no shortcuts, medicines, or magic solutions. Putting thick coats

--- Page 522 Text ---
|
Open Water Swimmers 511
of lanolin or petroleum jelly on the skin only reduces the initial sting of the cold
water; skin lubrication will not retain body heat as a wetsuit will. Acclimatiza-
tion to cold water takes patience, commitment, and consistency. Swimming in
cold water day by day, week by week, and month by month is the only way to
develop the ability to swim well for sustained periods in the cold. Consistency
and a gradual lengthening of cold-water practices are essential if a swimmer
decides to do a cold-water swim. Consistently performing cold-water training for
even short periods (i.e., less than 10 minutes) will enable swimmers to increase
the time that they can tolerate the cold. In less-than-ideal situations, swimmers
should carve out at least 14 to 21 days to adapt to the cold in advance of a race,
gradually increasing the amount of time spent in the water over that period.
Being able to swim fast in warm water can also be tricky, but developing
that ability is typically much less difficult and time consuming. Holding on to
snow cones and putting the feet in an ice bath are some quick ways to lower
body temperature before a race. Reducing the kick (e.g., from a four-beat kick
to a two-beat kick) may also help minimize heat stress and ultimately allow a
swimmer to swim faster. But swimming in warm water does not come without
risk. Excessive water temperature can be dangerous, as evidenced by the tragic
death in 2010 of open water swimmer Fran Crippen, who was competing in a
10K marathon swim in water temperatures in excess of 87 degrees Fahrenheit
(30.6 degrees Celsius). The water temperature likely led to exertional heat illness
that ultimately caused his death.
Proper nutrition and hydration are important, whether swimming in warm or
cold water. Because of the perception that water is cool, swimmers often do not
realize how much they sweat. Therefore, they do not properly hydrate during a
training session or race. Swimmers should practice proper nutrition and hydra-
tion habits during training. Any dizziness, disorientation, or extreme fatigue
should be immediately reported to a coach or teammate.
Type: Solo Swims or Races
Solo swims are entirely different from competitive races. Solo swims are usually
long-distance individual efforts that are supported by an escort crew. They can
be marathon swims across a channel, a charity swim in a lake, or a multiday
stage swim in a river. Besides the mental aspects of a solo swim, swimmers face
logistical and financial issues. The swimmer must select pilots and escort boats,
carefully study water and weather conditions, decide courses and start times,
and organize a support team.
Planning a solo swim requires documenting, discussing, and deciding hun-
dreds of details. One of the important decisions that swimmers make is who
will be on the escort boat. Selection of the support team is a critical decision.
Is the pilot experienced? Will anyone on the support team get seasick, divert-
ing attention and support from the swimmer? Will the team fully support the
swimmer through the night? Are the crew members compatible with each other?

--- Page 523 Text ---
}
512 Munatones
A swimmer does not want to be frustrated, upset, or disappointed by a sick or
uncooperative crew member. A swimmer can ill afford avoidable distractions
and impediments to success while in the open water.
In assembling the support team and defining responsibilities, the swimmer
should appoint one person on the crew to make the final decision to pull the
swimmer from the water, if necessary. This person should have the final say if
the swimmer’s safety is threatened. This person—the pilot, coach, or observer—
must be familiar enough with the swimmer to know how hard he can reasonably
and safely push himself. By knowing about the athlete’s training, personality,
and abilities, this person can help the swimmer reach his goal. The person must
balance the responsibility of keeping the swimmer safe with the goal of pushing
the athlete to realize his full potential.
Competitive Racing
Many open water swimmers train individually, but they race in competitions
where they’ll be in the water with dozens, if not hundreds, of other athletes.
With the addition of the 10K marathon swim to the 2008 Beijing, 2012 London,
2016 Rio, and 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, the competitiveness of open water
swimming at all levels and ages has increased. Athletes are swimming faster than
ever before, and their training is becoming more specific to reach their goals.
Let’s look at the factors that influence open water competition and the way in
which swimmers can best prepare to excel in the open water.
To optimize performance in the open water, athletes should base their pool
and open water training on the pyramid of open water success. These seven
essentials, summarized in figure 24.4, include the optimal training concepts that

can be implemented in preparing for races of all distances. The amount of time
that athletes spend on each of the seven essentials depends on the time of year,
where they are in their training cycle, the amount of time the swimmers are able to
dedicate to training, and the athletes’ personal goals and swimming background.
Base training, speed training, and distance tolerance form the base of this
open water training philosophy. A good base, or foundation, is essential for an
athlete to excel in the open water. These fundamental concepts are rooted in
the competitive pool training philosophies that have been used successfully
for decades.
Race-specific training, skills training, and open water acclimatization are at
the next level. These three fundamentals are less well known among coaches and
athletes, but they are specific to open water swimming and equally important
to incorporate in a training regimen.
Tactical knowledge is at the apex of the pyramid. Tactical knowledge refers to
the knowledge and understanding of what to do in a dynamic environment in
which the competitors, weather, and water conditions can change in a moment’s
notice. To perform well in any open water swim, a swimmer needs to antici-
pate, adapt, and respond to moves by the competition during the race as well
as to changes in the natural environment. Tactical knowledge includes study
of everything from the elements (tides, currents, and waves) to the tendencies,
strengths, and weaknesses of competitors. A swimmer can obtain and enhance
tactical knowledge through observation, study, and race experience.
Developing the Base of Speed and Endurance
Base training helps to establish a solid foundation. Swimmers get in good physi-
cal shape by swimming thousands of meters during hundreds of aerobic training
sets in the pool. Base training also includes dryland training, specifically stretch-
ing and strength training that focus on maintaining overall strength balance
throughout the body and building muscular endurance. Even the shortest open
water competitive distance is a highly aerobic event. As such, success in open
water swimming requires solid aerobic capacity.
Depending on a swimmer’s experience, the amount of training time available,
and the distance of the swim, base training can take on various forms. Swimmers
who need to fit in training around work and family obligations might do 2,000
yards per session several days a week. World-class athletes might swim 10,000
meters per day six days a week.
The quality of training will affect performance on race day. But whether a
swimmer is an elite athlete or a casual masters swimmer, the key to developing
a training base is consistency. Consistency will help build a solid foundation
that will fuel optimal performances. Swimmers who consistently practice by
swimming at least a half of the eventual total race distance will likely develop a
base that is strong enough to support good performances at competition time.
Therefore, an athlete who is aiming to swim a 10K marathon swim should regu-
larly do at least 5K per training session.

--- Page 525 Text ---

Although most of the energy that supplies the working muscles in an open
water swim is produced by aerobic metabolism, the anaerobic system is impor-
tant as well. Speed is needed to produce the final kick to the finish, to counter
a move made by a competitor, to cross a strong current, or to break away from
the pack. Regular speed training, another cornerstone in swimming, involves
developing the anaerobic system by performing short-duration efforts (less than
two minutes) at high intensity.
Establishing a Tolerance for Distance
Distance tolerance training helps ensure that a swimmer has the ability to swim
the specific race distance on competition day. For shorter distance open water
races, swimmers should strive to develop the ability to swim 130 percent of
the target race distance. That is, a swimmer who wants to be competitive in a
2.5K race should be able swim at least 3 kilometers straight at a decent pace.
If athletes build up to a distance 30 percent longer than the race, they will be
prepared to swim well even if the water is colder than expected or the currents
are stronger than expected. The extra 30 percent provides the athlete with a
buffer to cover the unexpected conditions and intangibles that inevitably occur
in open water races.
These distance tolerance guidelines should be modified for marathon
and longer distance swims. For swims up to and beyond 25 kilometers (15.5
miles), athletes should build up to at least one swim that is 60 to 80 percent of
the expected marathon distance. In most instances, the longest training swim
should be done approximately two to four weeks before the date of the com-
petition. In training for an ultramarathon race (e.g., 21-mile [33.8 km] English
Channel), swimmers should gradually build up to a six- to eight-hour swim,
ideally performed in the water temperature expected at the ultramarathon.
Governing bodies set parameters for swimmers to qualify for channel swims.
For example, the Channel Piloting and Swimming Federation requires solo
swimmers who attempt an English Channel crossing to complete a certified
swim of six hours in water under 61 degrees Fahrenheit (16 degrees Celsius)
or provide proof of completing an acceptable alternative swim. An athlete
who can complete a 15-mile (24.1 km) training swim should be prepared
to cross a 21-mile channel, especially if the physical conditioning is part-
nered with strong psychological preparation and an experienced pilot and
support crew.
Simulating Racing Conditions
Coaches often overlook race-specific training. This training component can be
used to simulate open water race situations in the pool and can help acclimate
a swimmer to open water races in which physical contact, running in and out
of the water, drafting, and positioning are part of racing. Some examples of
simulated race condition exercises are described here.

Open Water Swimmers 515
Paceline Sets
Paceline sets are drills in the pool in which groups of swimmers (generally three
to five) draft off one another, swimming behind the toes of the swimmers in front
of them in one lane. In this way, the swimmers use drafting, much like a cycling
peloton in the Tour de France. For 100-yard paceline sets, the leader of the group
swims 100 yards at a set pace. The other swimmers follow closely behind. After
100 yards, the leader momentarily stops and waits at the side of the lane as the
other swimmers continue swimming. The swimmers keep the same order as the
new leader takes over and leads the group for the next 100 yards. This pattern is
repeated until everyone leads the aquatic peloton for two to four rotations.
If each leader swims at a fairly good pace, the swimmers gain the following
advantages:
• Excellent aerobic workout
• Practice drafting on the feet of teammates
• Learning to conserve energy while drafting at a good pace
• Increased awareness of other swimmers and practice at swimming in groups
• Practice in increasing and decreasing pace in the middle of a training set
Pool Open Water (POW) Swims
Even without access to an open water swimming venue, open water racing can be
replicated with pool open water (POW) training. POW is an easy-to-implement,
educational, and enjoyable introduction to open water swimming that leads
to increased confidence and helps acclimate pool swimmers to the open water
environment. POW can prepare swimmers for the rigors of swimming in the
open water. POW enables a swimmer to practice the following:
• Swimming without lane lines and without following the black lines on the
bottom of the pool
• Swimming in a pack of swimmers
• Performing quick turns around buoys in traffic
• Swimming without pushing off the pool walls
• Executing defensive and offensive racing maneuvers and tactics
• Positioning and drafting in various positions
• Dealing with the physicality of swimming in close proximity to other
swimmers
POW swimming is typically conducted after removing the lane lines and
setting four turn buoys in the corners of the pool near the intersection of the
backstroke flags and the outside lane lines. This arrangement creates a rect-
angular course that is parallel with the perimeter of the pool. If all lane lines
cannot be removed because other swimmers are also using the pool, a few lane
lines can be removed and two turn buoys can be set near the ends of the pool.

 Figure 24.5 Pool open water (POW) training.
This configuration reduces the footprint necessary to hold a POW workout and
provides the same benefits.
After a POW course is set up, swimmers can practice left- and right-shoulder
turns around the buoys (see figure 24.5) by alternately practicing in clockwise
and counterclockwise directions. The ability to make turns in either direction
is important because there are no standard open water courses or turns.
POW swims are useful training tools, but the following guidelines can make
these training sessions even more beneficial:
• When a group of swimmers becomes accustomed to POW swimming, add
different configurations to the workouts. By doing X- or Z-shaped patterns
in the pool, swimmers can become adept in doing any type of turn in the
open water (see figure 24.6).
• A triangular course allows swimmers to practice turns at various angles,
not only 90-degree and 180-degree turns.
• The coach can use a whistle and issue yellow and red penalty cards in prac-
tice to simulate what swimmers might experience in races.
 Figure 24.6 Pool open water training in a Z-pattern.

|
Open Water Swimmers 517
• Hold some POW sessions in a shallow pool to create more turbulence.
• Practice onshore finishes by doing deck-ups at the end of each set.
• If a large number of swimmers are participating, groups can be set off at dif-
ferent times to maximize the number of people using the course (see figure
24.7). For example, when the first swimmer of group 1 reaches the first turn
buoy, the second group can start, enabling more swimmers to swim the
course simultaneously.
• To help swimmers become familiar with various positions that they may
encounter in races, mix up the positions (e.g., inside or outside, front of the
line or drafting, or boxed in) within any given POW set.
• Swimmers need to remain alert for physical contact. Impeding or interfer-
ing with teammates is not the goal, but it will happen in POW workouts.
Deck-Ups
Deck-up sets are another race-specific training drill for onshore finishes. In deck-
up sets, the swimmers immediately pull themselves out of the pool after every
swim and then dive back into the pool to start the next swim. This drill helps
swimmers get accustomed to the rapid body position change (from horizontal
to vertical) that occurs in an on-the-beach finish.
Developing the Requisite Technical Skills
Skills training teaches the finer technical points of open water swimming, includ-
ing feedings, sightings, starts, turns, positioning, and navigation, all of which
can be simulated in a pool.
Simulating Feedings
If a race is longer than an hour, swimmers should hydrate during the race. Just
as runners and triathletes would not compete for more than an hour without
hydration, swimmers should hydrate for optimal performance. Athletes should
 Figure 24.7 Starting a POW set.

}
518 Munatones
drink from a water bottle during their pool workouts to practice feedings. They
should also practice drinking while treading water in the pool, not while hanging
on the wall, to simulate hydrating in open water swims. Alternatively, athletes
can practice putting gel packs in their swimsuits and quickly consuming them
while swimming in the middle of the pool. Again, proper nutrition should be
practiced in training, using the specific products and feeding schedules that the
athletes plan to use during competition. Athletes should not try anything new
or experiment on the day of a race.
Practicing Navigation
Swimmers can practice navigation and sighting in the pool by lifting their heads
and looking forward every fourth lap while doing interval training. They can
practice various permutations of this set to make effective sighting second nature.
They should try to avoid dropping their hips significantly or lowering their legs
when they lift their heads to sight. They should push the water backward, not
downward, in the first part of the arm stroke to maintain maximum forward
velocity during sighting. Additionally, athletes should incorporate bilateral
breathing in their pool training sets, even if they traditionally favor left- or
right-side breathing. Breathing on both sides will help to balance their strokes
and develop musculature to provide a strength balance throughout the body
and around joints like the shoulder. The ability to breathe bilaterally will also
enable athletes to check on their competition, sight landmarks and navigational
points, and breathe away from oncoming waves in the open water.
Rounding Buoy Turns
Even without turn buoys in a POW set, swimmers can practice turns by swim-
ming to the ends of the black lines on the bottom of the pool. Without touching
the wall, swimmers can turn around to head back in the opposite direction to
simulate an open water turn. The turn can be accomplished in a variety of ways:
• Swimmers can do a regular flip turn at the end of the black line without
touching the wall and build momentum by taking a few quick arm strokes
augmented by a strong freestyle or scissors kick.
• Swimmers can perform an open turn at the end of the black line without
touching the wall. They can effectively change direction by turning on their
sides while performing a crossover arm stroke with the outer arm and a
scissors kick.
These no-wall turns simulate open water turns because the athletes have to
change direction without the benefit of the pool walls, exactly what they need
to do in the open water.
Practicing Starts
Starts can appear chaotic as dozens of swimmers jockey for the same position

in the water. For inexperienced competitors, the start can be intimidating, but
they can practice and become more comfortable with starting before the actual
race. Swimmers can practice open water starts in a pool by swimming shoulder
to shoulder with two teammates in the same lane. By experiencing physical con-
tact in practice, the athletes will not get frustrated in a race when unanticipated
physical contact occurs.
With practice, swimmers will eventually learn to protect their space and
swim defensively, offensively, or aggressively. To maintain position, defensive
swimmers protect their space when they get bumped. Offensive swimmers liter-
ally move toward and into the space of their competitors to draft or otherwise
influence the race by forcing other swimmers to change their race tactics. This
action may happen at key points in race, and swimmers may do it purposefully
or inadvertently.
Aggressive swimmers intentionally bump or veer into competitors, driving
them in a direction that they may not wish to go. Swimmers can swim very close
to competitors in open water swimming. In doing so, the other swimmer will
likely become uncomfortable and move over slightly, allowing the first swimmer
to dictate race tactics and possibly gain a competitive advantage.
Swimmers who prefer to swim offensively or aggressively will bump and make
other contact against the torso, feet, legs, arms of competitors (figure 24.8). These
swimmers should be careful not to impede the progress of other swimmers, and
they should recognize that the more aggressively they swim, the more likely
they are to become the recipient of retaliation at some later point in the race.
Expecting the Unexpected
Mishaps occur in open water races. Swimmers may lose their goggles or swim
caps. Or they may accidently get petroleum jelly on their hands from brush-
ing up against competitors. Swimmers should practice these situations in the
 Figure 24.8 Swimming defensively and offensively at a FINA World Cup race.

pool—swim without goggles, swim without a cap, smear petroleum jelly on their
hands in a workout—so that they can become adept at handling these situations
if they occur in a race. Athletes and coaches should take time to consider what
could happen and develop proactive steps to adapt. Preventative steps, such as
taping goggles to the swim cap (figure 24.9), can address situations that could
pop up in a race.
Acclimating to the Open Water
Open water acclimatization, especially for newcomers, enables swimmers to
become familiar with the marine environment. They need to become accustomed
to water that can be cold, warm, rough, polluted, or abundant with marine life.
Open water acclimatization should deal with the specific factors that swim-
mers expect to encounter in a race, including water that is extremely deep, water
that is so clear that the swimmer can see everything below, or water that is so
dark that the swimmer can see nothing at all. Both total visibility and no vis-
ibility can be difficult psychological barriers for some people. A swimmer who
is nervous about water conditions should swim with experienced teammates to
receive support and help in dealing with those issues. Open water acclimatization
also includes swimming into jellyfish, through waves, or amid boat fumes, sea-
weed, pollution, and flotsam. Some swimmers who experience these situations
for the first time in a race may become either frustrated or shocked. Unless the
swimmer is hurt or hyperventilating, the best approach is to keep swimming.

Being able to do this, however, requires preparation to deal with the unexpected.
What happens if the swimmer encounters an unforeseen or alarming situation?
The focus should be on remaining calm or returning to a state of calm. All the
actions listed here can reassure athletes who encounter difficult situations. After
the athletes have regained their composure, they should start swimming again.
• Lift the head and look around to see other athletes. Watching others can
help relieve stress in an anxious situation.
• Swim closer to shore.
• Switch to breaststroke or backstroke.
• Raise the arms or call over and talk with safety personnel.
Developing Tactical Knowledge
In a sport that is becoming increasingly popular and consequently more competi-
tive, developing tactical knowledge and learning to swim an intelligent race are
critically important. This training component is often overlooked. Understanding
why packs form, how they form during various points in the race, and why packs
take certain shapes during a race will help swimmers elevate their performance.
Because thousands of situations can occur in open water swimming, develop-
ing tactical knowledge is an ongoing process that evolves over time. With solid
tactical knowledge, a swimmer will better understand what it takes to achieve
success in the open water.
Swimmers should be sure to take advantage of the resources available. These
days, many races are posted online through video-sharing services such as You-
Tube. Studying these videos can help swimmers learn the tactics of successful
open water swimmers. After every race each athlete should conduct a postrace
analysis by thinking about, discussing, and reviewing the performance.
The coach can assist this effort by asking a series of questions using the Socratic
method. An experienced open water swimming coach is inquisitive after a race
and helps the athlete understand what worked well and what could be improved
the next time out. By asking questions, coaches enable their athletes to internal-
ize and understand what they did in a race, both good and bad. By visualizing
and becoming aware of things such as who they were swimming with, what
their pace was, how they felt, what shape the pack took at various points in the
race, and what their positioning was during the race, athletes eventually become
more seasoned performers. Open water coaches who question their athletes
before and after a race help them understand what they can and should do. The
athletes are out there in the open water all alone. Every decision they make in
competitive situations—at the start, at the turn buoys, setting up the finish, and
during the final sprint—has a direct effect on their performance, placing, and
time. Athletes must make these decisions quickly in a dynamic environment.
Therefore, coaches can assist their swimmers by questioning them and pushing
them to come up with the right answers for themselves in various situations.
Sample questions that will help athletes develop this tactical knowledge and

--- Page 533 Text ---
}

become more accountable for their performances are listed here.
Before the race, coaches can ask these questions:
1. Will you use petroleum jelly, lanolin, Trislide, or another product? Do you
have rubber gloves to apply the skin lubricant? How many pairs of goggles
are you taking to the race?
2. Who is your competition?
3. What is your goal?
4. How did you do last year? Were you satisfied?
5. Who was swimming in front of you?
After the race, coaches can ask about the start:
1. Where were you at the start?
2. Who was next to you?
3. Did you choose that position?
4. What was the pace at the start?
5. How did you feel until the first turn buoy?
Regarding the middle of the race, coaches can ask these questions:
1. Where were you in the middle of the race?
2. Did you purposefully go to this position?
3. Were you boxed in at any point?
4. When did the pace pick up?
5. Who was swimming in front of you?
6. Who was swimming behind you and to your left and right?
7. Are these swimmers faster than you?
8. What was your stroke tempo?
Regarding the turns, coaches can ask these questions:
1. Did you speed up before or after the turn buoys?
2. Did you have the inside position around the turn buoys?
3. Did you get hit? What did you do?
4. How can you avoid being hit around the turns next time?
5. What was your position going into the turns?
6. How did you make the turn?
Coaches can ask these questions about navigation:
1. Did you know where you were going at all times?
2. Was it hard to see anything?

--- Page 534 Text ---
|
Open Water Swimmers 523
3. Did you take a good line to the finish?
4. Did you feel any ocean swells out there?
5. How often were you lifting your head to sight?
6. Did you see the lead kayak or lead boat?
7. What side were you breathing on? Or did you breathe on both sides?
Regarding the finish, coaches can ask questions like these:
1. When did the sprint begin?
2. Did you catch up to anyone after the sprint began?
3. Were you using your legs the whole time?
4. Did any physical contact occur coming into the finish?
5. Were you satisfied with your finish?
6. How can you train for a better finish?
Although questioning athletes in this way is not exactly the Socratic method
used in the academic world, the idea is to help the athlete improve and under-
stand the myriad situations that happen in the open water.
Summary
Some people swim to win, whereas others simply want to finish or improve their
times from the previous year. For each type of swimmer, tactical knowledge
comprises a different spectrum of information. At its simplest level, tactical
knowledge includes only knowledge about the race course. At its highest level, tac-
tical knowledge includes course information, use of the elements, and in-depth
knowledge of the strengths, weaknesses, and expected tactics of competitors.
Swimming to win is the ultimate competitive approach. Winning can result in
anything from handshakes from the competition to prize money and endorse-
ments. As famed UCLA basketball coach John Wooden stated, “Success is a peace
of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best
to become the best you are capable of becoming.”

CHAPTER
Adaptive Swimmers
—Brendan Burkett, PhD
The foundation for Science of Swimming Faster is made up of three main sec-
tions: swimming mechanics and technique, aspects of training and com-
petition, and applied sport science and medicine. Within these three sections,
many specific topics that discuss attributes that contribute to swimming faster
have been addressed. These same three sections and subsequent specific topics
form the backbone for the discussions presented in this chapter. In some cases
the guidelines set forth are the same regardless of the group of swimmer being
considered. For example, the fundamental principles underlying propulsion and
drag are the same for able-bodied and adaptive swimmers alike. In other cases,
the differences are significant. For example, a swimmer who has a spinal cord
injury and spastic muscles may develop a fixed-hip contracture and will have to
adopt different techniques to maximize performance. Throughout this chapter,
only brief statements will made in cases where the considerations for adaptive
swimmers are the same as those for able-bodied swimmers. Otherwise, a more
detailed description about the science behind swimming faster in adaptive
swimming will be presented.
The highest level of competition for adaptive swimmers with a locomotor
disability, a visual impairment, or an intellectual disability is the Paralympic
Games. This competition is held every four years, traditionally following the
Olympic Games. Paralympic athletes compete in 18 summer sports, and swim-
ming has been part of each Paralympic Games since the inaugural 1960 event
in Stoke Mandeville, United Kingdom. Paralympic swimming generally follows
the same International Swimming Federation (FINA) rules that are used with
able-bodied swimmers, with some essential modifications, such as allowing
one-handed touches for swimmers who can extend only one hand out in front.

With that said, specific and unique biological requirements are associated with
particular physical disabilities. As a result, an overview of the Paralympic clas-
sification system will lend clarity to the subsequent discussion on the science
of swimming faster for adaptive swimmers.
Paralympic Swimming Classification System
The original classification system used in swimming was based on a medical
model, and athletes competed within five classes of disability:
1. Athletes with an amputation, defined as having at least one major joint in
a limb missing (i.e., elbow, wrist, knee, ankle)
2. Athletes with cerebral palsy, defined as having the cerebellar area of the
brain affected, which, through palsy, affects the control of movement
3. Athletes with a spinal cord injury or other condition that causes at least a
10 percent loss of function in the lower limbs (e.g., traumatic paraplegia
or quadriplegia)
4. Athletes with a visual impairment (i.e., perception of light or hand move-
ment to a visual acuity between 2/60 and 6/60 or a visual field of greater
than 5 degrees and less than 20 degrees)
5. Athletes with les autres, a French phrase meaning “the others.” This group
comprises athletes who do not fit within one of the other disability groups
but have a permanent physical disability (e.g., one femur shorter than the
other, resulting in a significant difference in leg length)
Today, competitions for people with locomotor disabilities are organized under
a functional classification system in which swimmers with various physical
disabilities compete against each another. Swimmers with physical disabilities
compete in one of the following:
• 10 S classes (S1 to S10: for freestyle, backstroke, and butterfly events),
• 10 SB classes (SB1 to SB10: for breaststroke events), and
• 10 SM classes (SM1 to SM10: for individual medley events).
The separate classes distinguish between the distinct arm-dominant free-
style, backstroke, and butterfly strokes; the leg-dominated breaststroke; and
the individual medley, which includes all four strokes and therefore warrants
its own classification system. Athletes rated as a 10 on the classification scale
(e.g., S10, SB10, SM10) have the greatest function. Function gradually decreases
(the scope of the disability increases) as the classification moves closer to a 1
rating (S1, SB1, SM1).
Swimmers with visual impairment are divided into three classes—S11, S12,
and S13—depending on the level of visual impairment. A person with normal
vision can read newsprint at a distance of 100 centimeters, an S13 swimmer

--- Page 538 Text ---
|
Adaptive Swimmers 527
needs to be at 10 centimeters to read the same text, an S12 athlete can read the
text at a distance of 4 centimeters, and an S11 cannot read the text at all. S11
swimmers are required to wear blackened goggles to level the playing field and
ensure that all swimmers have the same level of vision. To ensure that the visu-
ally impaired athletes do not run into the wall when swimming, tappers are
used during competition. The tappers, positioned on the pool deck at each end
of the pool, notify swimmers that they are approaching the wall with a gentle
tap using a long rod with a soft bulbous end.
The international swimming community also includes swimming classes for
athletes with intellectual disabilities (S14) and hearing impairment (S15). These
athletes currently compete outside the Paralympic Games, although for the 2012
London Paralympic Games, swimmers with an intellectual disability competed
in a limited number of events. This functional system has been used during
the previous five Paralympics Games and is subject to continued evaluation.
The Paralympic swimming classification system places swimmers with vary-
ing impairments together in one class. Classification is based on a number of
factors, such as muscle strength, movement coordination, joint range of move-
ment, and limb length. In fact, swimming is the only sport that combines the
conditions of limb loss, cerebral palsy, spinal cord injury (weakness or paralysis
involving any combination of limbs), and other disabilities (such as Dwarfism,
major joint restriction conditions) within the same competitive class as well
as across classes. Each swimmer must undergo an internationally approved
classification procedure that includes medical and swimming evaluations. For
more detail on the swimming classification system, go to the International
Paralympic Committee website at www.paralympic.org/classification.
From a swimming-specific coaching perspective, the classification system is
the method of providing a fair and equitable level of competition for athletes
with disabilities. Coaches just need to know that their athletes have classifica-
tion numbers, just as athletes have weight divisions in sports such as boxing.
Our job is to prepare athletes to perform to their maximum potential; their
level of classification will not change if we improve their skill level.
Understanding Propulsion and Drag
The same principles of propulsion and drag apply to all swimmers, regard-
less of ability level, and these principles affect the technique used to achieve
optimal performances. One of the fundamentals in swimming is that to swim
faster, propulsion must increase, drag must decrease, or a combination of both
must occur. When analyzing the swimming mechanics for adaptive swimmers,
some variations may be used to generate these net forces. Swimmers with an
amputation, cerebral palsy, or spinal cord injury may use different movement
patterns because of their disabilities, but the same underlying mechanical
principles apply. For example, a swimmer who is a single-leg amputee will
have a smaller base of support on the blocks, affecting the swimmer’s ability

--- Page 539 Text ---

528 Burkett
to achieve balance during the start. The natural compensations that the swim-
mer makes on the blocks can lead to asymmetry on entering the water, which
in turn can lead to altered swimming mechanics underwater and when stroking
(e.g., altered interarm stroke coordination).
Swimming Mechanics:
Swimmers With a Physical Disability
Consider some of the ways that a physical disability can affect stroke technique.
A swimmer with a lower-limb amputation, for example, will likely be able to
maintain a body line, stroke rate, and stroke length profile similar to those of
an able-bodied swimmer. The timing and type of kick used, however, may vary
depending on the extent of the disability. Swimmers with a lower-limb amputa-
tion tend to use a crossover kick; that is, they kick down on one side in time with
the alternate arm stroke and then cross over and kick on the other side to counter
that arm stroke. Some swimmers have used the typical one-side-only kicking,
but this technique tends to inhibit their longitudinal body roll in the water. The
kick rate for the single-lower-limb swimmer is naturally slower than that for a
two-legged swimmer. The risk of shoulder injury is also a higher than normal
for the lower-limb amputee. This circumstance is attributed to the increased load
placed on the shoulder opposite the side with the leg amputation; this shoulder
needs to skull the water to maintain balance as well as generate greater under-
water force to make up for the lack of the kick that would normally accompany
the pull. The lower-limb amputee can use a modified fin during training to
unload the shoulder, provide the required overload for the residual stump, and
subsequently develop beneficial musculoskeletal symmetry throughout the body.
For swimmers with cerebral palsy, the neuromuscular impairment associated
with this disability can influence swimming mechanics, particularly because
these athletes often fatigue earlier than able-bodied swimmers do. This fatigue
tends to exaggerate any asymmetry between stroke sides, which can lead to
increased risk of injury or require the swimmer to adopt novel strategies to
generate propulsion.
Similarly, the loss of abdominal control and core stability associated with a
spinal cord injury can affect swimming technique, depending on the location
of the spinal lesion. The potentially smaller propulsive surface associated with
the physical disability or an unbalanced capacity for propulsion when compared
with an able-bodied swimmer can influence the swimmer’s mechanics.
Swimming Mechanics: Swimmers With a
Visual Impairment or Intellectual Disability
Swimmers who have a visual impairment or an intellectual disability generally
follow the same swimming mechanics and techniques as able-bodied swimmers

--- Page 540 Text ---
|
Adaptive Swimmers 529
because they have the same physical ability. These athletes may use some minor
variation in swimming technique in the early stages, such as when they are
approaching the end of the swimming pool. In some cases, swimmers may be
cautious when approaching the end of the pool because of the difference in
visually acuity—they do not want to run into the end of the pool. This issue
will diminish with experience. For swimmers with an intellectual disability, this
caution about the end of the pool will naturally diminish as their confidence
grows. Swimmers with a visual impairment or intellectual disability should be
aiming for the able-bodied model of swimming technique.
Freestyle, Backstroke, Breaststroke,
and Butterfly Technique
The techniques used when swimming the four strokes are similar for all swim-
mers because the rules of the sport specifically describe what is required for each
stroke. For example, in breaststroke the swimmer’s arms and legs must move
in a simultaneous movement, in contrast to the alternating movement patterns
of backstroke. Therefore, the techniques used for swimming these strokes are
typically more similar than different, regardless of disability. Freestyle, as the
name suggests, allows swimmers to choose their strokes, and able-bodied swim-
mers generally choose the front-crawl style. The same selection mostly applies
to adaptive swimmers, but as the level of disability increases, some swimmers
may select a different stroke in the freestyle event, such as backstroke, which is
a popular choice for those who have difficulty rotating to breathe in freestyle.
Technique Considerations
for Starts and Turns
The start is an important component of the complete swimming race because it
is the section of the race where the swimmer is travelling at the fastest velocity.
Typical average velocities for elite male able-bodied swimmers over the first 15
meters of the race are around 3 meters per second, whereas free-swim velocities
are about 1.8 to 2 meters per second for elite freestylers. The adaptive swimmer
who has a mild or minimal disability can also achieve these velocities. Therefore,
regardless of ability level, swimmers need to maximize their velocity at the start
and continue this velocity as long as possible into the race.
Some components of the swimming start, such as the underwater phase and
break-out stroke, are repeated with every turn that the swimmer makes. Thus,
any improvements made to the underwater components of the swimmer’s start
can apply throughout the race after every swimming turn. Technical modifica-
tions to the swim start have been found to reduce swimming race time by 0.10
seconds, and because races have been won and lost by a tenth of this margin,
an effective start is critical.

The Swimming Start
The swim start is defined as the distance to the 15-meter mark in the race, which
coincides with the break start rope and is the maximum distance a swimmer can
travel underwater. According to FINA rules, the same applies to adaptive swim-
mers. The swim start can be divided into a number of subsections including time
components (block, flight, underwater, and free swim) and distance components
(entry, underwater, and free swim). In a study of 200-meter starts, 95 percent of the
variance in start time was attributed to the underwater phase. Greater entry distance
had little relationship with the start time (r = 0.046) (Mason and Cossor 2000).
Scientific analysis of the swim start combines the kinematic analysis of seg-
ment movements such as rate of arm swing, path of the movement of the head,
and the explosive power of the lower limbs. Some work has been done in this
area by studying the starts of Olympic swimmers, and similar research is cur-
rently being conducted on Paralympic swimmers. Paralympic swimmers who
have reduced balance control, such as lower-limb amputations or cerebral palsy,
can find balancing on the starting block difficult. Understanding the relationship
between balance and propulsion off the blocks requires specific comprehension
of the forces generated on the starting block, the positioning of the athlete, and
the velocities and accelerations of the human segments as the swimmer leaves
the block and enters the water. As discussed in chapter 6, detailed analysis of the
start requires the use of specific technology (force plates and underwater video
cameras), but many of the techniques described for working with able-bodied
swimmers can also be employed in adaptive swim programs.
To understand the swimming start and considerations for adaptive swimmers,
comparisons between Olympic and Paralympic swimmers have been done. In a
2010 study by Burkett, Mellifont, and Mason (2010), three specific Paralympic
classifications were studied:
• S8, in which swimmers had full use of their arms and trunk with some leg
function (can include coordination problems), had double limb loss, or
had use of only one arm
• S9, in which the swimmers had severe weakness in one leg only, swam with
very slight coordination problems, or had one limb loss
• S10, in which the swimmers had minimal weakness affecting the legs, swam
with restriction of hip joint movement, swam with both feet deformed, or
had a minor limb loss or loss of part of a limb
Within these classes, three Paralympic disability groups were represented:
swimmers with an arm amputation (leg-dominant swimmers), swimmers with
a leg amputation (arm-dominant swimmers), and swimmers with hemiplegic
cerebral palsy (neuromuscular-impaired swimmers).
Investigating the various disabilities of the Paralympic swimmers enabled
the researchers to monitor the influence that some of the variables had on the
swimmers’ starts. The investigators hypothesized that the different classes of

--- Page 542 Text ---
|
Adaptive Swimmers 531
Paralympic swimmers would execute specific components of the start differently,
and this was found to be the case. Here are some of the key results.
The influence of block time is apparent when analyzing swimmers with
cerebral palsy, because their inhibited neuromuscular recruitment results in an
inefficient link in the kinetic chain. Therefore, they are not able to generate fast
block times.
When comparing the start time to 15 meters, a significant difference was
found between the Olympic swimmers and three Paralympic classes; the start
time progressively increased as the disability level increased. A similar finding
was observed in other studies that found distinct changes in swimming perfor-
mance in the different Paralympic classes (Daly et al. 2001).
The only variable that distinguished start performance between the S9 and
S10 classes was underwater velocity. A review of the underwater video footage
showed that the S9 swimmers were not able to hold their streamline as effec-
tively as the S10 swimmers. This difference could be attributed to the greater
level of disability (such as a greater leg amputation), which naturally affected
the swimmers’ balance. The result was that the S9 swimmers oscillated more
as they corrected their balance, resulting in a less effective streamline position.
The S10 swimmers were able to develop an underwater velocity comparable to
that of the Olympic swimmers, both of which were significantly higher than the
velocity of the S9 and S8 swimmers. The ability of the S10 swimmers to match
the Olympic swimmers in underwater velocity reflects the minimal disability
of these swimmers. For example, the arm amputees within the S10 class were
missing an arm below the elbow, and the loss of this limb generally affects only
the swimmer’s arm stroke.
The applied research found that underwater velocity had the greatest influence
on the swim start time, so that is an area that the S9 and S8 swimmers need
to work on to improve performance. Analysis of the underwater video footage
showed that both of these classes of swimmers tended to have a wider streamline
profile, which naturally creates increased resistance that consequently reduces
underwater velocity. Improved streamlining could help with their underwater
technique.
Swimmers with cerebral palsy may require other specific changes, such as
interlocking their hands, to prevent the arms from drifting apart underwater
and negatively affecting drag when streamlining underwater.
The underwater footage showed that the transition from the underwater phase
to the stroke preparation phase appeared appropriate for the S9 and S10 swim-
mers because they maintained their streamlined body position and started their
first underwater arm stroke just before breaking the surface of the water. Kick-
ing was maintained throughout the transition from underwater to the surface.
The entry distances, underwater distances, and free-swim distances all fol-
lowed a similar pattern; a significant difference was seen between the Olympic
swimmers and all Paralympic classes. Although the S10 and S9 swimmers had
similar distance relationships, these were significantly different from those of
the S8 swimmers.

--- Page 543 Text ---
}
532 Burkett
The Olympic swimmers and the arm amputee swimmers generated essentially
the same entry distance. If the Olympic swimmers are used as a benchmark for
ultimate performance, then this result indicates that the arm amputee swim-
mers, whose greatest strength is their legs, may have modified their starts to
maximize the entry distance and capitalize on their leg strength.
Olympic swimmers recorded the longest underwater distances. The S10 and
S9 swimmers recorded a similar but shorter distance, and the S8 swimmers
recorded a significantly shorter distance. The fact that the Olympic swimmers
traveled an underwater distance almost double that of the S8 swimmers indicates
the difficulty that the S8 swimmers had holding a streamline position because
of their neuromuscular or major limb loss of function.
When comparing specific disabilities, the swimmers with a leg amputation
or cerebral palsy had shorter underwater distances, although they were not sig-
nificantly different. Both groups of swimmers have reduced kicking capability
because of the loss of a leg or the involuntary muscle spasms that occur in CP,
which would interfere with a coordinated leg-kicking action. The result is that
the above-water free-swimming phase is more efficient when compared with
the kicking-dominant underwater phase.
Because of the diversity in the physical ability of the Paralympic swimmers,
the underwater distance traveled depends on the strengths and weaknesses
(underwater streamlining and kicking efficiency) of the individual swim-
mer, although a key requirement for all groups was a smooth transition from
underwater to free swimming. Although a difference was found in the absolute
distance that the swimmers traveled underwater, in relative terms no difference
was seen between the three Paralympic swimming classes, although the entire
group of Paralympic swimmers spent significantly less time underwater. This
similar proportion of time and distance spent in each phase, regardless of Para-
lympic class, indicates that the swimmers use a similar swim start technique.
S10 and S9 swimmers generated similar free-swimming profiles that were
significantly different from both the Olympic and S8 swimmers. Recalling
that the swimmers with minimal disability (S10) were able to generate good
underwater velocity, this finding indicates they were not able to transfer this
attribute into free swimming. Once underwater, the S10 and Olympic group
were able to develop similar underwater velocities, which probably related to
their similar ability to place and hold their bodies in a streamline position and
then to use two fully functional legs to drive to the surface for the break-out
stroke. This skill of obtaining a streamline body position and kicking until
the swimmer slows to near race pace has been identified as a characteristic of
competitive swim starts.
The transition from underwater to free-swim velocity showed some interest-
ing relationships. The S9 and S8 swimmers transitioned from underwater to free
swimming with the least drop in velocity. This observation indicates that these
swimmers have determined the appropriate time and distance within their starts
to transition from underwater to free swimming, a critical feature identified in

--- Page 544 Text ---
|
Adaptive Swimmers 533
other studies (Lyttle et al. 2000). Because the free-swimming velocity is a function
of the preceding underwater velocity, the minimum loss during the transition
from underwater to free swimming is critical. The aim for the swimmers was
a seamless underwater to free-swimming velocity transition. Each athlete may
need to be analyzed individually to account for athlete-specific idiosyncrasies,
but this research provides important information to guide further investigation.
Most important for swimmers and coaches, these components of the start can be
modified with training. As with other changes in technique, such as breathing
patterns and stroke rates, these elite athletes can apply this new knowledge to
help improve their swim start performances.
The Swimming Turn
The swim turn is another important area in understanding the science of swim-
ming faster in adaptive swimming. Research has commonly identified underwater
velocity as the only variable that distinguishes elite swim turn performances
from others. Underwater video footage demonstrates that swimmers who can
hold their streamline more effectively tend to generate faster underwater velocity.
Athletes with an amputation are naturally asymmetrical and may find it difficult
to maintain balance. They tend to oscillate more as they correct their balance,
resulting in a less effective streamline position. A similar scenario applies to
swimmers with cerebral palsy.
The ability to produce force for the push-off phase of the turn is also a con-
sideration for the adaptive swimmer. Applying the scientific principles of energy
transfer through the kinetic chain suggests that loss of strength, coordination,
range of motion, or accuracy of movement force results in inefficient force dis-
sipation from the kinetic chain. The result could be a less efficient turn.
Analysis of the fundamental principles of a swim start and turn demonstrate
that there are some elementary differences for the swimmer with a disability
compared with the able-bodied swimmer. But the influence of a specific dis-
ability on a swimmer’s ability to produce an effective start or turn has received
comparatively little discussion in the research literature. This is a shortcoming
of previous studies because the Paralympic classes are collections of athletes of
different abilities and the level of physical function within these classes naturally
varies. By considering only the class, and not the disability, some key features
of athletic performance are hidden. For example, although a significant differ-
ence is seen in the absolute start time between the Olympic swimmers and all
three Paralympic classes (S10, S9, and S8), no significant difference is found in
start time between the three disability groups of arm amputee, leg amputee,
and cerebral palsy. The block times of the S10 and S9 swimmers, as well as the
arm and leg amputees, were similar, whereas the cerebral palsy and S8 swim-
mers had significantly slower block times than all other swim groups. This
result highlights the finding that the impaired neuromuscular motor pattern
in people with cerebral palsy affects the execution of movement patterns and
causes delayed planning of movement.

Effect of Technology on Swimming Technique
In the endeavor to go higher, faster, and longer, athletes have found ways to use
technology to enhance performance. Assistive technologies such as wheelchairs
and prostheses can clearly help disabled athletes function and recover out of the
water, but what technology can be used in the water? As in Olympic swimming,
Paralympic athletes are permitted to wear only a swimsuit, goggles, and swim
cap; Paralympic athletes are not permitted to use any prostheses or assistive
devices while in the water. In some cases, the additional technology required
for the adaptive swimmer can be simple. For example, figure 25.1 shows a swim-
mer with no arms using his teeth to hold on to the towel or rope for the race
start. This technology, while not a new device or invention per se, represents an
advancement in thinking and creativity that enables the swimmer to execute a
better start, thereby enhancing performance.
Technology to Measure
Swimming Performance
A number of technical devices have been developed to measure swimming
performance. Because the adaptive swimmer requires a more sensitive analy-
sis of the propulsion and drag relationship, this technology is important
for advancing the science of swimming faster. One such device is a velocity
meter, which can measure the velocity of the swimmer continuously and
in real time. This biomechanical measure can provide vital feedback to the
athlete and coach about swimming performance. The use of this technology
allows informed decisions to be made about any technique modifications for
the adaptive swimmer. For example, the swimmer with an arm disability can
benefit greatly from this form of analysis because the influence of kicking or
stroking with the amputated limb can be objectively quantified.
 Figure 25.1 Swimmer using his teeth to hold on to a towel or rope before the race
start.

|
Adaptive Swimmers 535
Another application for the velocity meter is to measure an athlete’s abil-
ity to maintain a streamline when pushing off from the wall or during the
underwater phase of the swimming start. For example, swimmers traditionally
maintain an underwater streamline phase as long as possible before gradually
rising to the top of the water. The adaptive swimmer may have an impaired
ability to hold an effective streamline (arm amputee or cerebral palsy) or
an inefficient single-leg kick. The biomechanical measure of instantaneous
velocity will enable the optimum underwater time to be determined for
the Paralympic athlete. This measure has several other applications, such
as monitoring velocity fluctuations within the high-drag strokes such as
breaststroke. By quantifying the athlete’s velocity, the correlation with other
biomechanical measures of stroke rate can be investigated. This will enable
the optimum stroke rate of the athlete to be determined. When the swimmer
uses a resistive device, or tether, the measure of instantaneous velocity can
provide insight into the swimmer’s stroke-by-stroke force production and
anaerobic power.
Video is another technology that can provide useful feedback on start-
ing, turning, and free-swimming technique. This technology can be used to
quantify the arm-stroke timing within the complete swimming stroke, as well
as inter- and intraswimmer variability. Using this information, the timing of
the swimmer’s stroke can be modified, which is particularly important for the
adaptive swimmer. For example, the swimmer’s stroke may be quantified as a
catch-up stroke, in which the hand of the swimmer effectively catches up to the
opposite hand at the front of the swimmer’s stroke. This technique generally
suits swimmers who have a powerful leg kick or a strong, powerful swimming
stroke. Adaptive swimmers may need to modify their index of coordination
based on the measurement of instantaneous swimming velocity.
Application of Swimming Mechanics and Technique
To develop a swimmer’s optimal swim mechanics and swimming technique,
the coach and sport scientist first need to watch how the swimmer is moving
though the water. An effective way to accomplish this is to use a video camera
that provides a hard copy of the swimming, offering features such as slow
motion and, more important, providing a time point for comparison. When
making changes to a swimmer’s mechanics, coaches rely on their fundamen-
tal understanding of what is required to move faster through the water—an
increase in propulsion and a reduction in resistance. For the swimmer with a
disability, a range of techniques may be successful for moving through the
water. There is no right or wrong method. The key is to apply the funda-
mentals of propulsion and resistance.

Recent developments in microtechnology have enabled previously unknown
swimming measures to be made, such the swimmer’s kick count and kick rate.
The kick is typically hidden within the turbulent whitewater of the swimmer,
and the kick rate is typically too fast to be measured by the human eye. Small
inertial sensors, approximately 25 millimeters long and 8 millimeters thick
and weighing less than 20 grams, have been attached to swimmers’ legs to
measure this new sport science variable. The swimming coach can use this
knowledge to design the training program and develop the appropriate swim
race strategy.
Energy Systems and Their
Application to Swimming
Swimming performance has been extensively studied from the standpoint of
energetic characteristics, including lactate production and degradation, oxygen
consumption, and heart rate variability. With any athlete, the difference between
gold and silver or bronze and fourth can be as small as 0.35 percent, or 0.01
second. Therefore, anything that can make a difference in athletic performance
is eagerly sought by Olympic and Paralympic athletes. The role of energy systems
for the adaptive swimmer is similar to that for the able-bodied athlete, with a
few special considerations, such as thermal regulation. See chapter 8 for more
information on the physiology of training, all of which can be applied to work
with adaptive swimmers.
Of course, able-bodied and adaptive swimmers differ in some important ways.
Thermal regulation can be challenging for Paralympic swimmers, even though
they are competing in an aquatic environment. Because thermal regulation is
related to surface area and basal metabolism, the adaptive swimmer can be sensi-
tive to small changes in the environmental or water temperature. For example,
an athlete with a spinal cord injury tends to have a reduced lower-limb surface
area because of the associated muscular atrophy; a similar scenario exists for the
amputee who has lost part or all of a limb. This different surface area naturally
influences an athlete’s thermal regulation. Furthermore, the modified neuro-
muscular system of some athletes with cerebral palsy has resulted in heightened
sensitivity to hot and cold conditions.
The preparations and possible adaptations that needed to be made for the hot
and humid environments of the Athens and Beijing Games were major issues for
Olympic and Paralympic athletes. As with other applications, the initial sport
science approach was to develop generic guidelines and principles for all athletes,
but in many cases these standards fell short of addressing the specific needs of
Paralympic athletes. From this starting point, however, the Paralympic coach
and sport scientist can either adopt the same guidelines or conduct research that
will lead them to modify this approach and address the unique characteristics
of athletes with disabilities.

Evaluating Performance and Test Sets
Evaluation of a swimming performance is often defined by the fundamental
biomechanical parameters of velocity, stroke rate, stroke length, stroke index,
active drag, power output, and propelling efficiency. To achieve a certain veloc-
ity, the swimmer adopts a specific relationship between stroke rate and stroke
length, concomitant with her interlimb coordination.
Kinematic variables can be used to describe and evaluate performance, but
the collection and analysis of these data can involve significant effort. The best
approach is to use easy and applicable test sets that yield performance-affecting
data. Three test sets are presented here: a progressive step test, efficiency golf
score, and starts and turns. These test sets have been found to be particularly
useful for the adaptive swimmer.
Step Test
A common test set in swimming is the step test, which involves swimming seven
200-meter repeat swims at a controlled pace. For the adaptive swimmer who
may not be able to swim this distance, the step test can be modified to reflect
shorter distances or fewer repeats such as 6 × 100-meter repeat swims instead
of 7 × 200. The step test is designed to train swimmers to develop their sense of
pace and to determine their lactate threshold.
The swimmer’s personal best 100-meter time plus two seconds is the target
for the final swim. The six 100s should be swum at a descending pace:
Swim 1: 100 meters at +25 seconds on 2:00 minutes
Swim 2: 100 meters at +20 seconds on 2:00 minutes
Swim 3: 100 meters at +15 seconds on 2:00 minutes
Swim 4: 100 meters at +10 seconds on 2:00 minutes
Swim 5: 100 meters at +5 seconds on 2:00 minutes
Swim 6: 100 meters at +2 seconds on 2:00 minutes
The swimming variables of stroke rate, distance per stroke, free-swimming
velocity, stroke count, turn time, lap time, total time, and lactates should be
recorded for each swim. All swims are conducted in the same time interval, so
the intensity will progressively increase, as with any test set.
Starting at the personal best time plus 25 seconds, swimmers should try to
hold a consistent pace within each 100-meter swim. The first four swims allow
the athletes to pace themselves correctly at slower velocities and set themselves
up for efficient fifth and sixth swims.
A plot of these data shows how these performance variables change with
increasing speed. This information can identify the athlete’s lactate threshold
and determine whether the athlete’s stroke breaks down at any point (e.g., a rapid
rise in stroke rate without a change in speed indicates a shorter stroke length).

Recording data from the step test periodically throughout the year makes it pos-
sible to track improvement (or deterioration) and identify the most important
contributors to performance.
Stroke Efficiency
Another measure of performance is the stroke efficiency test protocol, which
is designed to develop a swimmer’s efficiency. The test involves swimming 6 ×
50-meter efforts at the pace that the swimmer holds during the second 50 meters
of a 100-meter race. The swimmer should count the number of strokes taken to
swim 50 meters, and the time for the swim should be recorded. These two values
(the stroke count and time) are added together to produce a golf handicap score.
The aim of the test is to reduce the swimmer’s golf handicap over time either
by using fewer strokes for the same time or by producing a quicker time while
using the same number of strokes.
Starts and Turns
Finally, variables associated with the start and turn, which are measured in
the race analysis of the swimmer, can also be tested on a regular basis within
training. For example, to measure the swimmer’s turn, the swimmer can be
positioned at around 20 meters out from the wall and asked to swim in to and
out of the wall while executing a turn. Starting from this distance provides the
swimmer sufficient time to reach race velocity in to the wall. To measure the
turn-in part of the turn, the coach can measure the time from when the swim-
mer’s head crosses the 5-meter backstroke flag mark until the swimmer’s feet
touch the wall. The time from feet on the wall until the swimmer’s head passes
the 5-meter window determines the turn-out time. This simple sport science
measure enables the effectiveness of the turn to be quantified within a training
session and over time. A similar process can be applied to the swimmer’s start.
Timing measures can be made at 5-, 10-, and 15-meter intervals or as specified
by the coach.
Evaluating Progression
of Adaptive Swimming
Compared with able-bodied or Olympic swimming, Paralympic swimming has
a shorter history of competition; although the first Olympic Games were held
in 1896, it wasn’t until 1960 that the first Paralympic Games were contested.
This difference in evolutionary history has resulted in a fair amount of variance
between swimmers, techniques, and tactics, a factor to be considered when
evaluating swimming performance.
This difference between Olympic and Paralympic swims is best demonstrated
by the variability of swimming performance within and between national

and international competitions. In an Olympic year, potential Olympic medal
swimmers need to improve their motor skill performance by about 1 percent
within competitions and by about 1 percent within the year leading up to the
Olympics to keep pace with the competition and give themselves a chance to
reach the podium (Pyne, Trewin, and Hopkins 2004). Athletes who are able to
obtain an additional enhancement, even one as low as about 0.4 percent between
competitions, would substantially increase their chances of a winning a medal.
In a study of Paralympic swimming that involved 15 national and inter-
national competitions between 2004 and 2006, 724 official finals times were
analyzed for 120 male and 122 female Paralympic swimmers in the 100-meter
freestyle event (Fulton et al. 2009). Separate analyses were performed for males
and females in each of four Paralympic subgroups: S2 through S4, S5 through
S7, S8 through S10 (most through least physically impaired), and S11 through
S13 (most through least visually impaired). Mixed modeling of log-transformed
times, with adjustment for mean competition times, was used to estimate vari-
ability and progression. Within-swimmer race-to-race variability, expressed as
a coefficient of variation, ranged from 1.2 percent (male S5–S7) to 3.7 percent
(male S2–S4). Swimming performance progressed by about 0.5 percent per year
for males and females alike. Typical variation in mean performance time between
competitions was about 1 percent after adjustments were made for the ability of
the athletes in each competition. The Paralympic Games were the fastest competi-
tion. Taking into account this variability, progression, and level of competition,
the bottom line is that Paralympic swimmers who want a substantial increase in
their medal prospects should aim for an annual improvement of at least 1 to 2
percent, which is higher than the current 1 percent annual improvement expected
for Olympic swimmers. In other words, Paralympic swimmers are getting faster
at a faster rate, compared with Olympic-caliber swimmers.
Other studies have been conducted over a four-year period to compare the
stroking parameters of Paralympic swimmers by analyzing 13 competitions
including the Paralympic Games, World Championships, and several national
championships (Fulton et al. 2009). In total, 442 races of 100-meter heats (225
performances) and finals (217 performances) were profiled. These studies, which
involved collecting race analysis data, showed the following:
• On average, start time correlated best with race time, showing near-perfect
correlations for classes S7 (r = 0.90), S8 (r = 0.97), and S10 (r = 0.90). This
finding is somewhat in contrast to the findings of Daly et al. (2001) for
Atlanta Paralympic heat swims, in which start time was not found to be as
important (r = 0.6 and lower for classes S7 and above).
• Turn time correlations were very high and consistent for all classes (r = 0.78
to 0.89). Finish time correlations were consistently the lowest of the three
race times for all classes, showing moderate to high correlations (r = 0.30
for class S8 to r = 0.67 for class S10). The findings for turning and finished
did coincide with results found by Daly et al. 2003.

When comparing the final race time with the stroke parameters for the dif-
ferent Paralympic classes, several relationships were found:
• Small correlations were found between race time and stroke rate in the class
S7 and S10 swimmers (r = −0.05 to −0.27), indicating that stroke rate may
not be as important as stroke length for these swimmers.
• Stroke rate correlations with race time for classes S8 and S9 were high to
very high (r = −0.51 to −0.78) indicating that high stroke rate may be opti-
mal for these classes. Classes S8 and S9 showed very small correlations for
stroke length (r < −0.13), and class S9 displayed zero correlation for fourth
25-meter stroke length. These results further highlight the importance of
high stroke rate for S8 and S9 swimmers.
• Class S7 showed moderate correlations (r = −0.42 to −0.50) and class S10 very
high correlations (r = −0.78 to −0.88) between race time and stroke length.
• Classes S8 and S9 displayed small correlations (r = 0.09 to 0.23) for first- and
second-lap stroke count, class S7 showed moderate stroke count correlations
(r = 0.51 and 0.47), and class S10 showed high stroke count correlations (r
= 0.88 and 0.84) in relation to final time.
Periodization and Tapering
The principle of providing a suitable overload stimulus followed by appropriate
recovery applies to the adaptive swimmer when designing the periodization
and seasonal training plan. As with any athlete, careful monitoring is required
to ensure that the athlete has suitable recovery between training bouts because
inappropriate loading can be detrimental to performance. Note that some athletes
with a disability may require a longer recovery period because of the complexity
of their musculoskeletal systems. This aspect is discussed with examples in the
following section.
Special Considerations for Sprint and Distance
Training
Although many of the principles of training for sprint or distance events are
similar for able-bodied and adaptive swimmers, in some situations the disability
should be considered when developing training (and race strategy) programs.
For example, consider swimmers with cerebral palsy. These swimmers gener-
ally have two distinct profiles, both of which relate directly to the severity of
the disability. For the swimmer with mild cerebral palsy, the swimming stroke
initially will be similar to the stroke of an able-bodied athlete. That is, the stroke
rate, stroke length, and overall technique will be consistent with what is seen
in an able-bodied athlete. After about 30 seconds, however, the technique will
deteriorate because of the disability. This phenomenon of deterioration in tech-
nique is common in cerebral palsy athletes, whereas for other athletes a change

--- Page 552 Text ---
|
Adaptive Swimmers 541
in technique is often related to the level of fitness. For the swimmer with mild
cerebral palsy, the level of fitness is not the critical factor in the deterioration of
technique; rather it is the consequence of the disability. The mechanism to address
this issue is to establish a lower-intensity race strategy in the earlier stages of the
race to enable the athlete to counter the effects of fatigue in the later stages of
the race. This strategy can be applied to both sprint and distance events.
For swimmers who have a more severe level of cerebral palsy, the ability to
control technique can become a challenge. Therefore, the emphasis on strictly
following a traditional swimming technique should be reduced. Rather, the
athlete and coach need to identify a stroke profile that the athlete can maintain
and explore the propulsion and resistance profile further.
Preparing for Competition
The preparation for competition is similar for able-bodied and adaptive swimmers.
One consideration is the increased anxiety and pressure that athletes face at an
international competition, because this naturally affects all swimmers. Because of
their disability, some, but only some, swimmers with cerebral palsy may be more
emotional in a stressful situation, such as competing at the World Championships
or Paralympic Games. This tension is a function of the athlete’s disability, and
knowledge of this issue can prepare the coach and support staff to deal with it
before it becomes a problem. As with all athletes, there are variations in dealing
with and managing stressful situations, and this will vary regardless of disability.
Race Analysis: Evaluating Elite Performances
Swim race analysis identifies the factors that contribute to swim performance.
When comparing one athlete’s swim with an opponent’s, these types of analyses
highlight critical performance differences. Sport scientists have used above-water
video to conduct competition race analyses at most international swimming
events since the 1988 Olympics. Variables that are commonly measured include
start, turn, and finish times, as well as 25- and 50-meter segment split times.
Using time data and segment distances from competition swimming races, clean
swimming speed, stroke rate, and stroke length at various points in a race can
be calculated. These measures provide objective insight to the coach and athlete
on what is happening within elite swimming performance.
A similar process of race analysis can be applied to adapted swimmers with
some variations. For example, for a swimmer who does not have the use of the
arms through disease or amputation, the race analysis variable of arm stroke rate
is not relevant. Using competition analysis data from all 100-meter freestyle final-
ists at the Sydney Paralympic Games, Daly et al. (2003) calculated correlations
between stroke rate, stroke length, and midpool velocity, as well as for within-race
and between-race (heat and finals) changes in these parameters. These were
their findings:

}
542 Burkett
• Races were won or lost by better maintaining velocity in the second half of
each 50-meter race. Differences in velocity between swimmers were related
more to stroke length than stroke rate.
• Within-race velocity changes were more related to changes in stroke rate.
Stroke rate changes were also responsible for velocity changes between
qualifying heats and finals in the first part of races, whereas stroke length
was responsible for better velocity maintenance at the end of races.
Other longitudinally based studies have tracked the performance of indi-
vidual swimmers from their inaugural international competition as 14-year-
olds through their Paralympic and world-record performances four years
later (Burkett and Mellifont 2008). This progression provides insight into the
differences in skill level and subsequent motor skills in swimming. As seen
in table 25.1, the individual swimmer’s performance improved 10 percent
from her swim in the finals of the 2002 World Championships to the medal
performance at the 2004 Paralympic Games. The athlete saw an additional 2.6

percent improvement in setting the world record at the 2006 World Champion-
ships. More important, these data identify the details that contribute to this
performance increase, such as stroke rate and length, segmental velocity, start
and turn times, and so forth. The key areas of improvement for this swimmer
were improved turn and finish times and better ability to pace the race evenly,
knowing that high and stable values of the stroking parameters enable a faster
swimming performance.
Examination of the race analysis for swimmers with a visual impairment
has found that limitation of visual cues does not influence race strategy,
when compared with Olympic swimmers (Burkett, Malone, and Daly 2003).
Comparisons made between Olympic and visually impaired 100-meter free-
style swimmers at the Sydney 2000 Games found no significant differences
in stroke rate between the Olympic and Paralympic swimmers (table 25.2).
Additionally, no significant difference was found between class 12 and 13
visually impaired swimmers. This research shows that for visually impaired
swimmers, the ability to see the opposition and race against them may not be
as important as employing a suitable race strategy. This finding also indicates
that the 100-meter race is relatively simple in that in the long-course event,
apparently only one strategy is used by a wide variety of swimmers who nev-
ertheless have sufficient race experience.

Nutrition for Swimmers and
Performance-Enhancing Drugs
The nutritional demands of able-bodied and adaptive swimmers are similar.
The individual athlete needs to be evaluated, and nutritional strategies need to
be developed for before, during, and after training and competition to ensure
that the nutritional needs of the swimmer are satisfied.
As with able-bodied swimmers, drug testing for illegal performance-enhancing
drugs is strictly conducted for adaptive swimmers. They are subject to the same
penalties if found guilty of using performance-enhancing drugs. All parties
involved (parents, coaches, athletes) need to be aware of the antidoping rules
and regulations, especially the procedure to file Therapeutic Use Exemption
(TUE) forms. Many adaptive swimmers take prescribed drugs that are medically
necessary. In these instances, swimmers are permitted to take the drugs, even if
they are on the banned list, as long as the prescribing physician files a TUE with
the world and national antidoping agencies.
Swimming Psychology:
Merging the Mind and Body
Like Olympic athletes, Paralympians often confront issues related to mental
preparation and performance, such as exercise adherence, motivation, and
anxiety experienced precompetition or in the middle of a major event. The
established process of proactively controlling the athlete’s mood state, visual-
ization, and precompetition thought process is of particular importance to the
outcome of the sporting performance. In most cases, the Paralympic athlete
can apply visualization processes similar to those used by the Olympic athlete,
but for athletes with some disabilities, this is not possible. In using visualiza-
tion techniques, athletes often watch a video of a past performance, usually
their best performance, to visualize the perfect race. For athletes with a visual
impairment or blindness, this approach is not possible, so they need to use
other techniques, such as hearing, or rely on their confidence in the predefined
race strategy.
Swimmers with cerebral palsy may also experience some level of intellectual
disability in addition to the physical impairments they experience. This condi-
tion could restrict their ability to use the power of the mind to modify mood
state, concentrate, or have the mental focus to develop and follow a set race
plan. Likewise, muscle relaxation techniques that are frequently used to bring
the athlete into a desired mood state (e.g., the procedure of systematically con-
tracting and relaxing muscle groups) may need to be modified for the athlete
with an amputation. With the loss of limb or a spinal cord injury, the athlete
may have limited or no ability to contract and relax systematically. The athlete
who has an intellectual disability may have a different response mechanism

to the burnout or staleness that is common in athletes following long periods
of training and competition.
Swimming Medicine:
Swimming Injuries and Prevention
Adaptive swimmers who have visual impairment, intellectual disability, or mild
cerebral palsy generally experience swimming-related injuries, such as swimmer’s
shoulder, at levels similar to those of able-bodied athletes. Injury prevention
follows the same principles of ensuring that the musculoskeletal system of the
athlete is suitably flexible and stable and that the athlete uses an appropriate
swimming technique.
For swimmers with more severe disabilities such as cerebral palsy, amputa-
tion, or spinal cord injury, the loss of function within one region can result in
overload and compensation and therefore increase injury potential. Avoiding
these issues follows the same principles for any swimmer of ensuring that the
swimmer’s musculoskeletal system is flexible and stable and that the swimmer
uses a suitable swimming technique.
Because swimmers with a spinal cord injury rely on a wheelchair for mobil-
ity, two key factors must be considered when trying to avoid injury. First, the
shoulders should not be overloaded because the athlete typically relies on the
shoulders to propel the wheelchair. (A shoulder injury will impair daily mobil-
ity as well as swimming performance.) This issue can be addressed by carefully
monitoring the athlete’s internal and external shoulder range of motion using a
regular sport science screening measure. This test will provide valuable feedback
on the intensity of both in-water and dryland training regimes. Correct sport
science assessment can prevent shoulder injury issues, but the second issue can
be more challenging to address.
The second issue relates to the fact that a swimmer may spend the majority
of the day in a wheelchair. Because of limited stimulation to the lower limbs,
athletes can develop a fixed contracture at the hips; the muscles shorten,
resulting in permanent flexion of the hip joint, potentially reaching 90 degrees
of flexion. In freestyle, breaststroke, and butterfly strokes, this fixed hip con-
tracture creates an excessive frontal drag profile that significantly affects the
swimmer. In the backstroke position, the upright fixed hip position exaggerates
body roll and further challenges the limited (or missing) abdominal control
that most athletes in this situation experience. Sport science has addressed this
issue by having the swimmer use a pull buoy when swimming in the prone
position. The floatation of the buoy in the water actively encourages extension
of the hip joint. This modification alone will not resolve the situation. Ath-
letes in wheelchairs, regardless of the sport in which they participate, should
daily extend the hip joint and stretch the hip flexor muscles to avoid a more
permanent fixed contracture. Ultimately, surgical release of the hip capsule
may be considered.

Swimming Medicine:
Illnesses and General Health
Some athletes require specific medication because of their disabilities. These
medications, such as beta-blockers, must be approved by the national and inter-
national antidoping agencies. The allowed medications generally relate to the
treatment of pressure sores, control of possible neuromuscular spasms, or asthma.
As with the wider population, a range of medications is taken to address daily
lifestyle requirements, and the adaptive swimmer can have similar requirements.
Equipment such as prostheses and wheelchairs are fundamental in allowing
some people with disabilities to carry out the tasks of daily living. Lower-limb
amputees rely on the technical attributes of their prosthetic limbs to ambulate,
and the specifications of these components have changed considerably in recent
years. Of greatest importance are the subtle compensatory factors that come
with using prostheses and that can detrimentally influence the swimmer. At
first glance, the effect of a lower-limb amputation seems to be confined to the
lower limb. But the skeletal image of an amputee identifies several compensatory
mechanisms that are employed throughout the body. The amputation alters the
orientation of the pelvis, and because the pelvis is connected to the vertebral
column, the change in pelvic angle causes scoliosis of the spine (figure 25.2). The
altered orientation of the vertebral column then causes the shoulders to change
alignment and the orientation of the skull to be altered. Thus, the compensatory
mechanisms resulting from the amputation can have far-reaching consequences
for the functional ability of the swimmer. This phenomenon highlights the need

to address activities outside the pool to provide the best opportunities for the
swimmer.
Strength and Conditioning
for Performance Enhancement
Biomechanical studies have established that asymmetry is common in the
general population and, as expected, is greater in unilateral sports. Studies that
investigated functional asymmetry in terms of swimming hand speed and hand
path found asymmetric pulling patterns. Because this asymmetry is even higher
for the swimmer with an amputation, the task for the coach is to modify or
prevent this asymmetry. For instance, an imbalance in muscular strength of the
rotator cuff can lead to fatigue, subsequently altering stroke mechanics. That, in
turn, can lead to suboptimal performance or put the athlete at a greater risk for
developing a shoulder injury. Sport biomechanics studies have also identified
subtle changes in body position in the water that can increase either the resistive
drag or the propulsive forces of the athlete.
The effect of force symmetry has been identified in front-crawl swimmers,
focused particularly on breathing laterality and symmetry of isokinetic forces of
shoulder internal rotators. Results showed increased duration of the catch–pull
phase of the dominant arm compared with when breathing on the amputated
side. Development of greater strength in the dominant arm and unilateral breath-
ing may lead to asymmetry of stroke and force output. More recently, Osborough
and colleagues (2009) examined 13 single-arm amputee international-level
swimmers for symmetry of arm coordination. All swimmers showed asymmet-
ric coordination between their affected and unaffected arm pulls. This asym-
metry did not appear to be affected by an increase in swimming velocity up to
a swimmer’s maximum. The quickest swimmers possessed more symmetrical
coordination between arms, compared with the slower swimmers. This result
suggests that pulling both the amputated arm and the intact arm through the
water with similar timing might be beneficial for front-crawl swimmers with a
single-arm amputation.
Summary
Although adaptive swimmers are taking advantage of many of the sport sciences
and methods that able-bodied swimmers are using to improve performance,
advances in Paralympic swimming can still be made in a number of areas.
Appropriate and regular feedback from the coach to the athlete is needed to
help everyone understand the factors contributing to performance and identify
areas where athlete-specific improvements can be made. Race analysis data from
competitions and recording basic performance data in training can be helpful
here.

There are opportunities to develop disability-specific equipment, particularly
for athletes with spinal cord issues and the more severely disabled swimmers,
that can help enhance performance within the rules of the sport.
Gaining a more thorough understanding of how and why the human body
moves and, as important, the factors that limit or enhance the capacity to move
is critical to any sporting performance, especially for athletes with disabilities.
What is needed is the application of the tremendous technological developments
in various spheres of human endeavor to the challenges faced by Paralympic
athletes.
An understandable temptation for researchers is to research only hot topics
that are likely to be funded through research grants. Because most people with
disabilities are older, the development of assistive devices has naturally focused
on this market. Paralympic athletes have created a new, albeit small, market.
This new market demand, in the long term, will result in better understanding
of the relationships among human biology, the biomedical aspects of disability,
the activities to be performed, and the biomechanics of assistive devices. But
there is still some way to go because the current market demand for adaptive
technology is overwhelmingly biased toward an aged population.
Additionally, authorities must strive to provide an even playing field at both
the Olympics and the Paralympics, which includes ensuring equity of access to
technology and the use of performance-enhancing substances. Developed coun-
tries have access to both the materials and the knowledge behind the technology
and therefore can modify the technology to meet their specific requirements.
But the situation is more problematic for athletes in developing countries. Future
technological developments will have far-reaching effects on Paralympic athletes.
Their new assistive anatomy with its higher level of functionality will lead not
only to improved efficiency in performing daily tasks but also to more effective
performance in the competition arena. If the guidelines that govern the use of
novel technology are too restrictive, technological development will be stifled;
alternatively, in a free-for-all environment, providing an even playing field for
all will be a challenge.
Overall, we have only scratched the surface of what we know about disabled
athletes and what works best in helping them maximize their athletic potential.
As more coaches and scientists focus on the issues facing Paralympic athletes,
including swimmers, we will continue to see improved performance.
