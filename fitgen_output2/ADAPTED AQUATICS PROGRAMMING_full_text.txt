egan is a 10-year-old girl who requires maximum physical assistance to
participate in her land-based physical education class. Because of her
lack of ability and voluntary movement on land, Megan’s caregivers believe that
Megan needs other forms of activity in order to achieve the benefits of physical
fitness. They have asked the school district for a physical education assessment
to determine if Megan is making progress in her land-based physical education
class. Her caregivers have noticed that Megan exhibits the most independence
when placed in a flotation device in her community pool. Therefore, they have
asked that the assessment include a swimming component.
During the land portion of the physical education assessment, Megan was
unable to participate in physical activities without adult intervention. She was
not able to consistently perform voluntary movements against gravity or raise
her heart rate unless physically assisted. In contrast, during the pool assessment,
by using a head/neck flotation device Megan was able to raise her heart rate
by 40 beats per minute without teacher intervention. In addition, she continually
moved her arms and legs for 9 minutes without prompting.
Because of Megan’s performance during the aquatics assessment, Megan’s
individualized education planning committee decided that in addition to physi-
cal education instruction, Megan should receive adapted aquatics instruction
at the expense of the school district.

Legislation for Individuals With
Disabilities
Federal legislation has mandated the demise of
architectural barriers and has served as a catalyst
for encouraging school and agency programming
to accommodate all members of the community. In
addition, legislation has created funding opportuni-
ties to subsidize local and state fiscal concerns for
renovating existing structures and constructing new
facilities. Individuals with disabilities not only are
more visible but also are more vocal, as the laws have
empowered them to make their own decisions and
achieve greater independence. The motto “nothing
about us, without us” has resulted in individuals with
disabilities demanding more stringent laws and land-
mark access decisions. As accommodating people
with disabilities is a rapidly developing area of the Figure 1.4 Lifts provide individuals with physical disabili-

r. Moore is the specialist in adapted aquatics for the Wright School District.
Until last spring he was an itinerant adapted physical education (APE)
teacher, visiting 12 schools across the county each week. Although he was consid-
ered a member of the school district’s multifactored team (M-team), his schedule
rarely allowed him to attend IEP meetings. He provided his assessment data and
recommendations via other team members. After a self-evaluation, the school dis-
trict placed a greater emphasis on transition services for students aged 14 and older,
and thus Mr. Moore’s position was redefined. He started to attend IEP meetings and
through collaboration with caregivers, students with disabilities, and school district
personnel helped select aquatics as an area of emphasis for all eligible students
in order to address concerns in transition services. While adapted aquatics was a
primary area of emphasis, Mr. Moore and other APE personnel provided coordi-
nated land-based adapted physical education and also emphasized lifelong leisure
skill development. Everyone understands that collaboration is an integral part of
schools, and Mr. Moore now attends regularly scheduled meetings with the district’s
M-team. His attendance has resulted in educating M-team collaborators about the
contribution of adapted aquatics as a lifelong activity for people with disabilities.
When individual collaborators attend and participate in team meetings, both team
members and students benefit from direct professional input. In this example, all
team members learned about the importance of adapted aquatics as a lifelong
leisure activity to include as a transitional component for eligible students.

Settings
The settings in which aquatics programs following
the educational model take place include schools,
community centers, and camps. Many children first
learn to swim during summer camp. Schools provide
educational adapted aquatics as part of the physical
education curriculum to replace or complement the
regular or adapted physical education class.
Sometimes when schools don’t have a facility but
an IEP calls for an educational aquatics program, the
school will subcontract with a community pool to
provide the program. When this happens, the school
will dictate that the program be geared toward the
educational model of service. The school provides
transportation to a community-based facility to fulfill
this requirement.

Mr. Colt is nervous about registering Sandy because he is not sure he wants to
divulge her disability right from the start, but he knows that Sandy needs a smaller
group with a higher teacher-to-student ratio and a patient instructor who will teach
to Sandy’s learning style and give her ongoing cues to remain on task and stay
with the group. Sandy also needs extra safety monitoring and needs the instructor
to escort her from the lesson directly to her parents’ waiting hands. Mr. Colt is also
worried that if he reveals Sandy’s disability the swim school will reject his daughter,
as other community agencies have. The instructors at the last aquatics facility he
tried said that they did not know how to teach children like Sandy. And finally,

Carter, Dolan, and LeConey (1994) have recog-
nized that individuals with disabilities possess differ-
ent levels of aquatic skills and that a continuum based
on participant skill (with inclusion as the ultimate
goal) is the model that best addresses an individual’s
assessed needs. “This approach recognized that
specific participation outcomes are influenced by
participant functioning capacity, and that the degree
of staff intervention is dependent upon participant
functioning level” (Carter et al., 1994, p. 4). Level I
includes services for individuals needing prerequisite
skills, such as increased range of motion, balance,
and tolerance of frustration, and for individuals with
fragile health needs. The student-to-teacher ratio is
low, as low as one to one, and once a participant
has acquired basic safety and aquatic skills , he
moves to level II. Level II is where individuals learn

rs. Denny had a dilemma. It seemed that her 12-year-old son was being
excluded from the 12-week swim program that all sixth graders in the
school district were participating in. The district’s aquatics staff was overwhelmed
by the notion of what Mrs. Denny’s son Ry could possibly learn since he was a
student with challenging behaviors in the autistic spectrum and was large in size
for his age. The aquatics staff members did not send the permission slip and swim
lesson notice home to Ry’s parents since they did not feel that he was able to be
involved in the swim program. They had formed this opinion of Ry while observing
him in community events and church-related programs.
When Ms. Denny protested that her son would receive the services that every-
one else in sixth grade received, an adapted aquatics specialist was called in
to conduct an assessment, suggest placement, and write goals and objectives
for inclusion in the boy’s IEP. Following a successful assessment that the adapted
aquatics consultant conducted, with Ry’s entire IEP team and parents present,
the aquatics staff apologized for the stereotype, embraced the recommenda-
tions and goals from the assessment, and formed a small group for Ry to learn in
during the swim program.

ming, knowing how to swim in a circle, using an inner
tube for flotation, and clearing the mouth of water are
examples of prerequisite skills that children without

rarely taught in a general swim curriculum. But these
are required skills and therefore might be included
in an ecologically based assessment. To assess these
skills, instructors may need to specially design their
own ecologically based assessment tools or combine
various tools such as those in appendix B.
Conducting assessments in the
educational Model
Aquatic assessments can be conducted in a variety of
ways, including an informal observation during free
swim or a more formal observation while working
with the swimmer one on one and making specific
requests. It has been shown that initial formal assess-
ments carried out by a stranger to the child may yield
less than top performance. So if you assess a partici-
pant who is not familiar with you, he may hesitate
to perform to his fullest capability. This is especially
true for frightened participants, newly injured swim-
mers, or those who are totally dependent on physical
assistance (e.g., people with quadriplegia).
When meeting the swimmer for the first time in
the water, it is always preferable to include water Figure 4.4 Steps or ramps can provide a secure spot

Program and
Organization
Development
A
swimming instructor at a local community center started an adapted
aquatics program in response to a small group of parents who had pas-
sionately persevered in their effort to find swimming lessons for their children.
Initially the program served 10 children with various disabilities and met 1 hour a
week. After 4 months, the swimming instructor added another weekly session to
accommodate 12 more children. After 6 months, the instructor had a waiting list
that included 20 more children. In order to have sufficient instructors, parents and
other volunteers were recruited and trained to assist with swimming lessons.
The executive director of the community center became increasingly aware
of the additional resources needed to maintain the program. However, the com-
munity need was great, parental support was high, and everyone involved was
committed to maintaining the program. More time was spent recruiting, training,
and organizing volunteers. Instructional equipment was needed, so grants were
solicited from local companies and foundations. Parents started to organize and
discuss other issues regarding services for their children. Scheduling with facilities
became increasingly difficult as other courses and community groups competed
for pool time. Plans were also made to develop a 2-week summer camp and to
further expand the current program in the coming year.

aye was a first-year university student who wanted to swim for fitness but had
problems accessing the pool, deck, lockers, showers, and dressing areas due
to use of a wheelchair. It was not that she was unable to independently operate
a door, locker, or hydraulic chair lift; it was that the design of the pool, lockers, and
lift did not allow for independent use. She had concerns about the accessibility of
the pool and its locker facilities after arriving for a recreation swim the first week
of classes. She found that the accessible locker room was also the swim team
room and was locked. She wheeled herself onto the pool deck to get a look at
the pool, only to find that the accessible lift was a 25-year-old, rusty, manual sling
seat lift that could not be operated independently. When at first she did not see
the lift, the lifeguard told her that it happened to be propped in a closet due to
a swim meet that was conducted the weekend before, as it was “sort of in the
way,” being so close to the warm-up pool.
There was no other means of pool entry for a person who used a wheelchair

she have to find the aquatics director or the lifeguard for that? What about the
spirit of the ADA and its push for independence in the pool? How would she feel
about the lifeguard cranking the sling seat lift every time for her to enter and exit

wheelchairs. Especially at risk are individuals with
neuromuscular disorders who use a power wheel-
chair or crutches. The anxiety caused by being on
a narrow, crowded pool deck is enough to elevate
an already abnormally high muscle tone. Fears of
running into an obstacle or maneuvering through
narrow spots or close to the water’s edge add to the
tension. Such trepidation, compounded by poor deck
maintenance, could cause an accident, such as an
individual inadvertently driving her wheelchair into
people, obstacles, or the pool. Individuals who have
poor balance or use crutches, walkers, or canes are
especially at risk when a pool deck is narrow or clut-
tered. Osinski reports that “slip-and-fall accidents are
the most common reasons for lawsuits being filed in

pounds (2.3 kilograms) or less of force. Lifts require
little deck and pool space, but should stay in place to
provide easy access and to reduce the risk of damage
that comes from constantly moving them. They vary
in price from approximately 900 to thousands of U.S.
dollars. The most elaborate lift costs $12,000 U.S.
and actually lifts the entire wheelchair into the water.
Most lifts require some type of pool deck modifica-
tion. Some decks, however, have a permanent sleeve
with a portable lift. When using a removable device,
you must leave it in place until all participants have
exited the pool. When the lift is not in place, a sign
must be posted instructing potential users on how to
ask for assistance with the lift (National Center on
Accessibility, 1996).
When discussing whether your facility should have
a movable or permanent lift, your facility staff and
pool operator must address the following concerns:
• Is the pool outdoors? If so, the exposure to the
sun, wind, and rain can diminish the overall life
of the equipment (Ostby & Skulski, 2004).
• Is there a possibility of a risk management issue
due to the lift being an attractive nuisance? Is
there a good chance people will use it in an
unauthorized manner? Figure 6.7 Portable devices may take up excessive
deck space, yet provide access in a variety of locations.

• If the lift is permanent, will it be exposed to
chemicals and humidity that may compromise
its integrity?
• Do you have a lot of temporary staff? If the lift
is movable, will all staff know how to safely
install it and perform all the associated safety
checks?
• Will people with disabilities really be inde-
pendent if the lift is movable? Is it desirable for
people who need the lift to have to ask for it to
be put in every time they want to swim?
• If the lift is battery powered, who will recharge
it for ready use?
• What are the implications for constantly remov-
ing and reinstalling the lift in terms of constant
handling and finding storage in a place that
does not compromise its structure (i.e., not the

mers with muscular dystrophy), full-body flotation
devices for swimmers with quadriplegia or severe
multiple disabilities, and handheld flotation devices
for assisting balance while water-walking. Flotation
devices also help keep the ears out of the water for
participants with serious ear problems. Specially
designed swimsuits by Speedo and other companies
provide in-suit inflation bladders to support the
swimmer. Because flotation devices help support,
stabilize, and facilitate movement, they may open
a new world to individuals with mobility impair-
ments, allowing freedom of movement not possible
on land. In addition to flotation suits, other devices
you might use under close supervision include swim
belts, bubbles, and squares, many of which come with
modules to increase or decrease flotation. Foam rafts
offer fun and relaxation as well as a central place to
play in the pool. They are more durable than blow-up
rafts and can support more weight. Water logs, also
known as water noodles or woggles, are hefty, flex-
ible buoyant logs that encourage water exploration
and fun kicking.
While flotation devices are useful, they pose sev-
eral problems for individuals with disabilities. For
example, they may impair independence if swim-
mers rely on them too long after they should have
progressed to unaided swimming. Dunn describes
more severe problems in the article “PFDs for the

Support Equipment and Supplies
Flotation devices, including personal flotation devices
(PFDs), water wings, pull buoys, wet vests, dumbbell
floats, and sectional rafts, give you an extra hand
when you are working with individuals who depend
on others to stay above the water (see figure 6.11).
Flotation devices can add an element of safety,
eliminate fear, provide support, and help participants
maintain a level position in the water (Heckathorn,
1980). Flotation devices should be selected to fit the
swimmer’s ability, range of motion, strength, buoy-

arla learned to swim at an ea rly age and developed into a water rat. She
participated in an ever-expanding world of aquatic activities until her life’s
path was altered due to a spinal cord injury sustained in an automobile accident.
After her rehabilitation, she decided to move her life forward and enrolled in a
local state university. One day Carla’s roommate discussed Carla with her univer-
sity water aerobics instructor. They approached Carla about joining their class as
a means to reconnect with her favorite activity and to increase her socialization.
Carla resisted with a list of excuses including her disability, body image in the
locker room, and perception that everyone would stare at her in the pool due
to her disability and hygiene appliances. The instructor showed her the changing
room for people with special needs and allowed her to simply observe the class.
She felt comfortable with an alternate changing area and soon discovered that,
due to the buoyancy of the water, she could perform many of the movements
performed in class. With her instructor’s encouragement, combined with architec-
tural and program accessibility, she began to participate in campus recreation
and community swimming and water-related activities. She continues to take on
new challenges and confronts the future as opposed to dwelling on the past.

pits, shoulders, and head (see figure 7.12). This posi-
tion also helps protect the rescuer from being hit if the
individual’s arms or head flail during a seizure. Pro-
vide only the support needed to keep the individual’s
face out of the water, as unnecessary restraint may
cause injury to both individual and rescuer. Do not
attempt to remove the individual from the pool until
the seizure has subsided. However, do not allow the
individual to remain in the pool if the seizure lasts
for more than several minutes or continues in rapid
succession, if injury or hypothermia occurs, or if the a
person needs CPR.
To remove a participant from the pool, several
rescuers or aides can lift the individual from the water.
You can direct a simple lift by having the rescuers
stand on one side of the individual, roll the individual
toward their chests, and lay the individual on a mat or
towels on the side of the pool (see figure 7.13, a-c).

Instructional
Strategies
O
n the first day of school, the new aquatics teacher was excited to finally open
a new high school natatorium and to meet her new students. However, during
her very first class something odd caught her eye. One of the students sitting in
the bleachers had a dog! The teacher introduced herself to the student, who
was named Sally, and stated that she had two problems. One, the dog was not
allowed on the pool deck, and two, it wasn’t safe for a student who was blind to
take the aquatics class. Sally informed her school APE teacher and her parents
of the embarrassing episode. A meeting of all parties was quickly assembled. The
aquatics instructor was informed of the definition of a reasonable accommoda-
tion and that the guide dog would be allowed on deck. The instructor was also
told that Sally’s mother was on the school board and was not pleased that her
daughter was denied access to the natatorium she had supported. Sally was
allowed to continue with the class. The APE teacher agreed to consult with the
aquatics instructor to assist with instructional strategies, including the appropriate
use of a tap stick, stroke counts, and environment changes (Sally swims in the
lane next to the deck, allowing the instructor to reach her with a tap stick and
giving Sally easy access to pool ladders). The aquatics teacher agreed to take
the AAPAR Adapted Aquatics Instructor course. The instructor has learned much
from Sally and other students with disabilities and now coaches several students
who are blind and working toward USABA competition.

Psychological Factors Affecting
Learning
Each person is psychologically unique, with a per-
sonal learning rate that depends on a number of
psychological factors. As an aquatics instructor, you
assist the participant through the learning process by
using different styles of teaching (ARC, 2004a, p. 21).
Individuals with disabilities may have psychological
characteristics that hinder the acquisition of aquatic
skills. You should examine psychological factors such
as anxiety, motivation for learning, cognitive readi-
ness, social ability, and preferred learning modality
before developing instructional strategies.
anxiety
Anxiety is an uneasiness or a distress felt about an
activity. It stems from elevated fear levels and inhibits

spread out; when individuals are climbing out of the
pool; or when participants are crying or whining.
When these things happen, quickly judge the situ-

teaching style too participant driven for the group or
the individual to handle? Was the equipment too large
or too small? Are participants spending too much
waiting for turns and attention? Is the class size too
large for the abilities of the students? Are the partici-
pants working at their own levels or trying skills that
are too easy or too hard for them?”
The participants signal to you that it’s time for a
change. “Now what?” you may ask. Calmly bring
the group in close, redirect them, and move on to
another part of the lesson or substitute another, more
appropriate activity. Setting a prearranged signal for
the respectful reassembly of the class during the initial
meeting with the group is a positive and proactive
strategy for addressing problems. Use signals such

EHAVIORAL INTERVENTION

es cs i i cs ee

The following information, taken from Physical
Education for the Severely Handicapped: A
Systematic Approach to a Data-Based Gym-
nasium (Dunn, Morehouse, & Fredericks, 1986),
is one model of behavior management and
instruction that you can apply directly to the
physical activity setting. This model, entitled
the DBG Program, can help you understand
the kind of consistency needed when working
with a person who has a brain injury, intellec-
tual disability, or behavior disorder.

EXAMPLE CORRECTION PROCEDURE
OF THE DBG PROGRAM

Give a verbal cue such as, “Jim, kick your
legs.” If participant responds properly, give
strong positive reinforcement and move
on. If the participant gives an improper or
no response, give a mild negative state-
ment such as, “No, Jim.” Then say, “Watch
me,” and go to the next step.

Model the desired behavior (give a visual
cue), and then repeat the verbal cue. If
the participant responds properly, give
mild positive reinforcement and move on.

that Dylan, who she knew from his participation in APE, had a negative X-ray for

whole range of disabilities that affect sight,
from problems with distance and peripheral
vision to color blindness and double vision.
Although visual perception problems may
be considered a visual impairment, in this
section we focus on visual acuity problems,
while we discuss visual perception deficits
in the next section. Several terms describe
an individual’s degree of sight and visual
acuity. Total blindness and legal blindness are
two of the more frequently used terms. Total
blindness refers to individuals who cannot
see light, forms, or shapes. These individu-
als learn through kinesthetic experiences,
listening, and braille. Individuals with legal
blindness have some usable vision (20/200
or worse in the better eye with correction
or a field of vision of less than 20°). These
individuals can see bright objects, shapes,
and figures that have a distinct outline and
are within their sight range.
Teaching Tips
• Adapt visual demonstrations by pro-
viding tactile demonstrations with
detailed directions. Encourage indi-
viduals who are not totally blind (those
with residual vision) to make full use
of the vision they have. Wear a black

amie is a 35-year-old female with spastic cerebral palsy. Fifteen years ago,
while a sophomore at Wright State University (WSU), she became involved
in the adapted aquatics program. During her initial interview with the adapted
aquatics instructor, she revealed her fear of the water due to a previous aquatics
experience that occurred much earlier in her life and that involved low instructor
expectations and poor pedagogy techniques.
Jamie and her instructor set two lifelong goals. They agreed that when she
graduated from WSU, she would be an independent swimmer and she would
possess the knowledge and courage to access a pool regardless of where she
lived.
Jamie and her instructor broke down her broad goals into smaller objective
components. The initial objectives centered on the instructor building credibility
and Jamie building her confidence. Jamie agreed to (a) regularly attend the
adapted aquatics sessions, (b) sit on the pool deck with her feet in the water, (c)
converse with other participants, and (d) watch the instructor work with other
participants. The instructor desired for Jamie to take control of her own decision
making and engineered rest periods for the students, allowing Jamie to confi-
dentially converse with them. After several visits Jamie decided to enter the pool,
exercise, and socially interact. She continued to exercise and dedicate herself to
becoming an independent swimmer regardless of where she lived.

Enhancing Flexibility:
Adaptations and Issues
Flexibility is the ability to move a joint through its

are various methods of developing flexibility, includ-
ing active (static or ballistic), passive, and combined
(Norm & Hanson, 1996). Flexibility is important for
activities of daily and athletic performance.
Aquatic exercise improves ROM in joints. Poor
ROM of the shoulder, neck, elbow, wrist, hip, or
ankle can make it harder for an aquatics participant to
improve fitness, because flexibility affects the ability
to add resistance during the power phase of a swim
stroke and to recover the arms above the water.
Aquatic exercise is valuable for improving ROM
in specific populations for which ROM is limited by
disuse, disease, or disability. Buoyancy, warmth, and
resistance are appealing attributes of this exercise

Program Selection
T
he Dickinson Family Counseling and Support Center has been receiving
requests from client families for access to an adapted aquatics swimming
program. The staff recreation coordinator has been assigned to locate or develop
an appropriate program. She realizes that several community-based organizations
have potential aquatics programs. However, she also knows that members of the
client families include individuals with diverse physical and cognitive disabilities.
Since the client families have limited resources, program accessibility and afford-
ability are important considerations. Her concern now is to select the best program
or programs that will meet the needs of the center’s clients.

residential Programs: Mary Campbell Center
The Mary Campbell Center (MCC) is a private facility that serves approximately 50 adults with severe
physical impairments. The MCC philosophy views individuals as residents and family members, not
as clients. Residents have access to a range of social, recreational, therapeutic, and daily care
services. The aquatics facility includes a 15- 3 32-foot (4.6- 3 9.8-meter) pool with a hydraulic floor,
an 8- 3 10-foot (2.4- 3 3.0-meter) spa with a hydraulic lift, fully accessible showers and locker rooms,
a laundry facility adjacent to the deck, and a fitness area with weights and aerobic exercise equip-
ment. Program personnel include five aquatics staff members with training in physical education,
recreation, and aquatics; volunteers; and ancillary PTs, OTs, and nurses.
The aquatics program provides each individual the support and skills necessary to achieve
maximum independence and freedom of movement. The program focuses on establishing a safe
environment for all participants; promoting independence, growth, and opportunities for new
experiences; providing structured exercise and carryover from physical and occupational therapy
regimens; and teaching swimming skills. All these endeavors increase participant self-esteem.
Staff members individualize all programs by focusing on specific instructional, recreational,
therapeutic, and social needs. They make comprehensive individual assessments, with input and
recommendations from professionals in physical therapy, occupational therapy, and physical
development. Staff members assess participants one on one to determine aquatic skill level and
then make recommendations at routine IAPP meetings.
To implement the aquatics program, staff members or volunteers work one on one with most
individuals and collect data from each session to provide feedback on participants’ progress. Each
session consists of a review of the skill and its components, practice, and application.
The following praise from three residents and one parent demonstrates how the pool program
has become an integral part of their lives: “The pool makes me feel better.” “I love to swim and then
go to the hot tub.” “My pool exercises make me stronger.” “My family and I watched my brother’s
face give way from slight trepidation to pure delight! The pool therapy opened up a whole new
world to him.”
Mary Campbell Center offers a residential aquatics program.

School-Based Programs: Osborn aquatic Center
The Osborn Aquatic Center is an indoor community pool that the Corvallis School District uses to
provide adapted aquatics programs as part of its special education services. The program strives
to provide an environment in which individuals with physical or intellectual disabilities can partici-
pate regardless of their limitations. Staff members encourage an atmosphere of acceptance and
personal challenge, emphasizing activities that increase strength, endurance, and water skills.
Participants encourage and help one another through peer tutoring. The director of the adapted
aquatics program designs a specific program for each student, basing it on the participant’s physi-
cal abilities and limitations and taking into account input offered by the school district’s physical
therapist and by the participant’s classroom teachers and parents. Programs might include assisted
stretching, assisted walking, swimming with and without flotation devices, group activities, and free
time to explore and play.
Students are bused to the Osborn Aquatic Center throughout the day, 5 days a week. Their
disabilities include cerebral palsy, autism, mental retardation (currently referred to as intellectual
disability), Down syndrome, Prader-Willi syndrome, and developmental and emotional delays.
Osborn Aquatic Center provides a school-based aquatics program.

personality that positioned him for a lifelong change. When his friends beckoned
him while he was cruising past a local hangout, he parked his car and waited at

Numerous public and professional organizations have
declared publicly that aquatics programs should be
given priority in educational, recreational, and com-
petitive venues. In a position paper on high school
aquatics, the Council for Aquatic Professionals within
AAHPERD states that
aquatics should be an important part of each high

an individual’s physical fitness but also establishes
framework for an active leisure pursuit appropriate

Federal legislation has also contributed signifi-

community environments. The following sections

Concerns about stroke mechanics and propulsion
exist in swimmers with impairments to trunk, hip, and
leg function. These swimmers, such as people with
spina bifida, spinal cord injuries, or polio, may have
intense arm power with no power in their legs, which
may cause stroke imbalance or excessive swaying of
the hips and legs or both. This affects hydrodynamics,
causing drag and poor streamlining. Lack of leg power
can also be a problem for swimmers who are doing

The Water Orientation Checklists
Directions for the Water Orientation Checklist—Basic (WOC-B)
The following 13 items are assessed using a five-choice rating scale. The observer records only success-
ful performances by circling an “s” on the appropriate level of the rating scale. Rating scale choices use
the following abbreviations and operational definitions:
• Spontaneous (SP): the subject performs one of the 13 tasks prior to an instructor’s verbal direc-
tions.
• Verbal (VB): the subject performs the specified task after the instructor’s verbal directions.
• Verbal with demonstration (DMO): the subject performs the specified task after the instructor’s
verbal directions and visual cues.
• Physical guidance (PG): the instructor manipulates the subject’s body through the specified task;
verbal directions and visual cues accompany manipulation.
• Objection (OBJ): the subject is unwilling to attempt the task either passively or actively.
Directions for the Water Orientation Checklist—Advanced (WOC-Adv)
The following 13 items are assessed by recording both successful and unsuccessful performances on
each level of the five-choice rating scale. For each item it is possible to record several unsuccessful per-
formances prior to recording a successful performance. The observer records performance by circling
one or more abbreviations. The following abbreviations and operational definitions are used:
• Successful (s): the subject performs the task as defined.
• Unsuccessful (u): the subject demonstrates an overt motor response in which he or she attempts
but fails to perform the specified task.
• Passive objection (p): the subject fails to attend to the task, says “no,” or shows no overt motor
response.
• Active objection (a): the subject pulls away, runs away, throws a tantrum, abuses self, yells, or
screams.

Games and Activities
for Various Age Groups
305

--- Page 318 Text ---
6-36 Months Old
Going to the Market
Materials Three dozen pieces of plastic fruit (one dozen of three different kinds), three hoops,
laminated pictures of the fruits you have.
Goals 1. To increase familiarity with water by taking their minds off where they are
2. To improve ability to get child’s hands off caregiver and reach out for something
3. To improve sense of group
4. To increase comfort on stomach
5. To develop ability to sort by color, shape, and size
How to Play Have parent-child pairs scatter around shallow, buoyed-off area. Anchor or hold three
hoops by a wall and place a laminated picture above each tube of one of the plastic
fruits that are available in the game. Spread fruit around water and ask caregivers to
hold participants at their side facing forward and have children make progress toward
fruit with caregiver gliding them along with face above the water, on their stomach,
encouraging them to kick or use arm stroke. Once child has grabbed a fruit, have
caregiver name it. Have child drop fruit into hoop with the corresponding picture
above it and repeat the process with two other kinds of fruit.
Tip Hold child’s bottom slightly lower (three to four inches) than shoulders so child’s head
stays more naturally above water.
Adaptations For students who cannot grasp an object that large, put fruit in a knee-high stocking
and tie top so child can grasp stocking top. For students who are visually impaired,
use opportunity to describe fruits, have child reach into hoop first to feel if it matches,
or instead of using fruit, use toys with various sounds.
Water the Garden
Materials 1 small plastic watering can per pair, 12 various fake flowers stuck into the pool gutter
or lane lines
Goal To improve water orientation
How to Play Start with child/adult pairs in a circle, having them bob up and down to shoulders
singing a song about rain, flowers, or the like. Use a watering can to wet children’s
feet, caregiver’s shoulders, and so on. Now give each pair a watering can and have
everyone water a flower. At each flower, have caregiver gradually pour water on
child’s various body parts.
Tip Don’t have caregiver pour water on face until child feels very comfortable about
having water on neck, chin, and back of head.
Adaptation For those who cannot perform without independence, caregiver or instructor should
provide physical assistance for using the watering can.
Magic Carpet Ride
Materials One kickboard per child
Goals 1. To improve head control
2. To develop confidence in prone position
3. To introduce kicking
4. To explore pool
How to Play Have each caregiver position child’s arms and upper body on kickboard, holding the
child onto the board. Encourage caregivers to use various speeds of gliding, push off
the wall by placing child’s feet on wall, and even introduce the flutter kick. Have care-
306

--- Page 319 Text ---
givers go to various places in the pool where there is a laminated picture of children’s
favorite characters (e.g., Mickey Mouse, Big Bird, or Sponge Bob). After they visit,
have them continue the magic carpet ride, kicking and gliding to another location.
Tip Show each caregiver how to hold child and kickboard, depending on child’s body
control and comfort in the water.
Adaptations Place action figures near pictures for those with poor eyesight to feel. Those with more
severe physical disabilities may need to wear a tube or life jacket.
Rubber Duckie
Materials Tape player with Sesame Street song “Rubber Duckie” playing (record it about five
times in a row), 1 floating duckie with a short (4 in.) ribbon (not string) around its neck
per child
Goal To increase comfort lying on back
How to Play Place ducks in gutter. Have caregiver hold child so that they are facing the gutter with
child’s back to caregiver’s chest, head near shoulder. Have pair walk backward to
other side of pool once the child has grabbed the duck’s ribbon, happily giving the
duck a ride while singing “Rubber Duckie.” Have caregiver gradually begin to squat
down in water until after a few laps of duck-walking, the child is reclining on adult’s
shoulder. Child can also place duck on the chest or adult can hold it above child to
encourage the child to lie on his back.
Tip Watch out for ribbons near children’s necks and mouths; remove ribbons from ducks’
necks for free play.
Adaptation Use ducks that squeak to motivate all students and to help visually impaired students.
3-5 Years Old
The Team Is in the Huddle
Materials None
Goal To imitate water orientation skills
How to Play Form a circle in water where children can stand, or have aides hold the children
facing the middle of the circle. Pick one child to be the captain for each time the
game starts, until all the children have had a turn. The game starts by each person put-
ting one hand in the middle of the circle so there is a pile of hands (like a team does
before they play). The group chants the cheer “The team is in the huddle; the captain’s
at the head; they all got together; and this is what he [or she] said. . . .” The captain
then says a skill or demonstrates a skill (or both) that everyone has to try to do, to the
best of their abilities. After about 10 seconds of trying, have the group come back in
together, each person putting one hand in the middle again, and you pick another
captain. Begin the chant again and continue the game until all have had a chance to
be the captain.
Tip Encourage children to do whatever they can to approximate the skill that the captain
is demonstrating.
Adaptations Give children who have problems processing information quickly a warning when
they are going to be captain, so they have time to think of a skill. Help children with
severe cognitive problems demonstrate a skill (like splashing their hand or foot, or
jumping up and down). Children with poor range of motion or no hands can put their
elbow or foot in the middle of the circle of hands, or put their hand on their assistant’s
arm and the assistant puts own hand in the circle.

London Bridge
Materials Foam noodles
Goals To practice creative and individual swimming
How to Play Hold one end of a foam noodle and put the other end on the deck. Encourage swim-
mers to swim under the noodle in any manner they wish or in a way you call out. Sing
“London Bridge” as all are going under the noodle and then swimming around your
back to go under again.
Tips Putting two noodles together with a foam attachment is easiest. Keep a lookout for
those swimming around your back. Bridge can go up and down closer to the water as
needed.
Adaptations Allow physical assistance or flotation device for those who need it. Eliminate singing
for those who can’t hear. Allow touching of your back (for orientation) and the noodle
for those who can’t see.
6-8 Years Old
Birthday Party
Materials Corks, several Styrofoam rings, reaching pole, one kickboard per child
Goals 1. To improve breath control
2. To improve flutter kick
3. To improve underwater swimming skills
How to Play Part One: “Make a Cake.” Split group in half on either side of the pool in the water,
each participant holding a kickboard. On signal, have participants kick toward the
middle and then stop and pile kickboards on each other until the group makes a
“layer cake.”
Part Two: “Blow Out the Candles.” Replace layer cake of kickboards with one Styro-
foam ring for every three children. Balance the corks on the ring. After students sing
“Happy Birthday,” have them blow the corks off the ring, like candles, and then place
their mouths in the water to try to blow corks out of the ring.
Part Three: “Limbo.” Use reaching pole to do limbo dance. Place pole as far into or
out of the water as participant ability allows. Ask students to do whatever movement
they want, a different one for each pass under the pole. Challenge with questions such
as “Who can let their feet go first?”
Tip Use limbo music for extra motivation and fun.
Adaptation Allow individuals with visual impairment to feel bar.
Escape Hatch
Materials One hoop for every two children
Goals 1. To improve underwater swimming
2. To increase spatial awareness
3. To increase independent water movement
How to Play Start with half the group in a circle holding a hoop between each person, at all differ-
ent levels—some hoops touching bottom, some mid-depth of water, and others half
out of the water. In the middle of the circle, have the other half of the group perform
some swim skills commensurate with each individual’s ability (such as bobbing) in the
middle of the circle. When you say “Escape hatch!” have all in the middle head for a
hoop of their choice and swim through it. Then have them swim around the outside
of the circle until you give the signal again. Repeat the process from the outside of
the circle to get back inside the circle. Periodically, switch two hoop holders at a time
308

--- Page 321 Text ---
with swimmers, for maximum participation. Encourage participants to swim through
as many different hoops as they will challenge themselves with.
Tip Hoop holders can move in a circle during the game.
Adaptations Individuals who cannot swim can walk, jog, or be pulled through the hoop while in a
PFD. Have those who are nonverbal and cannot swim point to the hoop they want to
try and then assist them.
Musical Hoops
Materials One hoop per person, music that can be stopped and started
Goals 1. To develop cooperation
2. To develop confidence submerging
3. To develop independence and confidence moving in pool without holding the edge
How to Play Spreads hoops around shallow (or for advanced class, deep) end. Have participants
walk or swim around until music stops. Then have them find a hoop and swim into it
from underwater. To make this an even more cooperative game, remove several hoops
and have participants share hoops when the music stops.
Adaptations For students with visual impairment, allow them to touch hoops or direct them toward
an empty hoop. For students who are hard of hearing or deaf, wave flag or cloth or
clap while music is on. For students with mobility difficulties, offer support (aide or
PFD) to swim or walk.
9-11 Years Old
Backstroke Flag Touch
Materials Backstroke flags
Goals 1. To encourage shoulder extension while on back
2. To improve arm recovery in back crawl
How to Play String several rows of backstroke flags to within two feet of water surface. Have every-
one swim on back, trying to touch the backstroke flags with each recovery of arms.
Tips Group faster students together so they don’t crash backward into slower swimmers.
Have faster swimmers complete more widths.
Adaptations Suspend bells for visually impaired swimmers. Suspend one row of flags lower for
those with short arms or limited range of motion. Offer flotation devices or physical
support or both to those who need it.
Chariot Race
Materials One tube or ring buoy per pair
Goal To develop bottom arm strength and propulsive skills for sidestroke
How to Play Conduct this activity in neck-deep or deeper water. Have one person in each pair tow
(with the hand that would be the top arm in the sidestroke) the other who is sitting in
a tube. Stress using free arm to do the movements of the lower arm in the sidestroke.
Have pairs switch at a designated point.
Tip Attach a short rope to tube for those who have trouble towing.
Adaptations Place individuals with visual impairment near the lane line to keep oriented. For an
individual with physical disabilities who cannot tow and swim at same time or who
uses a PFD, use bungee cord to connect tube to PFD, shorten distance, allow more
time, have instructor help pull, or allow another more appropriate movement instead
of sidestroke.

Are We There Yet?
Materials A large floating foam mat or several foam tubes
Goals 1. To develop leg muscle endurance
2. To develop flutter kick
How to Play Place evenly strong participants on each side of a mat or tube with their upper bodies
draped on it. On signal, have them kick as hard as they can for 30 seconds. Rest and
repeat. It is fun to try to move the mat toward the group on the other side of the mat.
Tips If the game is getting competitive, stand on one side of the mat to hold on, evening
the odds. Or have all the students try to move the mat from one side of the pool to the
other.
Adaptations Put PFD around person with poor head control to act as a head prop. Also stay near
this person.
Poison
Materials Floating objects, such as kickboards, balls, hoops, and tubes (about 5 per participant
in a cordoned-off area)
Goals 1. To improve direction changing
2. To increase alertness when swimming
How to Play Designate all floating items as poison. Have students perform various skills for the
width of the pool and avoid the poison.
Adaptations Use some floating objects that have bells in them. Have an aide tap person with visual
impairment when poison is near. Place some anchored poisons near wall and have
visually impaired swim close to wall.
12-14 Years Old
Rolling Log
Materials None
Goals 1. To improve turning over from back to front
2. To improve motionless front float
3. To improve front crawl or breaststroke speed
How to Play Mark off spaces at opposite ends of the deep end for two goals. Have one player, the
“log,” float on back in the center of the pool midway between the two goals. Have
the other players swim in a circle around the log, who without warning suddenly
rolls over and chases them. Encourage players to try to reach one of the goals without
being tagged. Those caught must join the first log in the center, and when the first log
rolls over, help tag others.
Tips In general, slower swimmers need an equalizer in order to catch someone. Having
those in the circle of swimmers swim underwater can help slow the faster swimmers
down a bit.
Adaptations For students with visual impairment in the group, have log yell “log over,” and you
yell “goal” from the goal area several times for orientation. For students with poor
swim skills, a PFD could be helpful as well as a shorter distance to the goal. Students
with no propulsive skills can grab onto a string in their lap and hold onto it while you
pull them to goal.

Surfin’ USA
Materials One blow-up raft per student (slightly underinflated), tape player with song “Surfin’
USA” by the Beach Boys, diving bricks on the bottom of pool at the halfway point
Goal To improve front crawl and butterfly
How to Play Play “Surfin’ USA” on tape player. Have participants start out lying on raft at one end
of the pool. In waves of three, have them do front crawl arms to a location marked
with a brick on bottom of pool 10 yards away, then surf on raft for 30 seconds, then
resume front crawl arm stroke to other end while next wave begins. Repeat with but-
terfly arms, then flutter and dolphin kicks.
Tips Do not allow students to surf in lanes closest to walls. Do not allow standing surfing in
shallow water. Do not allow diving off the raft.
Adaptations Allow individuals to be creative in surfing (e.g., sit-surfing, knee-surfing, supine-
surfing). For individuals with poor range of motion that limits their ability to reach over
the sides of the raft, use thinner raft or fold sides of raft under and clip.
Strike a Pose
Materials Music that can be started and stopped
Goals 1. To improve stationary sculling
2. To improve treading water
3. To improve motionless float
How to Play Have participants swim in a circle in deep end while music is on; when music is off,
have them strike a pose either treading water, stationary sculling, or floating motion-
lessly. When music is on again, have them swim.
Adaptations Individual with poor vision can swim perimeter of area and stay close to wall and lane
line or have a buddy next to them. You can tap the shoulder of hard-of-hearing or deaf
swimmer with a reaching pole that has a tennis ball impaled on one end. For those
with poor swim skills, allow PFDs and allow them to use the stroke they need the most
work on.
