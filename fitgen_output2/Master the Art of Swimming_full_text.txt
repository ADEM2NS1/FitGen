IN PRAISE OF SWIMMING
An open mind, a swimming pool or stretch of calm water and this book
are all you need to realize your untapped potential for freedom of
movement with the Shaw Method. Prepare to embark on an amazing
journey of self-discovery. In the rhythmic movements of swimming, free
from the downward pressure of gravity, you can discover the ultimate
form of meditation. Swimming is the supreme form of exercise for mind,
body and spirit – as well as improving flexibility and tone it will also
boost your self-esteem and sense of well-being. Whatever challenges you
face in life, swimming always helps: when you are stressed it relaxes you,
when you are exhausted it revitalizes you, and when your muscles are stiff
it releases them. Forget Prozac – the remedy is in H 0!

Exercise fads come and go, but swimming always remains at the top of
the popularity charts. The psychological benefits of immersion, rather
than the knowledge that swimming is good for joints and muscles, keep
millions of people switched on to swimming. It is an ideal antidote to our
pressured lives, offering a rare opportunity to rejuvenate the body while
allowing the mind to rest.
The verb ‘to swim’ is defined as ‘the ability to propel oneself through
water’, whereas the noun ‘swimming’ is generally defined as ‘a
competitive sport’. The competitive perspective is so pervasive that even
the Oxford English Dictionary describes swimming purely in terms of
being a sport. This attitude is extremely limiting. As long as you gauge
your performance in the water by the number of laps you swim or
whether you arrive at the end of the pool before the next person, there is
little chance of discovering the riches water has to offer.

--- Page 8 Text ---
It is, however, important to acknowledge that a competitive outlook has
been vital to the remarkable evolution of swimming. Without the
motivation to go faster, human beings would probably still swim like
other land-based mammals, using what is essentially a form of walking.
Competition has led us to develop four ingenious ways of moving through
the water: breaststroke, backstroke, front crawl and butterfly. Man’s
ability to swim well also derives from certain unique physical
characteristics. Only human babies, born with subcutaneous fat, can float
and swim from birth. Of all primates, only humans have a descended
larynx, allowing us to easily take in air through the mouth when
swimming.
What differentiates the approach outlined here from others is that it
draws on the Alexander Technique. The Technique’s central idea is that
the relationship between head, neck and back determines the quality of
the body’s overall coordination. When the neck is free and the head
balances lightly at the top of the spine we are able to function more
efficiently; when it is tense and the vertebrae are compressed our
functioning is adversely affected. My years of experience have confirmed
that the head-neck-back relationship is of utmost importance and that
improving this relationship is the single most significant factor affecting
swimming performance.
We are now entering a new phase in the evolution of swimming. This
book will help you transcend the competitive mindset and recraft each
stroke to promote the optimum use of the self. This approach to
swimming is closer to a martial art than a competitive sport – winning or
losing are mere distractions from an ongoing journey towards self-
mastery. Water is an ideal environment for self-development; it amplifies
psychophysical patterns, providing the opportunity to become aware of
how thoughts affect quality of movement. Swimming is unlike any other
physical activity: apart from needing to coordinate the whole body in the
horizontal plane, you also have to be in tune with the water. If you try
hard and apply too much effort you will flounder; swimming gracefully is
more about letting go and going with the flow than it is about pushing

--- Page 9 Text ---
more about letting go and going with the flow than it is about pushing
yourself.
To the evolved or enlightened swimmer, there are a number of ways of
measuring one’s performance. Speed is just one indicator, but no more
significant than, for example, the distance travelled per stroke or the
relative energy expended. A master of swimming never compromises a
good body form in the quest for speed – hunching the shoulders in
breaststroke reduces drag but is unacceptable as it has a detrimental
effect on body alignment. This is not to say that swimming in a more
mindful way reduces speed; on the contrary with the Shaw Method most
people are able to swim considerably faster and further than they ever
thought possible. This new approach limits the energy expended on non-
propulsive movements, gaining greater purchase on the water and so
realizing maximum benefit from precious time in the water.
If you are on the look out for a training manual that provides elaborate
tables telling you how far and fast to swim and how much rest to take
between each set, look elsewhere. There are countless ‘get fit’ swimming
books and websites that will give you this type of information. If you are
looking for something more reflective that encourages you to pause,
rethink your relationship with the water and explore each stroke in depth,
read on. Instead of mindlessly swimming lap after lap, you will learn to
pay attention to the process of swimming and develop the quality of the
experience. This learning goes far beyond the pool, providing you with a
powerful new model with which to approach any activity.
Taking the plunge into learning the art of swimming may seem somewhat
daunting, particularly for those with a more sedentary lifestyle. You may
feel self-conscious about your size and the prospect of being seen in
public in a swimming costume. However, having decided to embark on a
fitness programme it is far better to begin in the pool where the effects of
buoyancy significantly reduce the risks of injuring weight-bearing joints.
More regular swimmers may feel self conscious about practising new
strokes or performing unusual looking practices. Take comfort from the
fact only those swimmers straining their necks to keep their faces out of
the water will be watching. With any luck your progress will inspire them
to join in!

Steven’s Story
My earliest memories of swimming are of splashing around in the local
open-air lido where I spent much of my leisure time. The pool never
seemed to lose its magical appeal. During the summer months, the
anticipation was often overwhelming. I have vivid memories of one
scorching day, standing impatiently in what was surely the longest queue
ever. The interminable wait added to my sense of excitement and I can
remember my heart racing when my nose picked up the sweet scent of
chlorine. When we finally arrived at the turnstiles, I had to be restrained
from running ahead. I always wore my trunks under my trousers to avoid
wasting precious time.
Until the age of eight I spent my time at the children’s pool, a large
semi-circular construction where water streamed from the mouths of two
lion statues. The pool had a gradual, beach-style entrance with sloping
sides – great fun to run in and out of when the lifeguards weren’t
watching! We picnicked on the grassy banks surrounding the pool and
after the compulsory hour’s wait to ensure digestion we raced back to the
pool for more aquatic fun. The lido was much more than a pool: it was a
place to hang out with friends and family.
I was a clumsy child and the pool was one of the few places I felt safe
to explore movement without injuring myself. I spent hours inventing
pool games. My favourite was ‘The Torpedo’. The torpedo lay face down
in the water and the launcher got hold of his feet and pushed him
forward; whoever got the farthest was the winner. During my experience
as the torpedo I discovered that by tucking in my chin and breathing out
slowly I would travel further, that is as long as the launcher was any good.
Handstands and underwater cartwheels were also great fun.
In hindsight, these early experiences were invaluable for cultivating a
feeling of confidence and ease in the water. It was only when I started
teaching adults that I began to appreciate the value of simply exploring
the water.

--- Page 12 Text ---
Peer pressure and the lure of deeper water led me to the conclusion
that it was time to learn to swim ‘properly’, so I enrolled at a local
swimming class. The teacher was from the old school of teaching and if a
child held back he would be forced in. The experience of witnessing these
scenes made a strong impression on me. I can vividly remember the
atmosphere of fear at the school and can recall thinking that there must
be a better way to teach.
Time to get serious about swimming
I graduated from the local swimming school to the Mermaids and Marlins
swimming club, and started to train and compete. The club had some
international-level swimmers and it was inspirational to train alongside
them. It was not long before I was training for four hours a day, squeezed
in before and after school. Our coach drove us hard, an approach which
sometimes verged on bullying. One one occasion he caught me pulling a
lane rope along and punished me with a painful 1,500 metres of butterfly,
which put me off the stroke for years.
I pushed myself to the limit, naively believing his axiom that ‘Training
is suffering; after suffering comes results.’ Yet I never got beyond county
level. Despite being fit and strong, my technique let me down.
For the most part, my training consisted of swimming lap after lap,
and I would only occasionally get feedback from my coach. During these
rare sessions he analysed my stroke and this was always useful. I yearned
to swim with more finesse instead of thoughtlessly thrashing up and
down the pool. I read numerous technique manuals, but although these
were interesting they did not provide me with the tools to fundamentally
change my way of swimming.
I achieved my best times in the breaststroke and like most competitive
breaststrokers I cultivated a pattern of hunching my shoulders to achieve
maximum streamlining. Looking back at photographs of myself during
this period, it is clear that my habit of rounding my shoulders when on
dry land was shaped during this period. I was oblivious to the link
between the way I used my body in and out of the water.
By the age of seventeen, I was burnt out. Without success to spur me
on, I no longer enjoyed training and to cap it all my neck and upper back
felt sore. The feeling of freedom of movement that attracted me to
swimming in the first place had disappeared. I quit swimming and vowed

--- Page 13 Text ---
swimming in the first place had disappeared. I quit swimming and vowed
never to return. Giving up was a tremendous liberation: instead of
spending hours every week training and travelling to and from the pool, I
was able to develop a life beyond swimming.
The Alexander Technique
I became interested in political theory and went to study Philosophy and
Politics at Manchester University, in England. I was particularly
interested in exploring the connection between thought and action.
Like many students, I did very little physical activity, and my poor
posture combined with the pressure of exams caused my back and neck
to deteriorate. I tried massage, osteopathy and acupuncture, which
temporarily alleviated the discomfort but did not bring lasting relief. A
friend suggested that I try the Alexander Technique (AT), a system of
postural re-education. He explained that it addresses the root causes of
habitual patterns. I was sceptical but my friend was clearly benefiting
from it – he moved with a new sense of poise and appeared to be more at
ease with himself.
Eventually I signed up for a series of weekly private lessons. They
were no immediate panacea. The lessons were challenging and it was
several months before I noticed any changes. We explored simple
activities such as standing and walking. The teacher demonstrated
Primary Control – a dynamic relationship between the head, neck and
back, which is at the core of the Alexander approach. I came to the
daunting realization that most of the time I was completely oblivious to
the way I moved and functioned. However, what was liberating about
these early lessons (in contrast to my swimming training) was that I
never felt criticized or judged. My teacher simply encouraged me to direct
my attention away from trying to do the right thing and instead towards
working on eliminating bad habits. It was the cumulative effect of letting
my neck be free so that my back lengthened and widened, and the notion
of taking responsibility for my own condition, which inspired me to train
further in the Technique.
In 1987 I began a three-year Alexander Technique teacher-training
course in Tel Aviv. In Israel the AT is a widely accepted method for re-
educating the body, and is a part of basic training for military pilots. The
head of training at the school, Zeev Tadmore, came from a sporting and
martial arts background.

--- Page 14 Text ---
A central element of AT training is that before working with others
you are expected to employ the principles of the AT yourself. The
psychophysical state in which I arrived at the school was not a good one.
My posture was still poor, and my shoulders and upper back constantly
ached. My teacher was always positive and created a supportive and
nurturing environment. He encouraged me to investigate the sources of
my poor alignment, which included swimming.
During my time in Israel I worked as a lifeguard, which gave me the
opportunity to swim again. After an absence of five years it was good to
reconnect with the water; however, a familiar aching sensation in my
neck confirmed that my poor posture and what the AT describes as
‘misuse’ of the body were linked to my years of competitive training. The
focus in those years had been purely on speed with little regard for my
overall well-being.
My inability to notice the build-up of tension in my body when
swimming, despite being an AT student, was particularly distressing. This
lack of awareness was hard to comprehend, but my teacher explained
that habitual patterns of behaviour normally feel right and to change
them frequently feels wrong. For me, the tension was so familiar that it
felt natural, whereas swimming without strain felt odd and even
incorrect. As soon as I got into the water my old, habitual ways of
swimming returned: in breaststroke my shoulders ended up by my ears
and despite attempting to swim slowly and mindfully, I couldn’t stop
myself from racing whenever a fast swimmer came near me. I began to
realize that the postural patterns I had developed in the water were
merely symptoms of a much more complex problem which concerned my
whole approach to swimming.
Gradually, as my body awareness developed, I began to move more
easily through the water. It was still difficult to get into the pool without a
fixed goal, however, such as completing a certain number of lengths in a
given time. But by controlling my tendency to rush, in all aspects of my
life as well as in the water, I was able to alter the way I swam. I began to
appreciate that water offered both a sense of stillness and a unique
opportunity to explore freedom of movement.
When I began exploring my relationship with water, I was surprised
by the variety and intensity of surfacing memories. Keeping a journal
covering the content of my practice sessions and related thoughts and

--- Page 15 Text ---
covering the content of my practice sessions and related thoughts and
feelings helped me absorb the significance of this process and provided a
useful record of my journey. I now encourage my pupils to keep a similar
record whilst the experiences are still fresh in their mind, which many
find similarly helpful.
Working with others
Apart from improving my own relationship with the water during this
time, my job as a lifeguard gave me ample opportunity to observe others
swimming. I was shocked by the number of people who swam with their
heads held up out of the water, and from my new Alexander perspective
could now see how much neck strain this was causing. I began to notice
those who swam in a graceful, almost effortless way, allowing the head
and neck to move freely in and out of the water. I became increasingly
aware that the principal elements that set a good swimmer apart lay in
the relationship between the head, neck and back. Poorer swimmers
pulled their heads back and fixed their neck muscles.
A job at a holiday resort gave me a chance to discover more about
people’s early experiences of swimming. I was struck by the number of
adults who recalled negative incidents. They almost always reported that
their teachers, like mine, had encouraged them to apply more effort in
order to swim better. Together with my then wife Limor, also an AT
trainee, I began to explore ways of using hands-on guidance to help them
feel more comfortable in the water. Initially I worked mainly with fearful
swimmers, but found that competent swimmers also benefited from this
approach.
In 1992, a year after completing the AT teacher training, I returned to
the UK and began teaching the Technique in London. I also completed a
couple of swimming teacher courses at the local pool. I enjoyed the
courses greatly, but was very surprised that you were not required to
swim and were not allowed to teach from within the water.
Through conversations with my AT pupils I found that many of them
swam with their faces out of the water so I decided to offer ‘water
confidence’ lessons and within a relatively short time I was teaching a
range of abilities. I learned a great deal through my interaction with these
pupils. I could see that the combination of my competitive swimming
experience and the Alexander training was of enormous value.

--- Page 16 Text ---
In 1994, a pupil who was to have a major impact on my work booked a
series of swimming lessons. Armand D’Angour was in his mid-30s and
wanted to overcome a fear of water. He had tried to learn to swim several
times, but with little success. He had taken lessons in the Alexander
Technique and was intrigued by the prospect of applying AT principles to
swimming. The difference between his lessons with me and all his
previous instruction was the fact that I was successfully able to redirect
his attention and instead of fighting the water he learned to enjoy it.
Armand quickly learnt to swim with confidence and ease. He was
delighted with his progress and we decided to write a book together to
inspire others to learn to swim.
In 1996, The Art of Swimming: a New Direction with the Alexander
Technique was published by Ashgrove Press, offering a clear alternative
to the traditional model of swimming. It was the first book written from
an Alexander Technique standpoint to make an in-depth philosophical
investigation into a sporting activity. It challenged the popular belief that
swimming is always beneficial, illustrating how a defective style can do
more harm than good. It urged people to stop striving to swim faster and
further and start swimming in a more mindful way. The book received an
unexpected level of media attention and became a bestseller in its field.
The Shaw Method
The Art of Swimming not only had an impact on swimmers far and wide,
it also dramatically affected my life. Overnight, the demand for lessons
became overwhelming. I wanted to establish a teacher-training
programme, but was hesitant to define my way of teaching as a method
because I feared this would hinder the flexibility and intuitive nature of
the teaching process. However, without a clearly defined and structured
teaching model the approach could not be passed on to other teachers,
severely limiting its potential growth. So, after much deliberation, I began
to formalize the teaching as the Shaw Method of Swimming. Looking
back, this was a seminal moment in the development of the work and had
a very positive impact on both my teaching and swimming.
Although I had been endeavouring to apply Alexander Technique
principles to swimming, and had discovered new ways of guiding and
supporting people in the water, the work was still in its infancy. It had not
yet been formulated as a comprehensive teaching method.
Using a camcorder, I investigated my own swimming style to find out

--- Page 17 Text ---
Using a camcorder, I investigated my own swimming style to find out
whether I was moving in a way that promoted the best possible use of
myself. I remembered that Alexander had gone through a similar process
himself with the use of mirrors. Seeing myself swim for the first time was
quite an alarming and humbling experience. My head was much higher
than I thought it ought to be and although my movement looked fluent,
my arm and leg actions were not symmetrical. I concluded that my
swimming style required a complete overhaul.
From my AT experience I knew that to try and eliminate faults whilst
performing the full stroke was unlikely to be successful, as the stimulus to
move in habitual ways would just be too strong. I reasoned that the best
course of action was to separate out the core elements of each stroke and
work on them in isolation – both in the water and on dry land. Hopefully
this would override strongly ingrained patterns and offer a real possibility
of producing a new way of moving. The approach worked and proved to
be a powerful way of rebuilding my strokes; it also produced positive side
effects, altering the way I felt and moved both in and out of the pool.
Having found a way of fundamentally changing my swimming technique,
I now had the beginnings of a new model with which to teach others.

OS. that is, by the water itself.’ re
ne Plirdy, registered Shaw Method teacher — 4

--- Page 19 Text ---
Although swimming is one of the most popular forms of
exercise, most people do not swim well enough to really benefit
from the time they spend in the water, and many have
developed styles that strain their joints. The underlying goals of
speed and competition at the heart of conventional swimming
instruction often impede the acquisition of vital skills. Few are
able to swim continuously for 20 minutes – which is generally
considered the minimum time to gain cardiovascular benefit.
Learning the Shaw Method
If you have picked up this book you are probably fed up with
thrashing around in the pool or bored with counting laps. Let
the Shaw Method start a new era in your relationship with
water.
This chapter explains the key principles of the Shaw Method
of Swimming and dispels myths and fallacies. Chapter 2 guides
you though a series of practices that teach the core elements of
the Method. These preliminary practices may appear too
pedestrian for more accomplished swimmers. However, the
basics of awareness, direction and balance are at the heart of a
good stroke and must be mastered to develop the repertoire of
aquatic skills required for a healthier and more pleasurable style
of swimming.
Chapters 3–6 guide you though a series of easy-to-follow,
progressive practices on land and in the water, which teach my
unique formula for developing the four strokes: front crawl,
breaststroke, back crawl and butterfly. You will discover that a
non-propulsive movement precedes every propulsive
movement. These chapters also include accounts of each
stroke’s relative health benefits, outlining not only what to do
but, just as importantly, what to avoid. It is beneficial to work
through these with a partner as well as by yourself.
This book is not a ‘quick fix’ to your aquatic woes; rather it
points the way towards a more mindful and conscious
relationship with water. Goals such as improving cardiovascular
fitness must be temporarily set aside until you have established

--- Page 20 Text ---
relationship with water. Goals such as improving cardiovascular
fitness must be temporarily set aside until you have established
a firm foundation for your swimming strokes. Thereafter you
will be in a position to obtain greater health and fitness benefits
from your time in the water.
The key to success is cultivating a positive, open approach to
learning. Your level of skill or expertise in the water when you
begin this journey is immaterial. Free yourself from the
pressure of trying to perform the practices ‘correctly’ and use
them to start exploring the unknown. I have found that those
most successful at mastering the art of swimming posses the
ability to stop, listen and be patient.
When you flick through this book, the sheer number of
practices may overwhelm you. Don’t follow them mechanically –
they are there to encourage you to experiment with the way
you think and move, heighten your awareness and inspire
creativity. It is unnecessary to memorize exact sequences or
the finer points of a particular practice; a deeper understanding
will come with time. Initially, it is important to grasp the main
purpose of a practice and how it may apply to you.
It is futile to be overly concerned with stroke mechanics
before you feel at home in the water. Learn to trust the water
and allow it to support you instead of struggling against it. This
will completely transform the experience of swimming. This
may sound obvious, yet most swimmers find it hard to truly
relax in the water.
Swimming with the Alexander Technique
The Shaw Method is a creative step-by-step approach that has
helped thousands of people of all ages and abilities transform
their experience of swimming. In contrast with the majority of
teachers who adopt a competitive perspective, the Shaw
Method draws its inspiration from F.M Alexander’s powerful
technique for rediscovering natural balance and poise. Brief
descriptions of Alexander’s principles follow. Please thoroughly
acquaint yourself with them as they are used throughout this
book.

book.
Use – A term to describe a person’s psychophysical interaction
with their environment. Swimming with good use involves
moving through the water in a way that promotes good
alignment with minimal physical or mental strain.
Primary Control – For Alexander the quality of the head-neck-
back relationship was the single most important factor affecting
overall use. Paying attention to form and allowing the head to
lead the rest of the body is the best way to resolve specific
stroke faults.
Giving directions – The ability to project a series of
constructive thoughts that promote lengthening and widening.
In swimming to counter the tendency of pulling the arms
backwards it is useful to direct your attention to holding the
water and moving the torso forward.
Kinaesthetic awareness – The ability to sense the position,
orientation and movement of the body. Feedback from the
water enhances the development of body awareness.
End Gaining – Striving for results without attending to
process. Swimming for fitness without considering technique
often leads to strain and injury.
Inhibition – Creating the space for choice between stimulus
and reaction. To counter the undesirable habit of taking a big
breath before putting the face in the water it is necessary to
inhibit this automatic response before consciously inhaling.
Faulty sensory appreciation – Good use requires accurate
kinaesthetic awareness. Force of habit and a lack of conscious
control undermine this ability leading to faulty sensory
appreciation. If you are accustomed to an uneven breaststroke
leg action a symmetrical leg action is likely to feel wrong.
Thinking in Activity – Swimming in an unthinking way
reduces the ability to feel and respond to water, a mindful
approach enables you to become more responsive to the effects
of buoyancy and resistance and thereby more in tune with the
water.
Non-doing – The conscious ability to leave oneself alone and
avoid automatic responses. It is preferable to consciously let go

--- Page 22 Text ---
and allow the water to support you as opposed to trying to hold
yourself up.
Startle response – An automatic response to an unexpected,
sudden stimulus, our head reflexively moves back and down,
compressing the neck and stressing the rest of the body. While
the startle response is a natural reaction to fear, it is
inappropriate in the water and has a detrimental affect on the
ability to swim comfortably. Learning to free the neck and
allowing our back its full length and width promotes calmness
and ease in the water.
The power of habit
I am often taken aback by some people’s unrealistic
expectations of the learning process. Swimming habits develop
over many years and it is naive to expect an instant
transformation. Tai chi masters consider that it takes around
500 repetitions to learn a new movement and 5,000 to re-
pattern an old one.
Everyone has a tendency to return to habitual patterns in the
water. The sooner you learn to recognize these patterns, the
quicker you can start the process of changing them. Don’t give
yourself a hard time when you revert to your old ways and
don’t expect instant results; you will make progress.
Because our neuromuscular system is designed to work in
concert with gravity you may find some of the instructions
counterintuitive. To swim effectively you really have to use your
brain; following your instincts and doing what comes naturally
is unlikely to produce good results.
Over-breathing is one of the most common and unhelpful
aquatic habits. Most people unnecessarily and automatically
swallow excessive quantities of air just before submerging their
faces. They are oblivious to this pattern. Do you do this? Can
you choose a more appropriate course of action and inhale
passively? Unless you concentrate, you are likely to slip back
into the unconscious pattern.
The power of an ingrained habit also makes it more difficult

--- Page 23 Text ---
The power of an ingrained habit also makes it more difficult
to correct stroke faults than you might envisage. Because the
pattern has been repeated so many times, it feels normal and
comfortable. Also, the root cause of a particular pattern may be
far from obvious, as the following example from my own
experience indicates.
On seeing footage of my front crawl, I was concerned to note
that my left and right above-water arm actions were different. I
could see that my left hand twisted as it entered the water,
which surprised me as I am left-handed and expected to have
more control with the left hand than the right. For several
months, I focused attention on my left arm to rectify this, but
disappointingly the action remained virtually unchanged. It was
only when someone pointed out that my left arm looked more
effective underwater that I began to unravel this puzzle. I
finally grasped the fact that the over-rotation of my left arm
resulted from a less than effective underwater action of the
right arm. This experience taught me that the process of
remedying a particular stroke fault involves three essential
stages: an awareness of what is actually happening, an
accurate appreciation of the root cause of the difficulty, and a
clear psychophysical strategy for change.
Stillness and movement
Learning the art of swimming requires a major shift in your
approach to movement in water and on land. Stillness, and
being in the moment, are the starting points for all conscious
movement. To perform a sequence of movements accurately, it
is necessary to have a clear idea of the desired objective. Pause
and think before launching into any of the practices: you are
more likely to achieve positive results with appropriate
preparation. Many people find it extremely useful to visualize a
sequence of movements, at the correct pace, before
proceeding.
When pupils perform a movement incorrectly, I ask them to
describe what they were attempting to do. This often reveals
that they were either performing the wrong action or were

--- Page 24 Text ---
that they were either performing the wrong action or were
simply not thinking at all. Allowing the mind to wander, as
Alexander pointed out, is a major impediment to developing
body awareness.
Where to swim
It is important to select a suitable environment in which to
practise. Ideally, this should be a warm pool with a large area
of shallow water. Try to avoid crowded, deep or cold pools. A
teaching pool at the local leisure centre may be a good option.
If you cannot get regular access to an ideal environment, make
the best of what is available. The great thing about the
practices in this book is that they do not require a large area of
water. Working within a smaller area can be an advantage; you
are required to stop more often, helping you to pay attention
moment to moment.
Pool temperature is potentially one of the most challenging
issues for anyone learning the Shaw Method. An average pool is
27–29°C (80–84°F), which feels comfortable if you are
swimming laps, but if you are less confident or working through
some of the less energetic sequences in this book, it can feel
very chilly. If you start to feel too cold, include some more
vigorous movements or shorten the session. Alternatively, you
could wear a swimming cap as you lose around 30 per cent of
your body heat from the top of your head; if you are
particularly susceptible to the cold, why not try a lightweight
thermal swimming top.
The Art of Swimming on dry land
For many of the water-based practices, there are equivalent
ones to do on dry land. These are an integral part of the Shaw
Method and should not be viewed as unnecessary or
superfluous to the process of swimming. They help establish
and reinforce new patterns of movement in preparation for
swimming, developing your kinaesthetic awareness and sense
of balance and control. You may initially find it hard to relate
the land practices (which for the most part are performed

--- Page 25 Text ---
the land practices (which for the most part are performed
upright) to swimming movements, but with regular repetition
the link will become clearer.
Many pupils are surprised to find that seemingly complex
movements are more easily absorbed and integrated into their
swimming through regular land work. Some people feel self-
conscious about performing swimming movements out of the
water. If your friends or family think you have a screw loose,
tell them it is a new martial art! Spend just a few minutes a day
and it will not be long before you start reaping the benefits.
Our swimming habits can be so strong that it is often easier
to change the tone and quality of the movements simply by
stepping out of the water. The effects of buoyancy and
resistance obviously make working on land a very different
experience to working in water. However, on land you can
develop the desired sequences of movements and repeat them
often enough for them to feel familiar.
Practice sessions
Initially, try to spend 20–30 minutes on each session. When
you are more experienced, you will be able to centre your
attention for longer periods. Work on no more than four new
practices in any one session. As discussed earlier, even the
most elementary practices take a while to master, and until the
new pattern of movement is firmly established the old, habitual
one is likely to creep back. Avoid the temptation to swim the
full stroke during the early stages, as this is likely to reinforce
old patterns and leave you confused.
Working with a partner
Compared to other health and fitness pursuits, swimming can
feel quite solitary. For some this provides the privacy that they
lack in other parts of their lives; others may welcome the
opportunity to share the experience.
In the absence of a Shaw Method teacher, partner work is

In the absence of a Shaw Method teacher, partner work is
excellent for developing awareness, with a great deal to be
learned through mutual observation and feedback. You may be
surprised by how quickly your observation skills grow. Be
sensitive towards your partner and always give constructive
feedback without overly focusing on what you think he or she is
doing wrong.
Myths about swimming and fitness
It is not necessarily the case that practice makes perfect – it
can make things worse. Many regular swimmers rehearse the
same mistakes; bad habits become more ingrained and harder
to unlearn. It is imperative to practise in a constructive way and
think about the quality of movement.
Believing that if something does not work at first you should
try harder is often a formula for failure rather than success. It is
more productive to approach swimming with a spirit of
exploration.
You do not need to wear yourself out in order to have a
worthwhile workout. A healthy approach to fitness requires
good body alignment and a good technique. Many people
underestimate the importance of this and think they can
improve their swimming by just getting fitter. What usually
happens is that they get more efficient at injuring themselves!
Put aerobic fitness objectives to one side until you have
established a healthy way of swimming.
Some people are under the impression that they do not need
to think about the way they swim. They use swimming as a way
of switching off and let their minds wander. However, if you do
not pay attention to the way you are swimming you are not
only more likely to injure yourself, but your mind is more likely
to drift to things that bother you. Paying attention to what you
are doing is a better way of switching off, as it clears the mind
of its usual chatter.

Back to basics
The title of this chapter, ‘Fun-da-mentals’, emphasizes the fact
that it is more fun to be imaginative and mindful in the water
than to switch off and swim on automatic pilot. This section
guides you through a series of foundation practices that will
help you to explore and understand the physics of swimming,
particularly the effects of buoyancy and resistance. If you are
an accomplished swimmer, do not think that you can skip this
section. Whatever your ability, you have to go ‘back to basics’.
In order to develop a way of swimming that promotes the best
possible ‘use’ of the body, as the Alexander Technique describes
it, you must have a wide repertoire of skills. Although many of
these skills can be cultivated during the process of re-learning
the four strokes, they are more effectively assimilated without
the distraction of trying to get from one end of the pool to the
other.
Here is an opportunity to develop a new relationship with the
water. The practices in this chapter enhance awareness of the
body, poise and balance, enabling you to stop struggling
against the water and start working with it. They not only offer
a solid base for swimming more effectively but are also
beneficial in themselves, improving overall poise and balance on
dry land.
Buoyancy
On land, gravitational force exerts a downward pressure on our
bodies, which causes compression of weight-bearing joints
including the spine, ankles, knees and hips. On entering the
water, we are instantly liberated from these downward
pressures because water counteracts the effect of gravity.
When the body is submerged, the effects of buoyancy create
more space for the joints to move, so instead of joints being
wedged together they gently float apart. When submerged to
chest level, the upward pressure of the water effectively
reduces body weight by 90 per cent, allowing movement with

--- Page 29 Text ---
reduces body weight by 90 per cent, allowing movement with
minimal strain on the joints and ligaments. Leonardo Da Vinci
wrote that swimming is the closest Man will ever get to the
sensation of flying.
The capacity of an object to float is determined by its
relative density or its weight and the amount of water it
displaces. If the amount of water displaced weighs more than
the object, the object will float; if the water weighs less than it,
the object will sink. In other words, for an object to sink, the
force of gravity must be greater than that of the upthrust
produced by the water.
The average density of the human body is a little less than
that of fresh water, which means that in a typical swimming
pool most people float naturally.
In the sea or in a floatation tank, where the water has a
much greater density, the body floats higher in the water.
Our ability to float is also influenced by body type: a lean,
muscular person will usually find it more difficult to float than
someone who is more rounded. The muscle mass to body fat
ratio is the main reason why older people find it easier to float.
Over the age of forty, most people tend to lose muscle tone and
gain body fat, which is why people who tended to sink in their
youth often discover that it is much easier to float when they
reach middle age. Another factor that significantly affects
buoyancy is muscular tension. This is particularly apparent in
apprehensive swimmers, who tend to swim with contracted
muscles. By developing the ability to release and lengthen,
even those with a higher propensity to sink can discover how to
optimize the effects of buoyancy and become accomplished
swimmers.
Balance and stability
One of the hallmarks of an efficient swimmer is the ability to
achieve a horizontal body position. Although most people can
float, few can do so horizontally. The centre of buoyancy is
located in the upper torso, due to the concentration of air in the

--- Page 30 Text ---
located in the upper torso, due to the concentration of air in the
lungs, whereas the centre of mass is in the relatively heavy hip
area. The natural tendency of the upper body to float and the
lower body to sink makes the finding of a relatively flat position
in the water far from straightforward. It helps to ‘let go’ and
allow the water to support you; however, unless you are
extremely buoyant, your legs will still tend to drag you down.
The gliding practices in this chapter will teach you how to
achieve a horizontal position by fine-tuning the alignment of the
head and the direction of the limbs.
Although the ability to float in a relatively static situation is
an important skill, maintaining balance in a more dynamic
situation, when arms and legs are producing propulsion, is even
more critical. Efficient swimmers constantly adjust their balance
to maintain stability. In the crawl, for example, the left arm
counterbalances the action of the right leg.
The relative weight of the head in relation to the rest of the
body means that its position is vital. If you lie horizontally in
the water with your face submerged, you can immediately
detect how ostensibly minute sideways movements of the head
influence the rest of the body. In water, where the head acts as
a rudder leading the way, the significance of a good head-neck-
back relationship is amplified. An awareness of this not only
improves poise when swimming, but can also promote a greater
understanding of the profound effect that the carriage of the
head has on everyday life. It is useful to explore this
phenomenon, as by raising awareness of your head-neck-back
relationship on dry land, you will find it easier to maintain
primary control in the water.
Resistance
Another factor that differentiates movement in water and on
land relates to the effects of resistance or, more accurately,
hydrostatic pressure, which is around a thousand times greater
in water than in air. This pressure, apart from slowing us down,
gives the nervous system useful feedback and is one of the
reasons why hydrotherapy is so effective in the treatment of
neurological conditions. The late Christopher Reeve, who

--- Page 31 Text ---
neurological conditions. The late Christopher Reeve, who
became quadriplegic following a serious riding accident,
countered commonly held beliefs about his condition when he
discovered that he could partially move his legs in water.
Hydrostatic pressure increases with the depth of the water.
Gently exhale and allow your body to sink, and you will notice
an increase in the pressure on your ears. Place your hand just
beneath the surface of the water and swish it back and forth:
see how easy it is to move your hand. Now reach deeper and
perform the same action: you will observe that it takes
significantly more effort to produce the same movement.
Hydrostatic pressure not only affects the functioning of our
nervous system and limbs, but also the functioning of our
internal organs, in particular the kidneys. Breathing while
submersed in shoulder-deep water requires more effort than
breathing on land, because the pressure of the water resists
expansion of the chest.
Efficient swimming
The challenges faced by anyone wishing to master the art of
swimming are to utilize the resistance of water in order to
achieve maximum power without undue strain, and to become
streamlined without compromising ‘use’. This section points the
way to meeting these challenges effectively by applying some
general principles; stroke-specific guidance will be explored
later.
Most people’s approach to swimming is automatic; they have
little appreciation of how to maximize benefit from energy
expended. When they feel like going faster, they simply move
their arms and legs faster and apply more effort to the whole
stroke. This is counterproductive, as it not only produces strain
and fatigue but also creates turbulence and increases
resistance. Instead of conserving their energy on the non-
propulsive parts of the stroke, they apply maximum force
throughout.
The realization that a non-propulsive movement precedes
each propulsive movement can completely transform their

--- Page 32 Text ---
each propulsive movement can completely transform their
experience. Increased sensitivity and control in the non-
propulsive phases enable a swimmer to find the optimum limb
position before applying force, resulting in improved purchase,
economy of energy and increased flow.
Alexander’s notion of ‘good use’ provides us with a very
effective barometer for assessing stroke mechanics. Ask
yourself whether you are lengthening and widening your back
or narrowing and shortening it. If the former is the case, this is
worth cultivating; if the opposite is true, it is time to change.
This contrasts greatly with a competitive approach, where
speed is the goal and swimmers are encouraged to be as
streamlined as possible with little regard for what constitutes
good overall use. In the Shaw Method, the mark of a truly
efficient swimmer is characterized by the ability to maximize
distance per stroke in a way that promotes the best possible
use.
Breathing with ease
The ability to breathe with ease is another major challenge for
anyone wishing to master the art of swimming. An
understanding of the principles of aquatic breathing will help
swimmers of all abilities: confident swimmers learn to negotiate
the transition between water and air without straining their
necks, and less accomplished swimmers learn to approach the
breathing process with less anxiety.
You will not progress with the Shaw Method unless you are
able to immerse your face and breathe out calmly; the quality
of the out-breath significantly affects the ability to breathe in
and vice versa. Anxiety about taking in water makes many
people delay inhalation for as long as possible, which only
exacerbates the problem. Starved of oxygen, they feel
compelled to inhale forcefully, which leads to the unpleasant
sensations of either swallowing or sniffing water along with air.
Avoid getting to the point of having to take a breath: it is
better to breathe out gently or inhale more frequently. Efficient
swimmers time their inhalations through choice rather than

--- Page 33 Text ---
swimmers time their inhalations through choice rather than
necessity. Some good advice, which is drawn directly from the
Alexander Technique, is to pay attention to the out-breath and
allow the in-breath to happen by itself. The following points 1–
7, supported by land-based practices and observation, will
prepare you for a more comfortable and controlled experience
of breathing in the water.
1. Breathing and primary control
More than a century ago Alexander observed that the
relationship between the head, neck and back profoundly
affects the respiratory system, and that whenever this
relationship is out of balance, breathing is disturbed. He
concluded that working on one’s poise is more likely to have a
positive effect than doing breathing exercises. This principle
applies equally to swimming. The following practice illustrates
how poor alignment has a detrimental effect on the quality of
exhalation, underlining why swimming with the head pulled
back reduces one’s ability to breathe with ease.
• Sit forward on a stable chair with both feet firmly on the floor.
Rock forward from the hips, maintaining the length of the
neck and back, until your upper body is at 45° with the eyes
looking forward and down (1a).
• Gently say ‘Aah’ and see how long you can comfortably
sustain this sound.
• Now, without altering your position, take a breath in and pull
the head back so your eyes look ahead. Say ‘Aah’ again, and
note any changes in the duration or quality of the sound (1b,
see overleaf). Most people experience a deterioration in tone,
because their breathing apparatus is strained.

--- Page 34 Text ---
2. Oral inhalation
Inhalation through the nose is all right when breathing on land,
but inappropriate when swimming. When you raise your face
after being submerged, the nostrils remain moist and so if you
breathe in through your nose, water is likely to get drawn up
the nasal passage. This unpleasant experience often leads to
apprehension about submerging the face.
• Before you practise breathing when in the pool, familiarize
yourself with oral inhalation out of the water.
• While breathing through the mouth, explore activities such as
sitting and standing, or walking.
3. Passive inhalation
The first and most important rule of breathing with ease is to
never take a breath! Be careful not to misinterpret this
statement. I do not advocate breath-holding, but propose that
passive inhalation is all that is required to swim efficiently.
Excessive inhalation is unnecessary and can be harmful, leading
to hyperventilation and even panic. This deeply ingrained
tendency is widespread. Observe swimmers of all levels and you

--- Page 35 Text ---
will see the vast majority gulping in large quantities of air in
preparation for launching off. They behave as if they were
about to travel a vast distance under the water or take their
last breath.
4. Perils of excessive exhalation
Just as holding the breath is inadvisable, so too is the opposite
pattern of explosively breathing out. Emptying your lungs
completely before breathing in is not only a recipe for anxiety
but also reduces buoyancy. Trickle breathing – exhaling
gradually in the water – is a more positive alternative. Initially
you may find it helpful to vocalize while breathing out.
• Explore emptying your lungs forcefully and notice how this
leads to gasping.
• Now breathe out in a gentler manner and note how the
resulting inhalation is calmer.
• Remember to avoid excessive or premature exhalations!
5. The oral and nasal seal
The sight of people holding their nose and breath as they
prepare to put their face in the water is all too familiar. Many
falsely believe that an open nose and mouth will inevitably lead
to water entering the lungs. In fact, when the face is immersed,
the pressure inside the lungs automatically equalizes with that
of the water, producing a seal that prevents water passing the
larynx. As long as you do not inhale, you can relax the nose and
leave the mouth open without drawing in water. Knowledge of
these oral and nasal seals can be extremely liberating for those
keen to relax their breathing. The following practice, using a
basin or bowl of tepid water, demonstrates this phenomenon.
• Open your mouth and gently breathe in through it.
• Maintaining an open mouth, relax the jaw and tongue, and
immerse the face.
• Remain in this position for around ten seconds, without

--- Page 36 Text ---
• Remain in this position for around ten seconds, without
breathing.
• Enjoy the sensation of water being inside the mouth and
nostrils without flooding the lungs.
6. Breathing against resistance
Many vastly underestimate the length of time they can
comfortably exhale into the water. Almost as soon as they start
breathing out, they feel the air in their lungs has been
expended. In reality, water is much denser than air and a
breath actually lasts significantly longer. Even if you play a wind
instrument, you would struggle to empty your lungs in a few
seconds under water.
• To simulate the effects of water pressure on breathing, place
your palm over your mouth and breathe out into it. Notice
how long you are able to maintain the out-breath.
• Now repeat the same action with the face unobstructed, and
notice how much more quickly the breath is expelled.
7. Facial tension and breath control
On one of your field trips to the local pool, observe people’s
facial expressions. You may be surprised to see many people
grimace just before putting their faces in the water. If you were
to watch them beneath the surface, you would see that many
maintain this facial tension whilst submerged. Apart from not
being very flattering, this significantly impedes effective breath
control. The link between respiration and facial expression is
highlighted in the following practice.
• Screw up your face and attempt to say ‘Aah’ for a few
seconds. Notice the tone and the quality of the out-breath.
• Now contrast this with a relaxed facial expression.
• Obviously, almost everyone finds it easier to exhale when the
face is relaxed.

Steps in the water
You are now ready to explore the aquatic environment and start
applying control to your movements. The following practices will
help you to release tight muscles, achieve balance and stability,
breathe with ease, generally feel more at home in the water
and, most importantly, to have fun using your brain!
The opening stance for all pool-based practices, unless
otherwise stated, is as follows. Stand in chest-deep water with
your feet hip-width apart and your weight evenly distributed.
Keep your shoulders relaxed, with your arms hanging by your
sides. Look straight ahead without fixing the gaze (pictured
right).
When doing the practices, soften your joints, allowing them
to be movable, and experiment with breathing through the
mouth. For any backward or sideways practices, look around to
ensure that there is a clear pathway.
1. Weightless walking
Because walking is such a familiar, everyday activity, most
people rarely pay much attention to it. It is only when injured,
or trying on a new pair of shoes, that they consider how they
walk. In regular walking, the arms naturally swing alternately to
the legs; this cross-pattern action provides balance and
stability. In water, the effects of resistance and buoyancy
change the walking experience. The arms do not swing
naturally; many hold them stiffly or move right leg and right
arm together. In water it is not necessary to actively lift the
foot: simply release the knee and allow it to float upwards, then
actively put the foot down. Walking in water is an ideal way to
work on balance and to acclimatize to the water, and because
of the effects of resistance, it requires more energy expenditure
so you can use the practice to burn calories. It is also beneficial
for those with joint pain who may experience difficulty walking
on dry land, as a means of re-establishing a normal walking
pattern.

back to front, which also aids oral and

10 The wave Mobilizing the whole body. Leading down
with the head against the effects of
buoyancy and experiencing upthrust;
exploring different depths.
• Take up the opening stance. The water’s buoyancy will help
you to stand tall. Raise the right leg by shifting your weight
on to the left leg; ensure that the knee does not go too high
as this may cause a loss of balance.
• Maintaining the position of the head, make a small step
forward with the left leg, and simultaneously move the right
arm a few inches forward to counterbalance the leg.
• Actively press the left foot down so that both feet are flat on
the floor. The movement resembles a march, with the
emphasis on the downward action of the foot. Maintain an
upright stance as the foot presses down.
• Pause for 3–4 seconds, and become aware of your balance
and the relationship between your head, neck and back before
taking a second step.
• Alternate the arms and legs, ensuring that the left leg moves
forward and down as the right arm extends to counterbalance
it (1a).
• Once you are comfortable with the timing, eliminate the pause
and move continually (1b). You can also explore variations in
pace, and explore deeper water. Walking more slowly
encourages you to focus on balance and utilizes postural
muscles. Speed and depth increase resistance, requiring more
energy expenditure and resulting in more of a fitness workout.

--- Page 41 Text ---
Remember Lead with the legs and let the arms follow; take
small steps leading with the toe; place the heel down first. Keep
the heel of the back foot down (feel the hamstring and calf
muscles lengthen) until the other foot is fully in contact with the
floor. This is essential in maintaining your sense of balance and
forward direction. More effort is required to move in deeper
water.
Avoid Don’t walk too quickly, move the arm and leg on the
same side together, fix the arms by the sides, cross the mid-
line with arms or legs, look down or pull the head back, or
overextend the arms by pushing them too far forward.
2. Retro walking
Unless you work as a tour guide or a Shaw Method swimming
teacher, you are unlikely to spend much time walking
backwards, or retro walking. Research has shown that it is a
valuable form of exercise, which is becoming increasingly
popular with physiotherapists as a part of rehabilitation
programmes. Retro walking is not simply the mirror image of
forward walking; it calls for an increased range of motion in the
knee joint and a similar reduction of movement in the hip.
Walking backwards also requires more control of the trunk
muscles, stretches the hamstrings and releases the hip flexors.
• Apart from aiding muscle balance and strengthening opposing

--- Page 42 Text ---
• Apart from aiding muscle balance and strengthening opposing
muscles, retro walking in water has an additional benefit: it
helps cultivate a greater awareness of the connection between
the movement of the legs and the lower back. This skill is also
essential when guiding or directing a partner, for example in
the glide.
• From a standing position, lower the body by releasing the
knees until the shoulders are at water level. Allow the arms to
float in front of you with the palms upwards (2a).
• Gently press your lower back against the water and smoothly
slide your feet over the floor (2b).
Remember Connect with the floor, lead with the heels, release
the lower back and widen across the shoulders.
Avoid Do not overbalance by leaning back with the upper back;
do not lift the feet off the floor or move the head from side to
side.
3. The bellows
Moving sideways, unless you are trying to squeeze through a
narrow space, is quite unfamiliar. Because of the reduction in
frontal resistance, sideways movement through water is both
easier as you experience the benefits of streamlining and
harder as it is more difficult to balance. Sideways movement is
particularly important in front and back crawl, where the aim is
to minimize drag and maximize reach.
This practice familiarizes you with being on your side and
teaches you how to incorporate a regulated breathing pattern
as you widen with the effect of buoyancy, and lengthen in
response to the water’s resistance.

--- Page 43 Text ---
• Standing at full height, turn the body sideways with feet
together, hands resting by your sides, and head centred. If
the right side is leading, the eyes should look directly to the
left throughout (3a).
• Elevate the left leg and step sideways, opening the arms to
horizontal just above the surface of the water (3b). As the
arms open, allow air to enter through the mouth.
• Draw the right leg towards the left and actively press the
arms down until you are in the original opening stance. As you

--- Page 44 Text ---
arms down until you are in the original opening stance. As you
press down, breathe out and think about lengthening along
the spine (3a).
Remember Allow the effects of buoyancy to assist the
elevation of the arms and the process of breathing in. Pressing
against the water provides the stimulus to breathe out. Like a
pair of bellows, inflate as you open the arms and deflate as you
close them.
Avoid Do not actively lift the arms, lean forward as the arms
close, or twist the neck to look in the direction that you are
travelling in.
4. The lunge
This practice, which is performed by the wall of the pool,
cultivates good alignment, giving you the opportunity to free
the neck and feel how the arm extension originates from the
back. It allows you to work on balance and stability in water
whilst still being grounded through contact with the floor and
walls of the pool. It is also a useful practice for making a
smooth transition from standing upright to lying face down.
• Stand in the water, about a metre (3ft) away from the side of
the pool.
• Place your right foot forward and gently release the knee; if
possible keep the left heel on the floor – the effects of
buoyancy make it more difficult to keep the heel down, which
further encourages lengthening of the hamstrings.
• Maintain the head-neck-back relationship and extend both
arms to the wall as the body tilts forward (hands are angled
down with fingers below the wrists, wrists below elbows,
elbows below shoulders and the head is in continuation of the
spine).
• Generate an even pressure against the wall as you send the
back backwards. Remain in this position for the count of ten
(4a).
• Alternate the feet and notice if there are any differences

--- Page 45 Text ---
• Alternate the feet and notice if there are any differences
between the left and right sides.
Remember If possible, keep the heel flat on the floor to help
lengthen the hamstrings and improve the relationship between
the legs. The arms connect to the back; as they reach forward,
the lower back is directed backwards.
Avoid Do not pull the head back, bury the head, bend the
elbows or arch the back.
* For a more difficult version of the practice, do it without the
support of the wall, as it is harder to maintain balance and
more of a challenge for the postural muscles.
5. Facing the water
Most people find the water a little cold when they first enter a
pool, and it normally takes a minute or two to acclimatize.
Wetting the face is a gentle way to approach facial immersion,
teaching you to counteract the automatic tendency to tense up
when water makes contact with the face. This practice can be
very soothing, releasing tension in the jaw and neck.
• Without goggles (unless you are wearing contact lenses) cup

--- Page 46 Text ---
• Without goggles (unless you are wearing contact lenses) cup
both hands and collect water in your palms (5a).
• Softly close your eyes and slowly bring the water towards
your forehead (5b). Explore your automatic reaction – is it to
screw up your face, hold your breath or pull your head back
as the water approaches?
• Work on inhibiting these automatic reactions and consciously
soften your face as the water makes contact.
• Release tension in the jaw as you gently drag your hands
down the face and over the eyelids, while slowly breathing out
and saying ‘Aah’. This often produces a very soothing
sensation, which can be very helpful in releasing tension
headaches.
Remember Perform this action as slowly as possible; soften
your chest and stomach as well as the face.

--- Page 47 Text ---
Avoid Do not hold your breath, pull the head back, or tense the
facial muscles.
6. Lunging with the face submerged
The next stage is to combine placing the face in the water with
the lunge practice. To do this, it is preferable to wear goggles,
open the eyes and look down at the floor. This can be
performed with and without contact with the side of the pool, or
with a partner supporting your wrists. It familiarizes you with
the sensation of breathing out into water while having your feet
firmly on the floor. As was discussed earlier, it is important to
passively inhale prior to putting the face in the water, and to

--- Page 48 Text ---
passively inhale prior to putting the face in the water, and to
exhale gently into the water.
• Stand in water no deeper than chest-level, facing the side of
the pool and about a metre (3ft) away from it. Maintain this
position for a few seconds, breathing in a relaxed and
continuous manner, until you feel stable and balanced.
• With arms extended think about maintaining the length of
your neck and back. With your right foot forward lower
yourself down and place the face in the water. Gently start to
exhale, saying ‘Aah’.
• Continue to exhale as you lean into the water, with your
weight shifting to the hands and front leg, until the mouth and
nose are fully submerged. Gently exhale for around five
seconds (6a).
• Before running low on breath, step forward with the left leg as
you press down with the arms to raise the head and torso out
of the water. Maintain this upright stance for the count of five
and then step back and repeat the practice, leading with the
left leg. Wait until the water dribbles out of your mouth and
nose before allowing the in-breath.
Remember Lengthen along the spine as you move between
the vertical and horizontal plane. Those less familiar with

--- Page 49 Text ---
putting their faces in the water may find it easier to do this
practice with both feet parallel, bending at the knees, and only
moving on to the one-foot-forward version when they feel
confident and stable.
Avoid Don’t take a large step, shorten the neck, or gasp or
swallow air just before the face enters the water. Don’t pull the
head back, lift the arms up or arch the back.
7(i). The glide
A lack of poise and symmetry when swimming is often the
result of not having spent sufficient time learning to be still in
the water. Learning to glide and regain the feet in a balanced
manner can have a very positive effect on one’s overall sense of
control in the water.
The glide is the ultimate opportunity to experience the
tangible benefits of ‘non-doing’. It calls for the capacity to trust
the water as well as to lengthen and widen. When this is
achieved, the glide brings a powerful sense of ease and
liberation. Novices and competent swimmers alike often
attempt to hold themselves up, instead of allowing the whole
body to be supported by the water. This is often due to the
misconception that if they do nothing they will sink. However,
for most of us, when the water supports the head it actually
takes more effort to sink than it does to float.
The glide is also an excellent way to really grasp the core
Alexander Technique principle of leading with the head. When
the whole body rests quietly just below the surface, the water
gives us direct and accurate feedback on the quality of the
relationship of the head, neck and back. If, for example, the
head is orientated slightly off-centre, it will be very difficult to
maintain a straight course.
• Face the length or width of the pool and start as in the
previous practice. This time, when you feel your weight
transferring to the front foot, lean forward and start to exhale.
Lean into the water as the head leads the movement into the
horizontal plane (7[i]a).

--- Page 50 Text ---
horizontal plane (7[i]a).
• Gently drift forward. Keep the arms relaxed, extended forward
and angled slightly downward in order to maintain stability
and prevent arching.
• Lengthen and widen the back while continuing to exhale
gently.
• Keep the legs straight and together without locking the knees
or lifting the hips (7[i]b).
• Maintain the glide for 5–6 seconds before starting to regain
the feet (see 7ii).

--- Page 51 Text ---
Remember Think of your head as a rudder, with the crown
leading while the arms act as stabilizers. Trust the water to
support you, and move at a slow steady pace, freeing the neck
and releasing tension. Consciously relax the hands, which will
promote a sense of letting go throughout the rest of the body.
Avoid Do not push off from the floor, snatch a breath just
before the face enters the water, pull the head back at any
point, hold the breath or exhale forcefully.
7(ii). Finding the feet
The way in which most people automatically try to regain their
feet from the glide is to pull the head back. (This is very similar
to the way in which many stand from sitting.) The Shaw Method
for finding the feet is a combination of tucking up the body as if
to prepare to somersault, followed by a skipping action.
• Bow the head forward and down, flex the ankles and make
your toes point to the floor by bending the knees and bringing
the feet forward, curling up into a foetal position whilst
maintaining the length and direction of the arms (7[ii]a).
• Gradually swing the arms towards the hips, tuck the pelvis
under using the abdominals and muscles of the lower back.
Begin to uncurl your spine and roll the head up so that the
eyes look straight ahead.

--- Page 52 Text ---
eyes look straight ahead.
• Land in a balanced manner with the feet parallel and firmly
planted on the floor (7[ii]b). Extend to full height with the
head centred.
Remember Finding the feet from the glide is about getting
down, not getting up – as long as you intend to get up it is very
hard to inhibit the tendency to pull the head back. Enjoy the
sense of curling and uncurling, and continue to breathe out as
your face leaves the water.
Avoid Do not pull the head back or keep it pressed down as the
arms sweep back. Do not pull the arms back before the tuck, as
this will force the legs back up. Do not land on one foot.
* For a more difficult version of the practice, do it with your
arms by your sides, as it is harder to maintain balance and
provides more of a challenge for the abdominal muscles.
8. Floating on the back
The ability to float on your back varies greatly from person to
person. By learning to relax and extend the arms, many
confirmed sinkers are surprised to find they can actually float.
Attitudes to floating on the back also vary greatly: some people
feel out of control while others feel more comfortable on their
back than on their front. This practice will help less buoyant
people float, and help ‘extreme floaters’ to regain their feet with
ease.
• Prepare to float on your back.
• Without turning the head, release the knees and gradually
lower the body into a crouch.
• Turn the palms upwards and gradually extend the arms to the
side as you lean backwards (8a). Once both arms are
extended, take one foot and then the other off the floor and
float on to your back. Continue to sweep the arms until they
are fully extended behind the head, resembling the glide

--- Page 53 Text ---
described previously (8b).
• To regain your feet, first tuck in the chin, then bend the
ankles and knees (8c), and then finally sweep the arms round
until they reach the surface with palms facing up (8d).
Remember Free the neck to allow the weight of the head to be
supported by the water. Release the shoulders as the arms
move backwards and attempt to keep the arms submerged,
with palms upward, throughout. When standing, tuck before
using the arms – the face may get a little wet at first, but with
practice you will be able to avoid this.
Avoid Do not throw the head backwards or lift it as you take
off. Do not arch the back, lift the head or tilt it back in the glide.
Do not stiffen the neck when regaining the feet.
9. Rotation
The ability to rotate provides a solid foundation for developing
both the front and back crawl. This practice connects floating on
the back with gliding on the front, utilizing a hip rotation to
achieve the transition. It teaches breath control as you move
from air to water, and reinforces the principle of leading with

--- Page 54 Text ---
from air to water, and reinforces the principle of leading with
the head.
• Float on your back with your arms by your sides. If you tend
to sink, perform a gentle, leg action to keep the feet up, but
do not use them for propulsion.
• Allow the water to support the weight of the head and breathe
gently. Aim to maintain this position for ten seconds (9a).
• Without moving the rest of the body, start looking towards
your left shoulder.
• Allow the shoulder and then the hip to follow the movement of
the head (9b) until you are face down and flat in the water,
with your arms still by your sides.
• Breathe out in the transition between air and water. Remain
floating, with your arms by your sides, for five seconds. Then
tuck to regain your feet.
• Perform this movement again, looking towards the right
shoulder. Most people have a preferred side.
Remember This movement feels like rolling a log: ensure that
shoulders and hips remain loose to facilitate the movement. If
you are uncomfortable regaining your feet with your arms by
your sides, feel free to extend them.

--- Page 55 Text ---
Avoid Do not lead the rotation with any body part other than
the head. Do not close the eyes and/or hold your breath as your
face becomes immersed. Do not pull the head back when
regaining the feet.
10. The wave
All the previous practices are performed on either a vertical or
horizontal plane; this practice allows you to explore movement
between these planes. It also gives you the opportunity to
experiment with different depths and the upthrust of the water,
which is important in both the breaststroke and butterfly
strokes.

--- Page 56 Text ---
The wave is a great confidence-building practice, which also
mobilizes the spine. Many people initially find it challenging, but
then it becomes fun and exhilarating. The key is to focus on
directing the body forward and not simply up and down.
• Step forward into a regular glide and gently start to exhale.
Maintain this position for a few seconds until you feel stable.
• Raise the eyes to look straight ahead, tilting the head slightly
backward. Keep the arms extended and release the knees.
• Actively press the head, neck and shoulders down, hollow the
chest and allow the head to lead the rest of the body in a
forward and slightly downward direction (10a). Straighten the
legs with some force, contract the abdominals to lift the hips,
which then follow the movement of the upper body towards
the floor (10b).
• Keeping the arms extended, gradually look upwards towards
the surface. Open the chest and allow the body to glide
forward and up towards the surface.
• When your eyes see the surface of the water from below, tuck

--- Page 57 Text ---
• When your eyes see the surface of the water from below, tuck
in the head and regain your feet (10c).
Remember The downward movement is active and the upward
is passive. Flow through the movement (little effort is required)
and allow the hips and lower back to move in a wave-like
action. As you descend, exhale through the nose to avoid the
unpleasant sensation of water flooding the sinuses.
Avoid Do not shorten the arms to pull the body down, or
breathe out too forcefully as this will make it harder to float
back up. Do not pull the head back too far as you come up.
Swimming different strokes
To appreciate the wider health benefits of swimming, it is
important to swim a combination of strokes. Apart from working
different parts of the body, each stroke engages the brain in
different ways and produces differing sensations. Although
some people clearly have an affinity or preference for a certain
stroke, no stroke is intrinsically more difficult than another.
Unless there is a medical reason for avoiding a stroke (such as
a hip replacement, which makes the breaststroke leg action
unsafe), we all have the capacity to perform each stroke in a
relaxed and confident way. Many people with chronic back
conditions believe that they must avoid the breaststroke and
butterfly. In my experience, swimming these strokes with the
Shaw Method can do more to relieve back pain than back or
front crawl. If you are in doubt, talk to a health professional
about your concerns.
CHECKPOINTS
• Are there other physical activities that you approach in
an unthinking way?
• What are the factors that affect your ability to float?
• Are you aware of day-to-day situations in which you pull
your head back?

--- Page 58 Text ---
your head back?
• Can you think of circumstances when it is appropriate to
hold your breath?

BREASTSTROKE
WITH EASE

‘The gentle undulation and glide helps to unwind the body
and clear the mind.’

Deborah Stevens, registered Shaw Method teacher

--- Page 60 Text ---
Breaststroke has existed since prehistoric times. Stone Age
paintings featuring a similar stroke were found in the ‘cave of
swimmers’ near Wadi Sora in Egypt. It was the only stroke
permitted during the great plague in the Middle Ages, because
swimmers could keep their faces out of the water and therefore
would not, it was believed, spread the epidemic.
Breaststroke was also the preferred stroke in Victorian
Britain, where an overarm action was deemed inelegant and
unsuitable for ladies and gentlemen. It was the original
competitive stroke and was popularized by Captain Webb who,
in 1875, became the first man to swim the English Channel.
In the UK and many other parts of the world, breaststroke
remains the most popular stroke today. Its relative stability,
with the arms and legs working in tandem, makes it accessible
to swimmers of all levels. For many, its appeal is the long glide
where the arms and legs are still as the swimmer advances;
others appreciate that it strengthens and tones their legs, whilst
some choose it as the best means of keeping their hair dry!
Breaststroke is easy to swim but hard to swim well; despite
its popularity few are able to perform the stroke in a way that
promotes good overall ‘use’. Many swim with their heads held
up out of the water, placing great pressure on the spine. Even if
people swim with their face in the water, they rarely have an
effective arm and leg action or good timing.
Furthermore, because most have swum this stroke regularly
since childhood, detrimental habits have become so strongly
ingrained that the prospect of change is more challenging than
with a less familiar stroke.
There is little point in tinkering with individual elements of
the stroke: the best recipe for success is to recraft it from
scratch. The following three breaststroke lessons take you
through a series of practices covering the core elements of the
stroke. Only when you have firmly established an effective arm
and leg action are you ready to progress to the more complex
process of coordinating the stroke and integrating the breath.

--- Page 61 Text ---
Shaw Method key features
Orientation Low, both in the glide, where the neck is fully
extended with the eyes looking straight down, and in the
breathing position, where the chin rests near the surface.
Arm action In the initial glide position, the arms are directed
slightly downward. Little effort is expended in the opening
phase as the upper back widens; in the propulsive movement,
the focus is on holding the water to draw the torso forward and
up, as opposed to pulling the arms back.
Leg action We stress the importance of the non-propulsive
element of the leg action, where the legs release before actively
pushing back. We advocate a wide, wedge-like action as
opposed to the narrower, more common whip kick, because it
promotes hip mobility and reduces the risk of knee injury.
Rhythm In the competitive model, where the objective is to
move into the propulsive actions as quickly as possible, a long
glide is perceived as a waste of time. Breaststroke according to
the Shaw Method is a series of glides punctuated by active
movements. The glide is at the heart of the stroke, giving the
swimmer more time to release the breath and lengthen and
widen the back.
Benefits
Breaststroke can improve the mobility of many joints including
the hips, shoulders, ankles, wrists and spine. As a leg-dominant
stroke, the breaststroke strengthens and tones the quadriceps
at the front of the legs and the hamstrings at the back. This is
also the reason why breaststroke can be an effective way of
improving aerobic fitness, as despite being the slowest stroke, it
burns the most calories. Many find the long glide, where the
swimmer gently exhales, particularly calming and meditative.
Because of the inherent stability of the stroke, it is often a
comfortable way to begin to explore the transition between air
and water.

Risks and common mistakes
Alignment
1. The common practices of craning the neck and snatching it
out of the water to breathe puts strain on the spine and can
create a whiplash-type injury.
2. Permanently holding the head high, both in the glide and the
breathing phases, increases drag/resistance as well stiffening
the neck and creating a hump. For every inch the head is lifted,
the hips sink two inches.
3. In competitive breaststroke, coaches encourage swimmers to
hunch their shoulders in order to maximize the streamlining of
the body, usually resulting in poor posture and shallow
breathing.
Timing
1. Many swimmers have difficultly coordinating this stroke, and
the arm and leg actions are often executed simultaneously. This
not only reduces the propulsive effects of the limbs, but
produces a concertina-like effect which strains the back.
2. Hurriedly pulling the heels towards the seat can also injure
the lower back.
3. A short glide does not provide sufficient time to exhale
comfortably, which can give rise to an erratic breathing pattern
and even to hyperventilation.
Propulsion
1. If you apply too much effort to open the arms, and open
them too wide, it not only increases drag but can also
significantly reduce the effectiveness of the arm action.
2. Most knee injuries are related to the use of the whip kick
(see glossary). ‘Breaststroker’s knee’ is the result of repeated
stress on the medial collateral ligament.
3. A lack of awareness or inflexibility in either hip hinders the
ability to produce a symmetrical leg action. The resulting ‘screw
kick’ not only produces an uneven thrust and twist of the spine,
but once established it is very difficult to unlearn.

--- Page 63 Text ---
but once established it is very difficult to unlearn.
LESSON 1: ARM ACTION
The sculling arm action (see glossary) in breaststroke promotes
flexibility of the wrist, elbow and shoulder joints. It is an ideal
antidote to the sustained arm position of many keyboard users,
which often results in repetitive strain injury (RSI). Similar fluid
arm movements are also integral to martial arts.
The aim of this lesson is to develop a smooth, rhythmical
and effective arm action. Unlike front crawl and backstroke,
where the upper body is dominant, breaststroke is leg-
dominant and the main purpose of the arms is to elevate the
torso to facilitate inhalation. This action, during which the hands
remain submerged, has four phases: extension, opening out,
the pull–lift phase, and recovery. The key to achieving an
effective arm action is to apply minimal effort during the non-
propulsive phases and the appropriate amount of drive during
the propulsive phase.
This lesson takes you through a series of practices that cover
the component parts of the arm action, showing you how to
time and coordinate them correctly. To avoid stressing the neck
and back, the face remains in the water during horizontal
practices. Remember: as breaststroke is a leg-dominant stroke,
it is unnecessary to apply a lot of effort with the arms.
1. Scooping
This practice can be performed in the pool or on dry land. The
aim is to coordinate the various phases of the arm action
without hunching the shoulders or narrowing the back. As a
stationary practice, it encourages you to focus on the quality of
movement without the distraction of achieving forward motion.

--- Page 64 Text ---
• Start in the opening stance; maintain this position for a few
seconds to achieve balance and stability.
• Extend the arms forward and slightly down, elbows below
shoulders, wrists below elbows, fingers below wrists, hands
side by side, palms down (1a). The head-neck-back should be
well aligned with the eyes looking at the hands; the breathing
relaxed and continuous throughout.
• Count to three, then gently rotate your palms outward and
begin to open your arms (1b), starting the movement across
the back, until they arrive just beyond shoulder width by the
count of five. Maintain the length of the arms and the depth of
the hands.
• On the count of six, rotate the wrists so that the palms are
facing inwards and actively scoop the hands in towards the
stomach. By the count of seven, the hands should have
formed a loose, cupping position just below the ribs (1c).
• On the count of eight, direct the hands forward and down,
until the arms are fully lengthened without locking elbows,
with the palms facing down and the hands together (1a). With
the eyes looking straight ahead, maintain a balanced,
lengthened position for two beats. Repeat the sequence.

--- Page 65 Text ---
Remember Stand tall, keeping the neck long and the eyes
looking straight ahead. Perform the opening phases with
minimal effort. Think about the lower back staying back and
relax the hands as the arms move forward.
Avoid Do not lock the arms and angle them up in the initial
extension and recovery phases. Do not collapse the chest as the
arms open out. Do not hunch the shoulders or bring the elbows
behind the torso in the scooping phase.
2. Stepping
This practice, in addition to reinforcing the correct arm action,
will develop your appreciation of the connection between arms
and breathing pattern. Here the objective is to utilize the
resistance of the water to pull the body forward, as opposed to
sweeping the arms backwards. It requires you to synchronize
the movement of the arms with a step – a good foundation to
draw upon during the later stages of coordinating the arm and
leg actions.
• Step forward with the right leg and simultaneously extend the
arms forward and down as you start to exhale gently (2a).
• With your weight spread evenly on both feet, widen the back
and open the arms, continuing to exhale slowly (2b).
• With a scooping arm action, bring the left foot forward in line
with the other leg. Allow the air to come in through the mouth
(2c).
• Breathe out as you step forward with the left foot and
simultaneously extend your arms; both feet now share your
weight equally.
• Repeat the sequence with the other foot leading, noticing any
differences.
Remember In the opening phase, maintain the length of the
arms. Keep the head centred and the neck long throughout.
Take your time – there is no need to hurry.
Avoid Do not step forward out of sequence, i.e. before the

--- Page 66 Text ---
arms start their recovery. Do not sweep the arms back.
3. Step and glide
In breaststroke, the glide is very much at the heart of the

--- Page 67 Text ---
In breaststroke, the glide is very much at the heart of the
stroke and this practice reinforces its importance. For many
people, the process of lengthening along the spine is easier to
recognize when they are standing up than when they are face
down in the water. Here the smooth transition between vertical
and horizontal is a reminder to lengthen in the water.
• Start as in the previous practice and perform one complete
cycle of the combined arm and stepping practice. Pause at the
end of the sequence (3a).
• Begin to exhale as you shift your weight on to the right foot
and with the head leading, angle the body down into a well-
balanced glide with the eyes looking at the floor. Ensure that
the front foot makes full contact with the floor and is carrying
your body weight before launching off (3b).
• Maintain the glide for a few seconds as you allow the water to
support you; lengthen and widen your back (3c).
• Tuck to regain the feet and then repeat the action with the
left leg leading.
Remember You may be surprised by how far you travel – the
momentum gained by stepping into the glide is quite significant.
Keep the hands soft throughout.
Avoid Do not stumble as a result of not putting the foot down
firmly before taking off. Do not snatch a breath or pull the head
back when going into the glide.
4. Floating arms

--- Page 68 Text ---
4. Floating arms
The aim of this practice is to move from an extended glide into
the opening-out phase whilst maintaining the length and
direction of the arms. This action creates a stable base prior to
the application of propulsive effort.
• Step forward into a well-balanced glide, with thumbs touching
and palms face down. Maintain this position as you breathe
out for three or four seconds (4a).
• Gently rotate your palms outwards and begin to float the
arms apart so that they are a little wider than the width of
your shoulders. Do not apply much effort: a good analogy
here is to imagine lengthening a fine thread (4b).
• Maintain this position for a further 3–4 seconds before tucking
to regain your feet. If you float well and have the ability to
relax your breathing, you can repeat this practice two or three
times before regaining your feet.
Remember Imagine balancing on a narrow beam when the
hands are together and on a wider beam when they are apart.
Allow this widening movement to originate from the back.
Avoid Do not raise the head, tense the arms or sweep them
back.
5. Arm action
This practice integrates the different arm movements on the
horizontal plane and requires the ability to trickle breathe (see
glossary). Without the distraction of the leg action, you can give
the quality of this movement your full attention.
• Inhale lightly and launch into a stable glide; maintain for
three seconds with a free neck and the eyes looking straight
down. Breathe out gently (5a).
• Widen the back and slide the arms apart to just beyond
shoulder width, palms and eyes down; continue to breathe
out gently (5b).

--- Page 69 Text ---
out gently (5b).
• Scoop the hands and forearms down and towards each other
(5c). The palms come together just in front of the chest (5d).
Continue to exhale.
• Extend the arms forward and down, until they are fully
lengthened with the palms facing down and hands together.
Continue the exhalation in a stable glide for a further three
seconds and regain the feet.
• Repeat the practice twice before regaining the feet. Be sure to
breathe out gently.
Remember Maintain the head-neck-back alignment with your
face in the water throughout. If your feet sink, lower the head a
little or paddle to keep them up.
Avoid Do not exhale explosively, as this reduces your ability to
float. Do not pull the elbows behind the shoulders, as it narrows
the upper back and encourages arching. Do not lock the arms
or direct them upward in the recovery.

--- Page 70 Text ---
LESSON 2: LEG ACTION
As people age, their range of motion, particularly of the hips,
knees and ankles, tends to reduce and many develop arthritis
from wear and tear. The inflexibility of these weight-bearing
joints is often cited as a major reason for the increasing number
of hip and knee replacements. Most do very little in their daily
lives to promote suppleness in these areas and without targeted
flexibility exercises, the abductor muscles around these joints
inevitably seize up over time.
An efficient breaststroke leg action is a simple and effective
way to maintain the health of the hip joint and promote overall
leg flexibility.
In Japanese culture, the common practice of sitting on the
floor requires significant hip abduction (movement away from
the centre-line), which results in lower rates of arthritis in the

--- Page 71 Text ---
the centre-line), which results in lower rates of arthritis in the
lower limbs. It is no coincidence that the Japanese are
particularly adept at breaststroke and their swimmers have had
a great deal of success in this stroke.
The leg action provides most of the forward thrust in
breaststroke, producing around 70 per cent of the overall
propulsion. The symmetrical action of the legs resembles the
movement of a swimming frog – hence the term ‘frog kick’. In
competitive swimming, a narrow, streamlined leg action known
as the whip kick is favoured.
In the Shaw Method, a wider action, which places less stress
on the knees, is preferred. This movement consists of two
phases: the preparatory phase and the thrust phase.
• Preparatory From the glide with the legs extended
backward, the ankles are released to allow the feet to turn
slightly outward. The heels are drawn gently towards the
posterior as the thighs and knees are turned out.
• Thrust The legs are driven backwards and inwards to the
glide position, gaining force and pace throughout the
movement. Propulsion is gained through a combination of
driving the legs back and drawing them together.

Sy

--- Page 72 Text ---
In an effective leg action, the feet change plane. They move
from being close to the surface of the water during the glide, to
a few inches below the surface, and then back up in a wave-like
motion.
In the following practices, the legs are isolated from the
arms, enabling you to focus on this critical aspect of the stroke.
Separating the arm and leg actions is also an effective means of
breaking the unhelpful pattern of moving them simultaneously.
1. Leg extension
This practice promotes flexibility in the hip, thigh and groin
areas, which is essential in an effective breaststroke leg action.
It also highlights the importance of good alignment.
• Stand in shallow water, at right angles to the edge of the
pool. Extend the right arm and rest it on the poolside; ensure
that the right foot is firmly on the floor, facing forwards.
• Release the left arm so it rests by the left hip and rotate the
torso to the left. Take the left foot off the floor and allow it to
lengthen as it floats up (1a).
• Keep the right hand firmly in contact with the side as the left
leg rises and extends. Point the toes in line with the leg.
Remember Free the neck and head in continuation of the spine
and allow the leg to lengthen out from the hip.
Avoid Do not lift the leg too high and arch the back, twist the
back, push the head down, or twist the front foot so that the
toes turn inward.
2. Sumo stance
This practice familiarizes you with turning both feet out evenly
and opening the hips into what is for most an unfamiliar, frog-
like position. It promotes a symmetrical leg action – one of the
hallmarks of an efficient breaststroke. It also addresses the
importance of not arching the back as the knees bend.
• Think of releasing the neck and place the hands on the side of

--- Page 73 Text ---
• Think of releasing the neck and place the hands on the side of
the pool. Stand facing the poolside, a little way away from it,
in water no deeper than chest level. The knees should be hip-
width apart, and the feet turned out slightly and away from
the wall.
• Bend the knees and direct them outward as you lower
yourself a few inches. The inner knees should make light
contact with the wall.
• Gently press the knees into the wall. Notice a gentle stretch
running along the inside of the thighs and hips (2a).
• Continue to exert gentle pressure for 10 seconds before
standing up to full height and relaxing both legs. Repeat this
practice at least three times.
Remember Direct knees outward, keep heels in contact with
the floor, ensure that the tailbone drops aways and the knees
move in ine with the toes.
Avoid Do not hollow the back or twist the pelvis. Do not exert
more pressure on one side or turn either foot inward. Do not let
the head fall forward or pull it back.

--- Page 74 Text ---
3. Supported frog
Here, comfortably supported by the side of the pool, you can
gently practice the full leg action with a clear view and without
the distraction of trying to get anywhere. It clearly emphasizes
the difference between the releasing and active phases of the
leg action. This practice works particularly well in deck-level
pools.
• Stand with your back against the corner of the pool. Place the
elbows on the side of the pool and lift the legs to float just
below the surface. Extend the legs and maintain this position
for four beats (3a).
• Release the ankles and knees (so they drop a few inches),
gently draw the feet into the frog position and breathe in. Pay
attention to establishing and maintaining symmetry (3b).
• Push outward with the soles (3c), then turn the feet inwards
and actively bring both legs towards each other; exhale gently
(3a). Maintain the extension for four beats whilst continuing

--- Page 75 Text ---
(3a). Maintain the extension for four beats whilst continuing
to breathe out gently.
Remember Release the hips and stomach muscles in the first
phase and contract them in the dynamic phase.
Avoid Do not snatch the legs in forcefully, as this will sabotage
the propulsive phase.
4. Frog with the face down
Here, the non-propulsive phase of the leg action is practiced
separately. When you are on your front, it can be hard to avoid
following the unhelpful pattern of the feet breaking the surface,
but here you have an opportunity to correct this before putting
any effort into the leg action, which can be injurious if the legs
are too high in the water.
In full breaststroke, this phase corresponds to the opening
and scooping of the arms and therefore needs to be slow
enough to allow sufficient time to perform both arm
movements.

--- Page 76 Text ---
• Step forward, extend the arms and drift off into a glide with
the feet together, arms directed forward and down, and eyes
looking straight down. Maintain this glide for four beats.
• Turn the toes out, release the ankles and knees, and slowly
draw the heels towards the posterior (4a).
• Maintain this position for four beats. Lengthen and draw both
legs together without thrusting, then regain the feet.
• Repeat the frog with face down sequence until it is balanced,
with both feet symmetrical.
Remember Think about primary control, and opening the legs

--- Page 77 Text ---
without effort. Keep both feet submerged at all times.
Avoid Do not lift the head or arch the back, pull the feet up
with effort or bring them up to the posterior (this can strain the
lower back).
5. One leg at a time
This practice familiarizes you with the movement of the legs
while you are on your front. By working a single leg, it is easier
to tell if there are any differences between the left and right
side. It is also a helpful way to work on the tempo of the leg
action.
• Stand at 90° to the wall of the pool, in water no deeper than
shoulder height.
• Place the left hand on the side of the pool, the left foot on the
floor, and rotate the right hip outwards to allow the right foot
to float behind with the toes pointed (5a).
• Release the right leg so it sinks a few inches and rotate the
ankle joint to turn the foot out.
• Release the right knee and gently draw the foot towards your
seat. Pause for a couple of seconds (5b).
• In a single continuous movement, actively thrust the right leg

--- Page 78 Text ---
• In a single continuous movement, actively thrust the right leg
out until it is fully extended and then draw it back towards the
centre.
• Repeat five times with the right leg and then change to the
left, noting any differences.
Remember Direct the knee and foot outwards as the head
remains centred.
Avoid Do not shorten the neck, actively draw in the leg instead
of releasing it, or turn the knee of the standing leg inward.

--- Page 79 Text ---
6. Complete leg action
In this practice, the arms do not move but their position is vital
to the functioning of the legs. If they are placed too high, this
will arch the back, making it harder to generate propulsive force
(it is also potentially injurious). If you tend to move the arms
and legs together, you may feel a compulsion to bend the arms
when the legs start to move: this must be avoided.
• Launch into a glide, point the toes and extend the legs
without locking the knees.
• Turn the feet out to allow the ankles, knees and hips to rotate
outwards. Release the ankles and knees, and draw the feet
towards the seat as the hips widen (6a).
• Sequence: ankles, knees and then hips in one gentle,

--- Page 80 Text ---
• Sequence: ankles, knees and then hips in one gentle,
controlled movement. Maintain the second glide for four beats
and then stand before repeating.
• Drive the feet back and out. As the knees straighten, turn and
point the feet and draw the legs together into a glide (6b).
Remember Observe how an effective kick allows the whole
body to be directed dynamically forward in one horizontal plane,
with your head leading.
Avoid Do not shorten the arms as the knees bend, make an
uneven or screw kick, or pull the head back. If one ankle or hip
is stiff, it may be difficult to achieve a symmetrical leg action,
which will inevitably push the body off balance.
LESSON 3: TIMING AND BREATHING
Timing
When working to establish the correct timing in breaststroke, it
is useful to remember the function of the arms and legs. The
primary purpose of the arms is to lift your body forward and up,
and the role of the legs is to push you forward and down. So
the objective, when combining arms and legs, is to release the
legs as the arms perform their propulsive action, and to extend
the arms when the legs thrust. Never open the arms until the
legs are closed. The body is travelling at maximum velocity at
the end of the leg action, so enjoy the glide.
Breathing
During the glide, a gradual exhalation through the mouth takes
place underwater. The face is elevated to breathe, which is the
combined result of a scooping arm action, which raises the
upper body, and the release of the knees, which causes the hips
to descend. A minimal movement of the head is all that is
required to comfortably inhale through the mouth at the end of
the pull–lift phase.
1. Chair practice

--- Page 81 Text ---
1. Chair practice
Before attempting to combine the arm and leg action in the
water, it is helpful to practise on dry land. Standing upright, you
can work for a sustained period on coordination, timing and
rhythm without having to stop to take a breath.
• Stand in front of a chair with the arms extended, feet spread
around hip-width apart and turned out, and legs extended to
the count of 1, 2, 3, 4 (1a).
• Open the arms gently and broaden across the back (count 5,
6) (1b).
• Release the wrists and scoop the hands in towards the
stomach. Bend the elbows (7) and then the knees (8) to sit at
the edge of the chair (1c).
• Push up with the legs (9) and extend the arms forward (10),
with the eyes looking straight ahead (1a). Repeat this until
the timing feels comfortable, then remove the chair and
perform the action without support. This practice also works
well standing in water.
Remember Arms lead the first part of the stroke and the legs

--- Page 82 Text ---
lead the second. Keep the heels in contact with the floor
throughout.
Avoid Do not lean forwards, sway backwards, bend the knees
before the arms have started their scoop, or finish the arm
extension before the legs start to straighten.
2. Glide – arms and legs
Here you return to the previous lessons to consolidate your
learning. Since it has been a while since you worked on the
glide and arm actions, it is a good idea to re-familiarize yourself
with them before attempting to combine the two.
• Step into the glide with the eyes looking down at the floor and
the crown of the head leading. Maintain the glide for 4–5
seconds before regaining the feet.
• Perform one complete sequence of arm movements with the
face in the water and legs together. Regain the feet.
• Perform one complete sequence of leg actions with the arms
extended and regain the feet.
• Return to the glide and repeat the sequence of glide, stand;
arms, stand; legs, stand at least three times.
Remember Think about the quality and tempo of each
separate action in isolation, breathing out gently when the face
is submerged.
Avoid Do not shorten the neck, perform more than one leg or
arm action each time, or move the legs when working on the
arms and vice versa.
3. Arm with legs
Having revised the separate elements, you are now ready to
integrate them. Here it is useful to remind yourself that the
breaststroke is a leg-dominant stroke, and to avoid putting too
much effort into the arm action. If you are dissatisfied with any
part of the action, ignore the temptation to repeat it before
regaining your feet – it is far better to stand up and start the

--- Page 83 Text ---
regaining your feet – it is far better to stand up and start the
movement again.
• Breathe in gently, step forward and drift into a glide. Breathe
out lightly and maintain this position, with hands together and
palms facing down, for a count of 1, 2, 3, 4 (3a).
• Gently rotate the hands outwards and open them to shoulder-
width apart. Maintain your head position, with the eyes
looking straight down, and continue to exhale (5, 6) (3b).
• Relax the wrists and scoop towards the torso. Turn the feet
out and draw the heels effortlessly towards the seat (7, 8)
(3c).
• Extend the feet out and away, pushing the water with the
whole of the feet. Close the legs (9) and lengthen the arms
forward and down into the water (10) (3d).
Remember Perform a pulling action with the arms, followed by
a push from the legs. It is easier to coordinate the two if you
move slowly.

--- Page 85 Text ---
Avoid Do not execute arm and leg actions at the same time,
apply too much effort with the arms or legs, or lift the head to
inhale.
4. Rolling the head
The Alexander Technique emphasizes the importance of a free
neck and the dangers of forcefully pulling the head back. This is
sometimes misinterpreted as meaning that there is a correct
position in which to hold the head. A free neck allows you to
move the head from side to side and up and down, not to hold
it in a fixed position. The ability to nod freely is vital in
achieving an effective breathing position in breaststroke. Locate

--- Page 86 Text ---
achieving an effective breathing position in breaststroke. Locate
your so-called ‘nodding’ joint before you do this practice. Place
the tips of your fore-fingers just beneath your ears and gently
nod your head, notice that your fingers do not move.
• Standing with feet together and arms by your sides, tilt
forward and inhale lightly (4a).
• Look down at floor, lengthening the neck and gently breath
out to the count of 1, 2, 3.
• Roll the head so that the eyes are raised, continuing to exhale
(count 4, 5) (4b).
• Raise the chin in line with the shoulders and allow air to come
in through the mouth (6, 7).
• Bow the head, allowing the forehead to lead the movement
(8, 9) and begin to exhale (4a). Repeat this series of
movements a number of times until the nodding joint feels
free.
• It is beneficial to perform this practice on dry land first, and
then in the pool with the water level at shoulder height, and
the face moving in and out of the water.

--- Page 87 Text ---
Remember Pivot at the nodding joint (atlanto-occipital joint),
ease the head slowly upward then move it back down more
quickly.
Avoid Do not lift the head forcefully, arch the back, fix the hips,
push air out vigorously or gasp.

--- Page 88 Text ---
5. Walking breaststroke
The combination of the stepping practice from lesson 1 and the
previous nodding practice enables you to integrate the
breathing pattern with the stroke before having to negotiate the
more tricky transition between water and air.
• Breathe in lightly, begin to exhale and step forward with the
right leg, arms extended, head angled to look towards the
floor (count 1, 2, 3) (5a).
• With your weight evenly spread on both feet, raise the head,
looking just above the hands and continue to exhale (count 4)

--- Page 89 Text ---
looking just above the hands and continue to exhale (count 4)
(5b).
• Maintain this head position and gently open the arms (5, 6).
Watch the hands open and continue with the gentle
exhalation, weight still evenly spread (5c).
• Scoop the hands inward (5d) and rise gradually on to tiptoes,
shifting your weight to the front foot. With the scooping
action, allow air to come in through the mouth (7, 8).
• Bow the head, with the gaze directed towards the floor, and
begin to exhale (9). Extend the arms and step forward with
the left leg; continue to breathe out (10).
Remember The head movement leads the arm action; inhale
passively through the mouth.

--- Page 91 Text ---
Avoid Do not pull the head back, gasp, look down forcefully or
step as the arms open.
6. One complete stroke
This practice coordinates all the elements in one complete
stroke cycle. It is helpful to pause at the end of each cycle to
focus on integrating the elements.
• Inhale lightly and drift off into a glide with the eyes looking
towards the floor (count 1, 2, 3); exhale into the water (6a).
• Continue to exhale as the head rolls, raising the eyes to look
just above the hands (4). The nose and mouth remain
submerged.
• Widen the back and open the hands (5, 6), still breathing out
gently.
• Gently draw the feet drawn towards the seat, raise the head
to bring the nose and mouth clear of the water (8); open the

--- Page 92 Text ---
to bring the nose and mouth clear of the water (8); open the
mouth and allow the air in (6b).
• Bow the head into the water (9) and start to exhale (6c).
• Extend the legs as the arms reach forward and down into the
water (10). Close the legs, maintain a glide for four beats and
regain your feet.
Remember Roll the neck before opening the arms. A minimal
movement of the head is enough to inhale comfortably.
Submerge the face before thrusting the legs.
Avoid Do not lift the head and shoulders too high (the chin
should be at the surface on inhalation). Do not breathe in
forcefully or break into a second stroke.
7. Two complete strokes
By producing the action a second time, you gain more
awareness of the breathing process. You also experience the
wave-like motion that smoothly connects one stroke with the
next.
• Inhale lightly and breathe out gently into a glide. Roll the
head to raise the eyes, open the hands, scoop with the arms
as the pelvis drops with the frog action of the feet, and inhale
gently.
• In a continuous movement, bow the head, thrust and close
the legs as the arms extend (propels the body forward and
down).
• Feel the natural wave-like undulation, allowing the water to
lift you before rolling the head and commencing the second

--- Page 93 Text ---
lift you before rolling the head and commencing the second
stroke.
• Perform one more full stroke, ending up in a long glide, and
regain the feet.
Remember Inhale towards the end of the scoop. One stroke
flows into the next with head and hips working in concert.
Avoid Do not disturb the head-neck-back relationship, exhale
forcefully, tense the pelvis and lower back, or lift the head too
high out of the water to inhale.
8. Continuous full stroke
Here are some helpful points to remember when swimming
continuously. Think of the breaststroke as a series of glides
punctuated by a stroke; the objective is to flow from one glide
to the next. When you perform the full stroke it is not advisable
to focus on individual elements of it. These are better perfected
in the separate practices – here your attention should be on the
movement as a whole.
Body orientation: In the horizontal plane, achieve a stable,
balanced glide with the neck free and the arms directed down.
In the breathing position, ensure that the lower back is released
with the eyes looking straight ahead, not upward.
Timing: The propulsive action of the arms in the first part of
the action leads you to elevate and inhale, and the thrust of the
legs in the second part of the stroke leads you to breathe out as
the body is propelled forward and down.
Breathing: Pay attention to the quality of the out-breath,
making sure it is gentle and continuous; allow the in-breath to
happen by itself. The inhalation only takes a split second,
whereas with your face in the water the out-breath is much
longer.
Remember Move from one stroke to the next in a consistent
and coordinated manner, enjoying the sense of non-doing in the

--- Page 94 Text ---
glide.
Avoid Do not push air out forcefully. Instead of trying to empty
your lungs, deliberately retain some oxygen to make it easier to
float to the surface for the next inhalation.
One complete stroke
1. Angle the arms downwards, lengthen and widen the back,
breathe out gently and look at the floor.
2. Tilt the head with the eyes leading, release the hips, open
the arms just beyond shoulder width with elbows slightly bent.
3. Scoop the arms, release the legs and gently draw the feet
towards the posterior and passively inhale.
4. Bow the head, thrust with the legs, extend the arms, and
exhale.

--- Page 96 Text ---
Throughout the book, the words ‘backstroke’ and ‘back crawl’
are used interchangeably to refer to the same stroke.
People have swum on their back since the earliest times:
both the Romans and Greeks enjoyed a form of backstroke. The
origins of today’s backstroke include the elementary
backstroke, which involved an overarm recovery and a
breaststroke leg action. This inverted form of breastroke was
very popular in Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries, and is sometimes referred to as Old English
backstroke.
It was not until the twentieth century that modern-day back
crawl was invented. In the 1912 Olympics, Harry Hebner
shocked the world when he unveiled this revolutionary way of
swimming on the back and beat his rivals by more than three
seconds.
The modern back crawl, which has an alternating overarm
action and up and down leg action, resembles an upside-down
front crawl. Unlike its predecessor, it is an upper-body-
dominant stroke, with most of the propulsion being generated
by the strong wing-like muscles of the upper back under each
arm.
At no point during an effective backstroke is it necessary to
submerse the face, and for this reason it helps to build
confidence in the water for the less experienced. The head and
spine remain centred, with the head fully supported by the
water, while the hips and shoulders rotate rhythmically,
encouraging free-flowing mobility of the hip and shoulder joints.
Success in backstroke can best be achieved by blending the
three Rs: relaxation, rhythm and rotation.
Shaw Method key features
Orientation The body rotates to the side, with the hips and
shoulders rolling around a central axis – the spine. There is a
strong sense of leading with the head, with the emphasis on

--- Page 97 Text ---
maintaining stillness through releasing the neck, rather than
holding the head still.
Arm action One arm remains extended as the second elevates
(not like a windmill). The emphasis is on the thumb leading the
arm recovery and the little finger entering the water first. The
extended arm leads and assists balance and stability.
Leg action The pace of the leg action is steady, with emphasis
on the forward and upward action. The legs are extended while
keeping the ankles loose throughout.
Rhythm There are four to six leg beats to every arm cycle. The
recovery and anchoring phases are slow, with an acceleration
occurring as one arm pushes back and the other enters the
water.
Benefits
Swimming on your back benefits postural awareness, promoting
a sense of lengthening and widening. As the weight of the head
is fully supported by the water, the neck can release easily.
Backstroke strengthens the back, tones the legs and arms
without putting strain on the spine, and increases hip and
shoulder mobility. Many enjoy a feeling of expansion along the
sides of the body, which results from the rotational movements.
These rotations provide a good base for developing an efficient
front crawl. The backcrawl arm action also complements the
forward motion of frontcrawl
Risks and common mistakes
Alignment
1. Lifting the head unduly causes strain and increases drag,
while letting it fall backwards can give rise to the inhalation of
water.
2. If a swimmer does not rotate the hips sufficiently, shoulder
mobility is reduced, causing strain and potential injury.
Timing

--- Page 98 Text ---
Timing
1. The common pattern of moving both arms at the same time
reduces purchase on the water and is a hard habit to break.
2. The breathing pattern is less obvious than in the other
strokes, and despite the fact that the face is out of the water,
many people have difficulty coordinating their breathing.
Propulsion
1. Failure to release the upper arm before attempting to hold
the water can cause a serious injury to the rotator cuff (see
glossary).
2. In walking, we are so used to leading with the knees that it is
challenging to maintain the length of the leg as it presses
upwards.
LESSON 1: ORIENTATION AND LEG ACTION
When swimming on their back, many people enjoy being
supported by the water, while others feel a lack of control. Any
feelings of uncertainty are compounded by not being able to see
ahead. This also makes practice more difficult and increases the
risk of injury through collision. This danger is reduced with the
Shaw Method as the lead arm is extended for longer periods,
leaving the head less exposed.
In the Shaw Method backstroke, the body is on a slight
incline, with the head a few inches higher than the hips. This
small deviation from the horizontal prevents the legs from
breaking the surface. The crown of the head remains in the
water throughout; lifting it would cause the hips to sink further,
thereby increasing drag. To let the head fall backwards would
arch the back and reduce the ability to gain propulsion from the
legs. As was discussed earlier, body rotation is vital, reducing
resistance and maximizing reach. The following simple practice
highlights the relationship between rotation and the movement
of the arm in backstroke.
• Stand up for a moment and step straight back with your right

--- Page 99 Text ---
• Stand up for a moment and step straight back with your right
foot as you simultaneously extend your right arm behind you.
Notice how far the arm extends and be aware of your
shoulder joint (photo X).
• Now repeat the practice, only this time rotate your right hip
and turn the foot to 90°. See how much further the arm
extends without causing any shoulder strain (photo Y).
People float on their back to varying degrees and the main
objective of this lesson is to find your optimum point of balance.
The head is buoyant, regardless of the way the rest of your
body floats, so explore allowing your neck to be free so that the
head is fully supported by the water. The other objective is to
learn to rotate the torso without disturbing the finely balanced
head-neck-back relationship.
Leg action
The leg action in back crawl is primarily for balance and
stability. This movement is generally seen as originating from
the hips; however in the Shaw Method, the movement of the
legs originates from the lower back. It is important to release
the lower back if the hips are to function freely.

--- Page 100 Text ---
the lower back if the hips are to function freely.
Although the arms are dominant in back crawl, the legs still
have two important functions: they stabilize the body, providing
rhythm, and contribute significantly to forward momentum,
generating around 35 per cent of overall propulsion. In the
Shaw Method, the alternating action of the legs is described as
a ‘leg press’ (which conveys their true function of maximizing
resistance) rather than ‘leg kick’ (which implies a more forceful,
less considered movement).
The leg bends slightly at the beginning of the action and
then lengthens as it accelerates upward towards the surface.
Turning the feet slightly inward promotes flexibility in the
ankles and improves the effectiveness of the leg action, giving
greater purchase on the water.
1. Seated leg press
On the poolside you can begin to explore the backstroke leg
action and discover when to release and when to apply effort.
Observe and feel the effectiveness of moving from the hips as
opposed to the knees.
• Sit on the poolside with your eyes looking ahead. Straighten
the legs and angle them down into the water. Place your
hands behind you as a support and slightly raise yourself,
shifting your weight forward.
• Release the left leg so that it is a few inches lower than the
right, then bend the knee slightly so the foot drops a little
further (1a).
• Straighten the left leg, moving the thigh first, and with toes
pointed, actively raise the foot to the surface. The right leg
should simultaneously drop a few inches.
• Bend the right knee slightly so that the foot drops a little
further. Then actively lift and extend the right leg as for the
left.
• Continue the sequence for a minute or two, notice how this
action works the stomach muscles as well as the legs.
• Contrast this action with one where you bend the knees to

--- Page 101 Text ---
• Contrast this action with one where you bend the knees to
perform a cycling action: notice how much less resistance is
generated.
Remember Make flowing movements, free the ankles, and
point the toes. Allow the legs to lengthen.
Avoid Do not over-bend the knees, arch or twist the back, or
poke the chin forward.
2. Leg action – standing
In an upright stance it is easier to notice how the leg action is
affected by your alignment. On the backward release the
objective is to reduce resistance and during the forward
movement the objective is to maximize it.
• Stand in shallow water by the side of the pool or on a step.
Place the left hand on the edge of the pool to steady yourself;
the right arm hangs freely.
• Stand tall, on tiptoes, and shift your weight on to the left leg.

--- Page 102 Text ---
• Stand tall, on tiptoes, and shift your weight on to the left leg.
Eyes at eye level.
• Remaining upright release the whole of the right leg back
from the hip joint and slightly bend the knee (2a).
• Extend the right leg forward, pointing the toes and
straightening the knee. Notice the resistance of the water as
you press the right leg forward until it is slightly in front of the
stationary one (2b).
• Repeat this action at least ten times before turning around
and performing the action with the left leg.
Remember Maintain an upright stance and move the leg as a
whole, the power being generated through the back and hips.
Avoid Do not actively bring the leg back, arch the back, lock
the hip or knee, or flex the foot instead of pointing it.

--- Page 103 Text ---
3. Leg action – swimming
This practice builds on the previous one, with the legs propelling
the body. In a stable, balanced position, explore how the
extended upward beat of the legs generates forward
momentum.
• Maintaining good alignment, lower yourself in the water – as if
to sit in a low chair – until the shoulders are submerged.
• Slowly lean backwards without poking the chin forward and
gradually glide on to the back. Keep your hands by your side,
shoulders relaxed, body on a slight incline with head higher
than hips, and legs straight with the toes pointed.
• Release the right leg, allowing it to drop a little. Moving the
left thigh, press upward with the whole leg. Force is generated
through the hips, knees and ankles (3a).
• Notice that as one leg directs upward, the other automatically
tends to release downward. Contrast the letting go phase with
the more active upward movements.
• Lift the legs alternately and continue for a few minutes. Notice
how releasing the neck gives you greater control of this

--- OCR from Page 103 Image 1 ---
da

--- Page 104 Text ---
how releasing the neck gives you greater control of this
movement. Regain the feet.
Remember Lengthen the legs as if to lift the water upwards.
The downward movement is a gentle release.
Avoid Do not rush, lead with the knee or bring the foot out of
the water. Do not move your head from side to side.
4. Sidestepping
The ability to rotate on to the side is fundamental to
backstroke. Initially, most people find this orientation
challenging, due to a lack of experience in moving side-on. This
practice familiarizes you with this new sensation, providing an
experience of moving through water in a streamlined way.
• Stand tall with body rotated to the left, head centred and eyes
front. Both hands should be resting by your sides with heels
together in L-shape (4a).
• With the body still rotated to the side take a small step
backwards with your left foot, and simultaneously extend the
left arm. Maintain the position of the head. (4b).
• Take a further five or six steps before changing to the other
side. Many people feel more at ease on one side; it is a good
idea to practise more on the less familiar side.
Remember Take small steps and maintain balance through
good contact with the floor.
Avoid Do not move the head up or down or from side to side,
hunching the shoulders.

--- Page 106 Text ---
5. Legs to the side
The benefits of streamlining are immediately apparent in this
practice, although it is more difficult to balance. The inherent
lack of stability in the practice makes it even more important to
achieve and maintain a good head-neck-back relationship.
• The eyes face away from the direction of travel. Step
backwards with your left foot and rotate your leg and torso
outwards (5a).
• Bend the left knee, lowering the head and shoulders towards
the surface; arms rest by your sides. Tilt the body so that the
right hip and shoulder are uppermost.
• Directing with the head, lean gradually into the water and
drift on to your left side with arms alongside the body. Look
straight up.
• With your head supported by the water and your body on its
side, perform the leg action, actively directing the legs to the
right for six beats (5b).
• Roll to a flat position on the back, centre yourself in neutral
and regain the feet. Repeat on the other side, noting any
differences.
Remember Keep your neck free, breathing easy, hips and
shoulders relaxed, and legs long.
Avoid Do not change the head position, kick backwards or lead
with the knee.

--- Page 107 Text ---
6. Centre to side rotation
Learn to rotate the body without turning the head. Most people
automatically turn their heads in tune with the rotation. Freeing
the neck is key to a stable head position.
• With shoulders parallel and hands resting by your sides,
perform six leg beats (6a).
• Pause the leg action and momentarily direct your gaze
upwards. Using the hips and shoulder, rotate on to your right
side (6b).
• Continue to move the legs for a further six beats and regain

--- Page 108 Text ---
• Continue to move the legs for a further six beats and regain
the feet.
• Perform the same series of movements rotating to the left.
• Notice any differences in terms of ability to balance and level
of propulsion.
Remember Make a smooth transition from side to centre,
hands and shoulders relaxed.
Avoid Do not allow the head to deviate from the centre-line as
the body rotates. Do not lead the leg action with the knee
(bicycling).
7. Arm extended
The objective is to let the arm grow out from the back rather
than simply stretch it. Discover how your overall alignment is
influenced by the direction of the arm, for example if it veers to
the right, the body tends to follow.
• Standing side on, step in the direction of travel with your left
leg, and extend your left arm. Bend the knees and gently
lower yourself in the water.

--- Page 109 Text ---
• Leading with the crown, lean into the water and drift on to
your side with your gaze directed up, and the lead arm
directed forward and angled slightly down (7a).
• The resting arm remains close to your side as if it is placed
deeply in a front pocket (7b).
• Maintaining a sideways orientation, perform ten leg beats.
• Draw the lead arm to your hip, roll your body to the centre
and regain your feet (7c).
Remember Think about the arm being connected to the back

--- Page 110 Text ---
as an aid to your sense of balance and stability.
Avoid Do not let the second arm drift away from your side, as
it causes over-rotation.
LESSON 2: ARM ACTION
Although back crawl is often considered an arm-dominant
stroke, it is not actually the arm muscles that generate most of
the propulsion. The arms operate as levers connected to the
powerful wing-like muscles of the upper back, which provide
most of the momentum for driving the body forward.
The arm action consists of four phases: extension, anchor,
propulsive, and recovery. An efficient backstroke arm action
requires the swimmer to understand when to apply effort and
when to release and conserve energy. Most of the effort needs
to be concentrated on the dynamic holding phase, with the
extension, hooking and recovery phases being significantly less
strenuous.
1. Single-arm stepping
By isolating one arm at a time, you can focus on the details of
each phase and connect them with the rotational movements of
the torso. It is useful to perform it on dry land as well as in the
pool.
• Extension phase Take a single step backwards with the left
leg, turning the foot out as you rotate the body.
Simultaneously extend the left arm and direct it down. Ensure
that the hand remains soft and is positioned to the left of the
shoulder (1a).
• Anchor phase Still standing with the right foot leading, bend
the left elbow and direct the upper arm away from the
shoulder as you move up on to tiptoes with the right foot
(1b). Centre the hips and shoulders.

--- Page 111 Text ---
• Propulsive phase With your left arm parallel to your left
shoulder, press it towards the left hip as you step backward

--- Page 112 Text ---
and rotate to your right. Ensure that you leave the right arm
alone.
• Recovery phase Elevate the left arm, leading with the
thumb, until it is parallel with your left shoulder; bend the left
knee and centre hips and shoulders (1c).
• Turn and rotate recovery Turn the hand so that the little
finger leads as you continue to make an 180° arc with the left
hand, ending up at its start position (extension phase).
Simultaneously step backwards with the left leg and rotate
the torso to the left (1d).
• Repeat the entire sequence six times and then perform it with
the right arm.
Remember The arm should float lightly through the air. Make
smooth, continuous movements of the arms, hips and
shoulders.
Avoid Do not bend the elbow during the recovery, turn and
rotate phases. Do not cross the mid-line, move the head or
tense the lead arm.
2. Single-arm backstroke
Like the previous practice, the single-arm backstroke brings the
focus on to the separate phases of the arm action, in reference
to the movement of the rest of the body.
You may be surprised to learn that it is possible to steer a
straight course with one arm, as long as the angle of the arm
during the propulsive phase is correct.
• Extension Launch off with the body rotated and right arm
extended in the direction of travel. Look upward as you start
the leg action. The left arm rests by your side throughout
(2a).
• Anchor Bend the right elbow to 90° and flex the wrist as you
direct the upper arm away from the shoulder. Simultaneously
turn from your side to the centre by rotating the hips and
shoulders (2b).

--- Page 114 Text ---
• Dynamic Press the right arm in an outward arc and then
inward towards the right hip, as the body rotates on to the
left side. Accelerate the legs at this point (2c).
• Recovery Without pausing, continue to flow into the
recovery, exiting the water with the thumb and entering with
the little finger as you rotate back to the right side (2d).
Repeat the whole sequence with the left arm.
Remember Keep the head still by freeing the neck. Apply force
in the pull-push phase. Make the rotations smooth and flowing.
Avoid Do not contract the arm in the hooking phase, bend the
arm or cross the mid-line during the recovery.
3. Floating arm – standing (land or water)
This practice establishes the relationship and timing between
the arms. It counters the common pattern in which both arms
are moved simultaneously like a windmill.

--- Page 115 Text ---
are moved simultaneously like a windmill.
• Starting in neutral, step back, extend the left leg and arm,
and lean slightly in the direction of travel.
• Recovery Leading with the thumb, slowly raise your right
arm until it is level with the shoulder whilst maintaining the
length and direction of the left arm.
• In order to remain balanced as the right arm lifts, extend the
left arm away in a downward direction.
• Repeat the practice on the other side, noting any differences.
Remember Imagine that the right arm is growing out from the
back as it floats up. Maintain primary control.
Avoid Do not lift the shoulders, or shorten the leading arm as
the other arm is raised.
4: Floating arm – swimming
This practice, which corresponds to the first part of the recovery
in full-stroke backstroke, cultivates balance and control. It
strongly encourages you to make the lifting phase light and to
lengthen the lead arm. Lifting the arm with too much effort, or
a lack of direction with the lead arm, will tend to push your
body down.
• Gently lower yourself into the water with the body rotated to
the left and the left arm extended.
• Allowing the head to be supported by the water, launch off on
your side with the left arm extended and directed slightly
down. Keep the right arm relaxed and close to the right thigh.
Start a steady, continuous leg action with the feet close
together (4a).
• After ten leg beats leading with the thumb, begin to elevate
the right hand slowly and gently as you consciously extend
the left arm, until the right hand approaches vertical above
the shoulder (4b). (Those who float lower in the water may
find it necessary to perform a vigorous leg action at the point
when the arm exits the water.) • After a further ten leg beats,

--- Page 116 Text ---
when the arm exits the water.) • After a further ten leg beats,
release the right arm and place the right hand back alongside
the thigh. Repeat the whole sequence once again, using the
left arm.
Remember The raised arm is connected with the upper back.
Keep the leg action long and loose.
Avoid Do not pull the head back and shorten the lead arm as
the second is raised.
LESSON 3: INTEGRATION
As was mentioned in the overview, one of the most significant
differences between the way that most people swim the
backstroke and the Shaw Method, relates to the timing of the
arm action. The relationship between one arm and the other
includes a pause of the extended arm until the second arm has
exited the water. This timing enables the swimmer to achieve a
good purchase on the water and to maximize the benefit of
each propulsive action by swiftly moving into the most
streamlined position.
Because the face is continuously out of the water, breathing
is often overlooked. In the full stroke, it is important to
coordinate breathing with the movement of the arms. I suggest

--- OCR from Page 116 Image 1 ---
da

--- Page 117 Text ---
coordinate breathing with the movement of the arms. I suggest
that you inhale on the first part of the recovery, as the thumb
leads the arm up to 90°, and exhale as it descends. This is a
healthy, comfortable breathing pattern, but if at first it is too
challenging, forget about it for the time being and return to it at
a later stage.
1. Full arm sequence – stepping
Despite the fact that you are standing up rather than on your
back, this practice can give you a very similar feeling to
swimming full-stroke backstroke. This practice should be
performed on dry land first and then in water.
• Stand looking straight ahead, feet apart, body rotated to the
left, with your left arm extended (1a). Elevate the right arm,
with the thumb leading, until it is level with the shoulder (1b).
• Release the left elbow and direct it away from the shoulder as
you turn the torso to the centre. Shift your weight to the left
leg and move up on to tiptoe with the right (1c).
• Turn the right palm out so that the little finger leads the up-
and-over action as the left arm presses against the water
(1d), and the body rotates to the right as the right leg steps
back (1e).
• Pause for the count of six and then repeat this complete
sequence of actions.
Remember Concentrate on flowing, continuous transitions,
stepping only as the arm comes up and over, i.e. maintain
primary control.
Avoid Do not move the arms simultaneously (windmilling), or
take overly large steps and lose your balance.

--- Page 119 Text ---
2. One complete cycle

--- Page 120 Text ---
2. One complete cycle
Perform only one complete sequence, to focus on coordinating
the arms, legs and torso.
• Step back and out with the left foot, extend the left arm (2a)
and lower yourself into a glide with the lead arm extended
and the right arm resting on your hip.
• Maintaining the length and direction of the left arm, raise the
right arm, leading with the thumb, until vertical.
• Release the elbow and wrist of the left arm (2b), whilst
maintaining the position and direction of the right.
• Press against the water with the left arm as the right arm
extends (2c) and the body rotates on to the side. The head
remains still.
Remember Flow from one movement to the next without
pausing; exit with the thumb and enter with the little finger.
Free the neck, allowing the head to be fully supported by the
water.
Avoid Do not hold your breath, try to push before you bend the
elbow, or windmill with the arms.
3. One cycle followed by six leg beats
This practice gives you the opportunity to focus on your balance
and direction and reinforces the lessons on the leg action
covered earlier.
The downside of this practice is that the lack of momentum
in the recovery, due to the pause in the arm cycle, can make
the recovery feel a bit heavy.
• Drift on to your back, with your arms by your sides. Without
altering the position of the head, rotate the body to the right
and extend the right arm forward under the water.
• Raise the left arm to 90°, maintaining the length and direction
of the right arm.
• Release the right wrist and elbow and move into the anchor

--- Page 121 Text ---
• Release the right wrist and elbow and move into the anchor
phase.
• Turn the left arm, and hold on to the water with the right arm
as you roll on to your left side and extend the left arm.
• Maintain this position for six leg beats before raising the right
arm and repeating the sequence with the left arm leading.
Remember Hold the water with the right arm and extend with
the left. Focus on the quality of the leg action and the head-
neck-back relationship when the arms are pausing during the
legs-only phase.
Avoid Do not move the arms simultaneously, hurry the arm or
leg action, allow the arms to enter too close to the head, or
cross the mid-line underwater.
4. Walk four, swim four
This practice combines the stepping practice you did at the
beginning of this lesson with four continuous strokes. By
combining walking with swimming, it establishes the rhythm
and pace of the stroke. Avoid the mistake of many of my pupils,
which is to noticeably increase their pace when they move from
the stepping part to the swimming part.
• Perform four complete steps, with the complete arm action, as
in the first practice of this section.
• After the fourth step, lower the body and drift off, ensuring
that the lead arm is fully extended and the head is centred.
• Perform four complete strokes, as in the previous practice,
without compromising the head-neck-back relationship.
Regain the feet.
• Stand at full height and move into the stepping sequence,
repeat both elements of this practice until the tempo of the
walking and swimming are the same.
Remember Flow from the stepping into the swimming, with
smooth, relaxed movements.

--- Page 122 Text ---
Avoid Do not move the arms simultaneously, or Increase the
tempo or level of effort in the swimming phases.
5. Integrating the legs with the arms
This practice is designed to help you match the rhythm of the
legs with the pace of the arms, and to counter the tendency to
over-kick or move the legs too rapidly. The rate can vary
between two, four and six leg beats per arm cycle.
• Lower yourself into the water and drift off with your head
supported by the water and both arms resting by your sides.
• When you feel stable, start the leg action. Keep the legs long
and direct them in an upward direction.
• Rotate the body to the side, slide the right arm under the
water, pause for a couple of seconds and then start the arm
action.
Remember The right arm and left leg extend simultaneously
and vice versa. In the extension phase, notice a diagonal line
running from the big toe to the thumb of the opposite hand.
Avoid Do not arch the back, lead with the knee or rush the leg
action.
6. Full stroke – continuous action
• After completing all the previous practices you are ready to
swim the full stroke. Instead of pausing the arm action at the
end of every cycle, continue in a flowing action. In backstroke
the face is permanently out of the water, which can give rise
to an irregular breathing pattern. A relaxed, well-balanced
stroke requires steady, consistent breathing. See the following
list of things to think about and avoid.
Remember The recovering arm leads the action. Hips and
shoulders roll around a constant axis: the spine. Maintain a still
head by freeing the neck.
Rotate the torso so that when the left arm enters the water

--- Page 123 Text ---
the right hip and shoulder are on top and vice versa.
In the underwater phase of the arm action, remember to
bend the arm and hold the water rather than performing a
windmill when the arms lose their grip on the water.
Light recoveries help you maintain a good body position and
easier breathing pattern. Allow inhalations to be passive and
soft.
Avoid Do not fix the neck and try to hold the head still. Do not
move both arms at the same time. Do not move the arms or
legs too quickly, or move the arm in the water too early and/or
drop it too deep.
If you are of average height, the hand should never be lower
than about 4 inches (10cm) below the surface.
One complete stroke
1. Extend one arm with the body rotated, neck free. The leg
action balances body.
2. Elevate the second arm, maintain the length of the lead arm
and rotate the torso to the centre.

arm moves towards the water leading with the little finger.

LEARN TO
CRAWL AGAIN

“The breakthrough in front crawl occurs the moment you realize
how little effort is required.’
Limor Shaw, co-founder of the Shaw Method

--- Page 126 Text ---
A forward-facing, overarm way of swimming has existed since
the earliest times. An ancient Egyptian mural (c.1200 BC) clearly
depicts soldiers in pursuit of their enemy using a crawl-like
swimming action. There is also evidence that the Greeks and
Romans swam in this way.
The term ‘front crawl’ was first coined in Australia in 1893,
when a swimming coach witnessed a young boy named Alick
Wickham speeding through the water using a stroke that he
had never seen before and exclaimed, “Look at that kid crawl.”
Alick had learnt the stroke from his older brother who, on a visit
to the Solomon Islands, had observed locals performing this
stroke.
This crude form of front crawl was developed and
popularized by two Australian brothers, Syd and Charles Cavill,
who took the stroke to Europe and the United States in 1902. It
is an interesting coincidence that F. M. Alexander took his
technique from Australia to England around the same time. The
superior speed of ‘Australian Crawl’, as it was dubbed, caused
something of a sensation. Although it has developed
significantly over the last century, the basic principle of
combining an alternate, overarm action with a vertical kick in a
prone position remains the same. Front crawl is a front-wheel
drive stroke, with the arms and upper body providing around 80
per cent of overall propulsion.
In many ways, it is the most intuitive of strokes: a newborn
baby will instinctively ‘doggy paddle’ in a form of underwater
front crawl. Swum skilfully, front crawl – with its continuous
arm action, streamlined body position and above-water arm
recovery – is not only the fastest but also the most energy-
efficient of strokes. For this reason, it is generally the stroke of
choice for those keen to swim quickly or cover a significant
distance. English Channel swimmers, as well as triathletes,
invariably choose front crawl. In freestyle competitions, any
stroke is allowed but due to its relative advantages over other
strokes, almost everyone chooses front crawl.

--- Page 127 Text ---
The easiest of strokes?
Front crawl, the most ergonomic of the four traditional strokes,
has many advantages and despite common misconceptions, it is
not difficult to learn. The frontal position allows the arms a full
range of movement. Coordinating the arms and legs is
relatively straightforward. The overarm recovery reduces drag,
in contrast to the underwater recovery of breaststroke.
As with the other strokes, front crawl can do more harm
than good without body awareness and good technique. It is
not the stroke you swim, but the way that you swim it
that counts.
Shaw Method key features
Alignment The body roll in front crawl is vital, with hips and
shoulders rotating around a central axis. The eyes look slightly
ahead when the face is immersed, and in the transition between
water and air, the head is directed forward while turning to
breathe.
Arm action Efficient crawlers spear the arm down into the
water, with the elbow and forearm following the hand, which
minimizes drag and maximizes stroke length. A bent elbow
directs forward prior to the propulsive movement, with the
emphasis on holding the water, not on pulling back. The arm
recovery is long and light, allowing the elbow to bend as a
result of gravity.
Leg action The pace of the leg action is steady and even, with
the emphasis on letting go before driving the leg forward,
keeping the ankles mobile throughout.
Timing The extended arm remains straight until your
recovering arm begins to enter the water. There are two leg
beats to every arm cycle unless you are sprinting.
Benefits
Front crawl has many health benefits. It strengthens the back,
tones the arms and legs, increases the mobility of the shoulders

--- Page 128 Text ---
tones the arms and legs, increases the mobility of the shoulders
and hips as well as improving cardiovascular fitness. There is
evidence that the alternating action of the left and right side of
the body balances the opposite hemispheres of the brain.
Risks and common errors
Alignment
1. Swimming the crawl with the head held high and lifting it to
breathe increases drag and strains the neck and back.
2. The traditional high elbow recovery in crawl puts undue
tension on the shoulders, which can lead to a form of tendonitis
(see glossary).
Timing
1. Most people automatically pull their extended arm back
whilst the recovering arm moves through the air (windmilling).
This does not produce an effective hold on the water.
2. Many waste a great deal of energy by moving the legs too
quickly. A slower, steadier rhythm is more appropriate if you
wish to swim for more than a couple of lengths.
Propulsion
1. Many people pull their arms straight back in the water, rather
than bending the elbow and flexing the wrist to achieve a more
effective anchor before applying propulsive force.
2. The common practice of actively kicking the legs out of the
water, employed by many swimmers, can strain and injure the
lower back.
LESSON 1: ORIENTATION AND LEGS
A birds-eye view of the Shaw Method front crawl, disregarding
the movement of the limbs, reveals that the torso rotates
rhythmically from the centre to the side and back again. These
changes in body position enable a swimmer to combine the
benefits of an effective purchase on the water with streamlining

--- Page 129 Text ---
changes in body position enable a swimmer to combine the
benefits of an effective purchase on the water with streamlining
in a way that promotes freedom of movement in the joints.
The objective of this lesson is to feel at ease in the various
positions and then to manoeuvre comfortably between them.
Here you will learn to employ the leg action and hip roll to
balance and achieve these transitions smoothly. Throughout the
horizontal practices in this lesson, including those where the
body rotates, the head remains still with the face immersed.
Leg action
The leg action of the front crawl aids buoyancy and balances
the arm action. Many front crawlers waste energy frantically
kicking their legs up and down. In the Shaw Method, the legs’
main function is to provide stability and rhythm, although they
do produce some forward momentum (around 20 per cent)
which assists the all-important body rotations.
The legs alternate: one actively presses downwards while the
other releases upwards. This action originates in the lower back
and moves through the hip, followed by a small bend of the
knee, which then straightens as the whole leg travels
downwards. The ankles remain free with the toes pointed
throughout; turning the legs slightly inward (in-toeing)
produces more even resistance.
Throughout the world, floats are commonly used for
practising the leg action. They are not, however, used in the
Shaw Method as they compromise alignment and can put
pressure on the neck and back. They also create an artificial
body position, which is very different from that of the full
stroke. It is preferable to direct the arms into the water and
work with your own level of buoyancy. Perform the leg action
practices in shallow water initially, so that you can stand up
comfortably each time you require a breath.
1. Glide
For all the strokes that involve putting the face in the water, we

--- Page 130 Text ---
always start with gliding (1a) and the leg press. Acclimatize to
the element of water, slow down, and work on your breathing
and head-neck-back relationship. For a complete description of
the forward glide, see Fun-da-mentals. Gliding is not only
beneficial at the beginning of each stroke session, it is also a
useful way of reconnecting to a sense of stillness and being able
to let go when working through intricate or challenging
practices.
2. Leg press
This standing practice gives you a good sense of how the
hip, knee and ankle joints all combine in an effective leg action.
Moving one leg at time, you can explore the sensation of
consciously releasing the leg and actively pressing it forward.

--- Page 131 Text ---
Like the equivalent practice in backstroke, the leg press
works on the relationship between alignment and the quality of
the leg action. It also highlights a couple of significant
differences in the range of motion: in front crawl the knee
bends less in the non-propulsive release and the whole leg
extends further forward in the propulsive movement.
• Stand tall on your left foot, place one hand on the side to
stabilize yourself and move up on to your tiptoes.
• Relax the right ankle, knee and hip, and release the leg
backwards, so that the upper thigh and foot are behind the
left leg (2a).
• Extend the right foot, straighten the leg without locking it and
swing the whole of the leg forward so that it is positioned in
front of the left (2b).
• The movement starts in the hip and finishes with the foot
pointing at an angle down and away from the body.
• Repeat this action six times before alternating legs.
Remember Stand tall throughout. On the back swing, maintain
the length of the leg and head-neck-back relationship. You

--- Page 132 Text ---
should feel minimal resistance on the backward action and
strong resistance on the forward action.
Avoid Do not arch the back when you release the leg
backwards. Do not move the leg too wide so that you lose your
balance, or move the head up or down or from side to side.
3. Front leg action
By translating your understanding from the previous practice
(of when to release and when to apply effort) to the horizontal
plane, discover how the legs generate forward momentum.
• Step forward as you extend both arms and smoothly drift into
a stable, balanced glide; breathe out gently.
• Release one leg upward and actively press the other
(lengthened) leg down into the water (3a).
• Notice how, as you actively press down with one leg, the
other rises passively.
• Perform 6–10 leg beats before regaining your feet.
Remember Release the lower back, hips, ankles and knees. In-
toe slightly on the forward action. Aim for a fluent, flowing
action.
Avoid Do make stiff, ‘wooden’ kicks, bend the legs too much or
bring the feet high out of the water. Do not push harder with
one leg than the other, actively blow out air, or hold your
breath.
4. The fencer
This practice gives you an experience of moving through water
with minimal resistance. It is a comfortable and secure
introduction to moving through the water on your side, and
connects the lead arm with the powerful muscles of the back.
• Stand with your right foot facing forward and the left turned
out, with the heels together at right angles and your weight
evenly spread. Keep your hands by your sides and look

--- Page 133 Text ---
evenly spread. Keep your hands by your sides and look
straight ahead (4a).
• Step forward with your right leg, extending the right arm with
the thumb uppermost, arm angled downward; leave the left
arm alone (4b).
• Draw your left leg towards the right, bringing the heels
together and the feet at right angles to each other. Release
the right arm to rest by your side.
• Centre your weight before stepping forward with the right leg
and extending the right arm again. Repeat four times before
leading with the left leg, noticing any differences.

--- Page 134 Text ---
Remember Maintain a steady rhythm, allowing the arm to
grow out from the back, and keeping the neck free and the
head centred.
Avoid Do not cross the mid-line with arms or legs, step outside
hip width, or move the head from side to side.
5. Side kick
In this practice on the side, although it is more challenging to
balance, you immediately experience how frontal resistance is
reduced, easing forward movement. It also provides an
opportunity to develop your balance on both sides. At first,
most right-handers tend to find it more comfortable to lead with
their right arm, and vice versa.
• Step forward with the left leg, extend the left arm and drift on
to your side, breathing out gently into the water (5a).
• The body balances on its side with head centred and eyes
looking down.

--- Page 135 Text ---
looking down.
• In this rotated position, start a slow, even leg action directing
the effort towards the right side for 6–10 leg beats.
• Roll back to the centre and regain your feet.
• Repeat the practice leading with the left arm, noting any
differences.
Remember When the right arm leads the movement, legs kick
to the left and vice versa.
Avoid Do not commence the leg action before you are balanced
on the side. Do not arch the lower back and/or over-rotate.
6. Centre to the side
Many people find it relatively straightforward to keep their head
still when they are on their side or in a flat position, but most
find it much more of a challenge when these two orientations
are combined. By focusing on the direction of travel you will
find it easier to keep the head centred.
• Glide with both arms extended, palms facing downward, and
hips parallel.
• Once you are stable on your front, begin the leg action,
performing it for six beats before pausing in preparation for
the transition (6a).

--- Page 136 Text ---
• Release the elbow and wrist of your left arm so that it is

--- OCR from Page 136 Image 2 ---
6c

--- Page 137 Text ---
• Release the elbow and wrist of your left arm so that it is
crooked (6b). Draw it towards the left hip; simultaneously
direct the right arm forward.
• As the right arm extends, spiral it forward and down into the
water. Turn the rest of the body from the hips to the left side.
The head remains centred with the eyes looking slightly
forward (6c).
• Perform the sideways leg action for six leg beats, centre the
body and regain the feet. Perform the sequence again, ending
up with left arm leading.
Remember Neck free and shoulders and hips roll around a
central axis. Feel as if you are swimming downhill.
Avoid Do not turn the head as you rotate, shorten the lead
arm, snatch the other arm back, or hold the breath.
7. Side – centre
This practice, the reverse of the previous one, gives clear and
immediate feedback on the way that the angle of the body
affects forward movement. The resistance of the water makes
the process of recovering the arm a little tricky; applying less
effort makes this movement easier. This same principle applies
in the full-stroke recovery, where many waste effort.
• Drift on to your side, with the left arm leading. Once stable,
start the leg action to the side and continue for six beats (7a).
• Pause the legs, release the wrist and elbow of the right arm
and sweep forward as if performing an underarm bowling
action, until it is parallel with the left arm, and the body is
gliding flat with both palms down (7b).
• When both arms are parallel, shoulder-width apart, and the
body is stable, restart the leg action for six beats before
regaining the feet (7c).
• Repeat the practice, this time starting with the right arm.
Remember Free the neck, particularly in the transition.

--- Page 138 Text ---
Maintain the direction of the lead arm as you move to the glide.
Avoid Do not apply excessive effort as you move the back arm
parallel with the front – it will push you back. Do not pull the
head back and raise your eye level.
8. Crawl rotation
Once you are comfortable making the transition from centre to
side, and side to centre, you can combine the two in a single
practice. Here the emphasis is on thinking forward and
maintaining a central head position as the body changes
orientation. Depending on your lung capacity, rotate after every
four or six leg beats. Fitter and more confident swimmers will
choose the latter.

--- Page 139 Text ---
LESSON 2: ARM ACTION
The overarm actions in the back and the front crawl share many
characteristics, the arms and upper body generating most of
the propulsion. In Shaw Method front crawl, the lead arm
maintains its length until the recovering arm begins to enter the
water. This aids stability and improves purchase. The emphasis
is on using the arms to hold the water, as if you were pulling
yourself along an imaginary rope rather than trying to pull
back. The torso effectively passes the anchored arm.
Do not be surprised if at first you find this new sequence
challenging, as it goes against a natural inclination to swing

--- Page 140 Text ---
challenging, as it goes against a natural inclination to swing
both arms at the same time. Spend time establishing this new
movement pattern on dry land before taking it into the water,
because when you swim the stimulus to revert to habit is
invariably stronger.
The arm action has five phases: extension, anchor,
propulsive, salute and handshake. This lesson teaches the
phases separately and then you link them together in a flowing
way. It is important not to think of the arms working in
isolation.
In this lesson, you will explore how head position, the
movement of the torso and the leg action all have a major
impact on the quality of the arm action. Similarly, the way you
hold your hands also has a significant impact. Many people are
accustomed to swimming the crawl with tense hands: they
often falsely believe that by stiffening them they will get more
purchase on the water. Experience shows that supple and open
hands are always more effective.
When learning to coordinate arm movements with the rest of
the body, it is vital that the head remains centred. Exhale
gently whenever the face is submerged; the more you exhale,
the lower your body tends to sink and the more effort is
required to propel yourself forward. Having a reserve of air in
your lungs not only helps you to remain relaxed and focused
but also increases your buoyancy.
The distinctive Shaw Method front crawl arm recovery
resembles the wings of an eagle, as opposed to the traditional
high elbow recovery commonly known as ‘chicken wings’. Our
eagle-like arm action is streamlined and powerful. Because it
does not involve hunching, it minimizes strain on the shoulder
joint.
1. Single-arm stepping
This practice can be performed in the pool or on dry land. Being
upright, you have a clear view of the arms in four of the five
phases, which makes coordination easier. Work on each phase
separately before linking them together in a flowing way. You
may find it helpful to perform the practice in front of a mirror.

--- Page 141 Text ---
may find it helpful to perform the practice in front of a mirror.
Extension – palm down
• Stand with your left foot pointing forward, right turned out,
heels together in an L-shape, body rotated to the right, arms
by the sides. The head is centered, looking ahead.
• Step forward with the left leg and simultaneously extend the
left arm with the palm down.
• The fingers are below the wrist, wrist below the elbow, elbow
below the shoulder. Both feet are firmly on the floor. Leave
the right arm resting by your thigh (1a).

the right arm resting by your thigh (1a).
Remember The arm grows out from the back, engaging the
muscles of the upper back.
Avoid Do not lock or hyper-extend the leading arm, lift the
shoulder, tense the back arm, or pull the head back.
Anchor
• Flex the wrist and elbow and rotate the forearm so that the
fingers are pointing down and the elbow is directed forwards.
• Lengthen from the shoulder to the elbow as you shift your
weight forward and rock up on to the straightening front leg,
allowing the heel of the back foot to lift (1b).
Remember Direct the elbow forward. Maintain balance by
keeping the lead foot grounded.
Avoid Do not hunch the shoulder as you bend the elbow or look
down at the floor.
Propulsive
Draw your left arm towards your left hip and step forward with
the right leg.
• Widen the back, rotate the arm and body to the left as the
arm passes the hip, and extend it behind you with the thumb
uppermost. The head is centred and the eyes continue to look
forward (1c).
Remember Keep the heel down. Make smooth transitions from
the right arm to the left.
Avoid Do not over-rotate the shoulder, narrow the back, tense
the arm or raise the back foot on tiptoe.
Salute
• Without pausing, continue the movement of the left arm up
and over and rotate the right hip back to the centre so that
the torso faces forward, relaxing the chest.
• As the hand reaches the highest point, release the elbow and

--- Page 143 Text ---
• As the hand reaches the highest point, release the elbow and
allow gravity to bring the hand down a few inches to the left
of the face, as if to salute, with the palm facing outwards
(1d).
Remember Your arm grows out from the collarbone. Keep a
sense of lightness as the arm flows through the air. Stand tall
throughout.
Avoid Do not pause in the transition between the third and
fourth phases, as this makes the arm heavier. Do not drop or
pull the head back.
Extend to handshake
• As you dynamically step with the left foot and rotate the body
without moving the head, spiral the left hand forward and
slightly down.
• The hand ends up with thumb on top, as if to shake
someone’s hand. The arm is fully extended, engaging the
upper back muscles in a slight downward trajectory (1e).
• Repeat this complete cycle four times before transferring to
the left arm.
Remember Keep the neck free and head centred throughout.
The hand remains relaxed and open.
Avoid Do not reach upward or arch the back as the arm
extends forward.
2. Standing start
This practice, with both arms in front, provides a stable base for
starting each action. In the early stages it is beneficial to use it
in both standing and swimming practices.
• Stand with the heels together in an L-shape, the right foot
facing forward and the left turned out. Keep both arms by
your sides.
• Step forward with the right leg, simultaneously extend the
right arm forward, and raise the left arm up and over into the

--- Page 144 Text ---
right arm forward, and raise the left arm up and over into the
salute phase (2a).
• Allow both arms to release down to the side and perform the
same sequence with the left arm leading, noting any
differences.
Remember Move forward and up. Both arms grow out of a
lengthening and widening back.
Avoid Do not drop the head, or hunch the shoulder by unduly
elevating the elbow.
3. Arms stepping
Standing upright, with your face out of the water, allows you to
firmly establish this newly coordinated arm action.
• Step forward with the right leg, lengthen and widen the back,

--- Page 145 Text ---
• Step forward with the right leg, lengthen and widen the back,
and move the arms into the standing start phase (3a).
• Flex the right wrist and elbow, gently press the hand and
forearm down on the water, and shift the weight forward and
up into the hook phase (3b).
• Step forward with the left leg, the left arm spiralling into the
handshake phase, the right arm releasing back and turning
out, with thumbs up. The right foot is turned outward and
your weight is evenly spread (3c).
• In a flowing action, let the right arm continue its movement
up and over. When it reaches its highest elevation, allow
gravity to help it bend into the salute phase; as it descends
rotate the left arm so that the palm is face down. Keep your
weight centred.
• Release the arms and start the practice again with the
opposite arm leading.
Remember As the arms move into the extension phase, keep
your heels on the floor. Thumbs leading the arm action.
Avoid Do not tense the shoulders or contract the upper back.
Insufficient hip rotation can strain the lower back. Do not drop
the lead arm.

--- Page 146 Text ---
4. One-cycle swimming
Having learned to coordinate the arm action on a vertical plane,
you are now ready to apply the action to swimming. The
emphasis should be on holding the water and focusing attention

--- Page 147 Text ---
emphasis should be on holding the water and focusing attention
on the direction of travel. Many people find it a challenge to
complete only a single sequence; do not give in to the
temptation to do more.
• Launch into a glide with both arms extended and angled
downward.
• Bend the right wrist and elbow to hook the water (4a).
• Achieve purchase on the water with the right arm as the left
extends forward into the handshake phase and the body
rotates on to its left side (4b).
• Maintain the length of the left arm as the right arm flows
straight up (4c) and over into the salute phase, and the body
and lead arm rotate back to a flat, centred position (4d).
• Extend into a glide and regain the feet. Then perform a single
sequence that starts on the other side.
Remember The recovery of the arm should be as light as
possible, with the neck free throughout.
Avoid Do not raise the head, lose the length of the lead arm or
break into a second stroke.
5. Walk four, swim four
Walking establishes rhythm and pace, which is carried over into
the stroke. It is important to count full strokes, i.e. at the point
when both arms are forward. If you count when the arm pulls
back it confuses the timing and can cause the lead arm to drop.
• Focus on the timing, paying attention to the beginning and
end of each cycle – one arm extended; the other in the salute
position.
• Establish a slow, steady rhythm for walking, followed by
similarly paced swimming strokes.
• Leave the face in the water when swimming, and breathe out
gently throughout. Excessive exhalation not only triggers
anxiety, it also causes the body to sink lower.

--- Page 148 Text ---
Remember Breathe out gently. More air is released in the
recovery phase, where the recovering arm bears down on the
breathing apparatus, than in the propulsive phase (where the
arm is below the chest).
Avoid Do not speed up the stroke rate when swimming. Do not
lose the timing, i.e. pull back too early. Do not breathe out
forcefully.
LESSON 3: BREATHING WITH EASE
In front crawl, inhalations are made through the mouth by
turning the head to the side.
Many people find it hard to understand why, when they were
younger, they were able to swim length after length of front
crawl, but in later life, after a short distance, they gasp for air.
In most cases this has more to do with incorrect positioning and
a lack of flexibility than fitness and stamina.
An effective breathing pattern results from having
understood and absorbed the essentials of the crawl covered in
the previous lessons – if these are not firmly in place, breathing
will invariably break down. By building on this foundation, in
this lesson you can see how body rotation and a swift turn of
the head combine to establish an effective breathing pattern.
The rotation provides more room, making the transition
between water and air easier. You can also draw on the
backstroke skills acquired earlier, as the hip and shoulder roll in
back crawl is similar to the breathing position in front crawl. The
following dry land practice graphically illustrates the significance
of the hip roll in breathing during the front crawl.
• Stand with one foot in front of the other, turn your head to
the right as far as is comfortable. Unless you are exceptionally
supple, you are likely to feel tension in the shoulder and a
lack of space (X).
• Turn your right hip outward so that the right foot is at 90°.
Rotate your head to the right, eyes looking slightly up –
notice how much further you can turn it and how much more

--- Page 149 Text ---
notice how much further you can turn it and how much more
comfortable it feels (Y).
We can directly relate this experience to swimming the front
crawl. The first position represents turning to breathe without
rotating the hip and shoulder, the second to breathing with the
body rotation. In the first position, a lack of space makes it
almost impossible to breathe without lifting the head and
shortening the neck, which inevitably causes the hips to sink
and also restricts the lungs. When the body is rotated to the
side, the crown stays submerged, the neck remains long, and
breathing is relatively straightforward.
To achieve an effective transition between the face being in
and out of the water, the turn of the head must be integrated
with the movement of the arms. In the previous section we
explored the importance of maintaining the length and direction
of the front arm until the second arm begins to enter the water,
in order to promote maximum propulsion. This timing is even
more significant for breathing. If the front arm pulls back before
the head and recovering arm have entered the water, not only
will you fail to gain an effective purchase on the water, but you

--- Page 150 Text ---
will you fail to gain an effective purchase on the water, but you
are also likely to sink and breathe in water.
Bilateral and unilateral breathing
Most people have a favoured side when it comes to breathing:
right-handed people usually feel more comfortable turning to
the left, and left-handed people find it easier to breathe to the
right. However, an efficient front crawl calls for bilateral
breathing, taking one breath every third or fifth arm recovery
(every 1.5 or 2.5 cycles, depending on lung capacity and fitness
level). Opting for unilateral breathing on the more comfortable
side is like doing flexibility exercises only on parts that are
flexible. Over time, unilateral breathing can have major postural
implications, leading to a lack of symmetry. Breathing on both
sides also gives a much better sense of flow and rhythm.
The practices in this section work towards bilateral
breathing. Initially it is advisable to spend more time on the
side you find most challenging. Following the rotational work
you did in previous lessons, you may discover that bilateral
breathing comes surprisingly easily.
1. Legs to the side
This position is not actually found in front crawl, but is very
beneficial for getting comfortable on your side and for
discovering how to position the head. It requires a little more
rotation towards your back than is necessary in the full stroke.
• Stand with your left foot forward and the right foot turned
outward. The head is in neutral, facing forward.
• Take a forward step with the left foot and turn the neck to
direct the gaze back and up to the right.
• Slowly descend on your left side until the shoulders are
submerged, with the arms resting by your sides. Gently drift
off with your face clear of the water (1a).
• Start the leg action: focus on releasing the back and pressing
the whole of each leg forward.

--- Page 151 Text ---
Remember Lead with your crown. Both ears are submerged
and both eyes out of the water. Release the lower back and
allow the legs to move freely from the hips.
Avoid Do not lift the head or one shoulder, sweep the legs too
widely or perform a cycling-type leg action.
2. Extending the arm and turning the head
This practice can be performed in the pool or on dry land. It
improves the range of motion of the neck and opens out the
sides of the body. It familiarizes you with this new alignment
and connects the arms with the back, which is essential for
producing a stable foundation from which to breathe.

--- Page 152 Text ---
• Stand tall, with your feet postioned in an L-shape – the right
one facing forward and the left one turned outward. Place
your arms by your sides and turn your head to look over your
right shoulder (2a).
• Extend the left arm directly upwards, as if you were reaching
for the sky, and release the right shoulder (2b).
Remember Release and lengthen the neck and allow the arm
to grow out from the back.
Avoid Do not arch the back, or fail to extend the arm fully,
allowing it to drift off to the side instead of being directed
straight up.
3. Lunge and breathe
This practice takes your upper body on to a horizontal plane
and prepares you to launch off into a comfortable breathing
position. It is useful to think of your lead arm being firm and
stable, and the upper arm being soft and loose.
• Step forward with the left foot, as the left arm extends
without lifting the hand higher than the elbow; leave the right

--- Page 153 Text ---
• Step forward with the left foot, as the left arm extends
without lifting the hand higher than the elbow; leave the right
arm alone (3a). Shift your gaze by turning the head a little
more to the right, to look slightly back and up.
• Perform six leg beats to maintain this position, then bring the
right leg forward to the left heel and stand up to full height.
Release the right arm so that it rests by your side.
• Perform the sequence again, this time leading with the left
leg.
Remember Turn the head smoothly as you lunge forward.
Keep the back open throughout.
Avoid Do not tense the shoulder of the lead arm or lift it
towards the ear. Do not look forward just before you lunge. Do
not take a large step forward.
4. Side step to breathe
This practice develops the ability to allow the arm to grow out
from the back and acclimatizes you to the feeling of moving
through water on your side without being able to see where you
are going.
• Start with your feet in an L-shape, hands by the sides, eyes

aa

--- Page 154 Text ---
• Start with your feet in an L-shape, hands by the sides, eyes
front (4a).
• Lunge with your left foot, extend the left arm at a downward
angle. As you step forward, turn the head so that the gaze is
directed back and up, and gently breathe in through the
mouth (4b).
• Maintain this position for a count of four. Step forward with
the right foot, releasing the right arm as you breathe out for a
count of six.
• Repeat this sequence six times and then perform it leading
with the right arm, noting any differences. Most left-handed
people find it easier to turn to the right, and vice versa.
Remember Breathe in as the arms open, and out as they
close. Direct the lead arm away.
Avoid Do not hold your breath or breathe in as the arms close.
Do not cross the mid-line, twist, or tense the neck.
5. Leg action – swimming on the side
This practice closely corresponds to the breathing position in
full-stroke front crawl. Apart from being an ideal way to work
on your leg action, as it does not compromise the head-neck-
back relationship, it is the best practice for learning to breathe
without shortening the neck.

--- Page 155 Text ---
• Start as in the previous practice. With your left arm leading,
step forward, lower yourself into the water and drift off
looking back and up (5a).
• Extend the left arm, angling it downward. Both ears should be
submerged, your chin should be just breaking the surface and
both eyes should be out of the water (5b).
• Alternately release the legs backward and press them
forward, directing them upwards without breaking the
surface.
• Continue for as long as is comfortable before repeating on the
other side.
Remember Allow the weight of the head to be supported by
the water. The lead arm is connected with the primary control,
which acts as a stable platform from which to balance. Keep the
back arm soft and loose, creating space to breathe.
Avoid Do not arch the back, lift the shoulders, widen the legs,
raise the lead arm or lift the head.
6: Rotate to breathe
Stand upright in the pool, looking ahead, with the arms poised

--- Page 156 Text ---
Stand upright in the pool, looking ahead, with the arms poised
to begin the stroke. Open out the arms as you launch yourself
on to your side and into the breathing position. This practice
allows you to practise the transition of the head from facing
forward to turning to the side, without the added complication
of having to put the face in and out of the water.
It is an ideal way of learning to coordinate arm action, body
rotation and head movement, so that you arrive at the
breathing point in a organized fashion. Dynamically rolling from
an upright stance to lying on your side emphasizes the
sensation of leading with the head, and feels like you are
performing a diving header, in soccer terms.

--- Page 157 Text ---
• Begin in the opening stance and then take a small step with
the right foot; both feet face forward.
• Extend the right arm and bring the left arm up and over into
the salute position. Keep your weight evenly spread and your
eyes looking ahead (6a).
• Without dropping your gaze, move up into the anchor phase,
bringing your weight forward and the back foot up on tiptoe
(6b).
• Exhale as you extend the left arm forward and allow the right
arm to move towards the right hip, while the head and body
dynamically rotate forward so that you are lying on your left
side with your face out of the water (6c).

--- Page 158 Text ---
side with your face out of the water (6c).
• Inhale gently and maintain this position for around ten
seconds by working the legs (6d). Repeat the whole sequence
four times before transferring to the other side.
Remember Lead with the head and leave the neck free in the
transitions. Concentrate on relaxed, gentle breathing through
the mouth.
Avoid Do not pull the head back as you roll forward. Do not let
the arm drift over the mid-line, or hunch the back shoulder.
7. Rolling out to breathe
You have done this practice with a dry face: now you are now
ready to progress to the transition between water and air. To
prevent water getting up your nose, make sure you exhale in
the transition between water and air.

--- Page 159 Text ---
• Drift off in the start position, with the right arm extended.
Exhale gently, and maintain this position by using the leg
action for a few seconds (7a).
• Flex the right wrist and elbow into the hook phase and direct
them forward breathing out gently into the water (7b).
• Spiral and extend the left arm forward and down as the right
arm holds the water, and the right hip and shoulder turn.
• Coordinate the head with the spiralling left arm so that it
turns out of the water, ending up with the mouth and nose
clear (7c).
• Breathe in gently through the mouth; use the legs to sustain
a comfortable body position on the side. Regain the feet and
repeat on the other side.
Remember Breathe out continuously in the transition between
water and air. Direct the lead arm forward and down to give

--- Page 160 Text ---
uplift.
Avoid Do not lift the head to breathe, turn the head after the
back arm has completed the stroke, or inhale through the nose
instead of the mouth.
8. Two strokes – roll out
By integrating the turn made to breathe with a couple of full
strokes, you get a clearer idea of the way your new breathing
pattern fits into the stroke. Maintaining the breathing position
at the end of the cycle will help you to inhale in a more relaxed
manner and avoid the common tendency to snatch the breath.
• Leading with the right arm, swim two complete arm cycles
with the face submerged. Look slightly ahead and start to
exhale gently.
• At the start of the third cycle, roll outward by gently turning
the head to the right, so the eyes, nose and mouth are clear
of the water but the ears remain submerged.
• Allow the air to enter gently through the mouth; maintain this
position by kicking on your side for six beats.
• Tuck up and regain your feet. After two complete stroke
cycles, perform the sequence leading with the left arm.
Remember Maintain the same rhythm on breathing and non-
breathing strokes. Focus on directing the lead arm forward
rather than on the pulling arm.
Avoid Do not actively take a breath, inhale through the nose,
or lift the head to inhale.
9. Returning the face
By working on the transition from the in-breath to the out-
breath in isolation, you can learn to prevent the common
mistake of dropping the lead arm before the head and
recovering arm have entered the water. By maintaining the
length of the lead arm, not only will you feel more control
coming into the water, but you will also be able to achieve

--- Page 161 Text ---
coming into the water, but you will also be able to achieve
effective purchase.
• Drift off on your side, with the right arm leading and head
turned left with the face out of the water. Maintain this
position for six leg beats (9a).
• Gently raise the left arm and turn the neck to bring the face
into the water as you rotate the right arm (palm down)
without dropping or shortening it (9b).
• Roll inwards until the hips and shoulders are almost parallel
and the body is flat (9c).
• Maintain this central position for six beats before regaining
your feet.
• Repeat the sequence on the other side.

--- Page 162 Text ---
• Repeat the sequence on the other side.
Remember The recovering arm should flow lightly through the
air into the water.
Avoid Do not bear down heavily with the recovering arm, or
drop the lead arm as the recovering arm is raised.
10. Full-stroke bilateral breathing
Swim a continuous, steady front crawl, breathing every third or
fifth stroke.
• Swing the recovering left arm; bend the right arm to hook
and direct the recovering left arm forward and vice versa.
• During strokes where the face is submerged, breathe out
gently when the arm holds the water, and a little more
actively in the recovering phase.
• It’s not necessary to rotate the body any further on the stroke
that takes the face out of the water, than on strokes where
the face remains submerged.
Remember Keep a steady, even rhythm to the movement of
the arms and legs. Hold the water with one arm and glide over
it with the other, always lengthening and widening the back.
Avoid Do not hurry the pace of the arms in order to breathe.
Do not gasp and lift the head to breathe, or drop the lead arm
after inhaling as you roll back.
One complete stroke
1. Centre the body with the eyes looking down, lead arm
extended with the palm down and second arm in salute.

--- Page 163 Text ---
2. Flex the wrist of the lead arm and direct the elbow forward to
anchor the water.
3. Direct the saluting arm forward to the handshake as the
body dynamically rotates onto the side.
4. Direct the new lead arm forward as the recovering arm
lengthens through the air, thumb leading, body centered.

Breaststroke to butterfly
Butterfly, the newest of the four traditional swimming styles,
evolved from breaststroke. It was developed in the 1930s by
US swimming coaches who were keen to make breaststroke
faster. They found it frustrating that even though breaststroke
generated a great deal of propulsive force, much of this was
wasted during the underwater recovery phases. They made two
major modifications: recovering the arms by moving them over
the top, and experimenting with a dolphin-like leg action. This
new version of the stroke was swum alongside classical
breaststroke until the 1950s, when butterfly was finally
designated a distinct stroke. Since then, butterfly has gone
from strength to strength and is now the second quickest
stroke.
Four-wheeled fly
In many ways, butterfly is the supreme stroke: a four-wheel
drive stroke with equal propulsion coming from the upper and
lower body, and where swimmer and water merge. Seen as the
preserve of the strongest and fittest, swimming continuous
butterfly seems completely out of reach to most people. Even
amongst the most advanced fitness swimmers it is rare for
anyone to be able to swim more than 200 metres (650ft)
without feeling exhausted.
In this section you will discover that the butterfly is not
necessarily more challenging than other strokes. As always in
the Shaw Method, the key is to work intelligently with the
water. Butterfly is an ideal opportunity to put your new
relationship with the water to the test. Without releasing
tension and working with buoyancy you will struggle to
progress.
The following lessons take you through a series of practices
covering the core elements of the butterfly undulation, arm and
leg actions, and integration of the breath. As in all strokes, only

--- Page 166 Text ---
covering the core elements of the butterfly undulation, arm and
leg actions, and integration of the breath. As in all strokes, only
attempt the full stroke when you have consolidated the
preliminary practices.
Shaw Method key features
Orientation Unlike conventional butterfly, where a powerful,
dolphin-like leg kick is key to undulation, the head is key in the
Shaw Method. The crown leads the body forward and down,
with the eyes leading the body forward and up.
Arm action The arm recovery is low and wide, and connected
to the movement of the hips and back. The slower, lighter arm
recovery leading into a glide makes for a significantly more
sustainable stroke. Beneath the surface, the focus is on holding
the water to press the torso forward rather than pulling it back.
Leg action The two-beat, dolphin-like leg action is gentle and
flowing, with the emphasis on pressing the legs down and
allowing them to float up. This lighter action is less tiring and
makes it easier to recover the arms.
Rhythm The hallmark of the Shaw Method butterfly is its
steady, even rhythm and a strong sense of gliding through the
water with the emphasis on allowing the water to lift the body.
Benefits
The continuous, wavelike action in butterfly is both energizing
and calming. It mobilizes the spine, benefiting those with a stiff
or tense back. People suffering from sciatica and other lower
back conditions have experienced relief from learning the Shaw
way to do butterfly. This benefit is in part the result of the
strengthening effect that the undulating action has on the
abdominals. The stroke helps to tone the arms and legs, and
the wide overarm recovery broadens the back.
Risks and common mistakes
Alignment

--- Page 167 Text ---
Alignment
1. Many people struggle to recover their arms, which often
leads them to apply more effort, compounding the problem. The
solution is to engage the hips and lower back; when the arms
move backwards the hips sway forward and vice versa.
2. Many find it difficult to release the hips, making the arm and
leg actions more difficult.
3. If you lift the head too high to breathe, it will cause the hips
to sink too low. Keeping the head out of the water for too long
impedes arm recovery, straining the neck and upper back.
Timing
1. Many have difficulty with coordination, attempting to push
their hips and arms forward simultaneously.
2. If you breathe on every stroke it requires more effort and
can lead to hyperventilation. Breathing on every second stroke
is more efficient, providing more time to breathe out.
3. Many struggle to achieve the recommended cycle of two leg
beats. In Shaw butterfly, we focus on the first leg beat and, by
gliding at the end of the recovery, allow the second to occur
naturally as a consequence of the undulation of the torso.
Propulsion
1. Many people overestimate the amount of effort required.
Kicking too hard is not only tiring, but interrupts the flowing
action of the arms. With the dolphin-like leg action it is
important to press the legs down and allow them to float back
up.
2. Another common stroke fault is to pull the arms straight
back, rather than holding the water to propel the body forward.
A higher, elbow-hooking action under the water improves
purchase.
3. Many experience a build-up of tension in the arms and
shoulders as a result of applying undue effort under the water.
This can be addressed by releasing the arms as they approach
the hips.

--- Page 168 Text ---
LESSON 1: UNDULATION
The overall impression of someone swimming the butterfly with
style is a continuous, wavelike motion of the whole body. The
movement of the arms and legs fades into the background as
one witnesses this graceful action. In most swimming manuals,
undulation is seen as a consequence of the dolphin-like leg
action and the recovery of the arms. In the Shaw Method, the
undulation is at the heart of the stroke, with the movement of
the trunk making a significant contribution to overall propulsion,
providing the foundation for both the arm and leg actions.
Dolphin action
The legs remain together throughout and the movement flows
through the hips, resembling a dolphin swimming along. Gliding
with the knees released, a Shaw Method butterfly swimmer
presses down with the upper body as the hips rise, then presses

--- Page 169 Text ---
presses down with the upper body as the hips rise, then presses
down with the legs, causing the upper body to be pushed to the
surface.
This first lesson takes you though a series of practices in
order to develop an effective dolphin action and master the art
of undulation. A significant proportion of the overall propulsion
is generated by the combined actions of the legs and the torso.
It is important to be patient, as the wavelike motion is probably
unlike anything you have done before. It may take a while
before you can perform it with ease.
1. Body balance
The gliding phase of this practice develops your ability to
balance without the support of the arms. This is an important
skill in butterfly, the only stroke where both arms are
simultaneously brought behind the body. Learning to regain the
feet without the assistance of the arms develops your control of
the core muscles, which is crucial to undulation.
• Inhale gently and step forward, arms by the sides. Bow
forwards and start to exhale gently into the water.
• Without actively pushing, drift off into a glide with the eyes
looking down and a sense of the crown leading the movement
(1a).
• Maintain this stable position, without moving the limbs or
trunk, for the count of four. Then press the head down (1b)
and tuck up to regain the feet without using the arms (1c).
• Repeat the above sequence leading off with the other leg.
Remember Keep the neck free, and the shoulders and arms
relaxed throughout.
Avoid Do not actively push off from the floor or pull the head
back to regain the feet.
2. Upright wave
This practice familiarizes you with moving the torso as one unit.
It can been performed either floating upright in deep water or

--- Page 170 Text ---
It can been performed either floating upright in deep water or
standing. The movement is assisted by the uplift of the water
and the resistance offers useful feedback.
• Either take up the opening stance or tread water (see
glossary).
• With palms facing to rear, tilt the upper body forward from
the hips (2a), bend the knees slightly and if standing keep the
heels in contact with the floor.
• The hips move forward and the upper back sways backwards
as the arms gently sweep behind the body. If standing, move
up on to tiptoes with eyes at eye level (2b).
• Repeat a number of times until the movement of arms and
back feel integrated.
Remember Move the body as one complete unit. Release the
hips and relax the shoulders.
Avoid Do not arch the back or pull vigorously with the arms.

--- Page 171 Text ---
3. Wave – arms extended
This movement corresponds to the start of every stroke in
butterfly. In this practice it is important to resist the temptation
to pull the body down with the arms.
• Step forward. As the arms extend, bow the head and drift into
a glide, eyes front, breathing out gently (3a).
• With your arms extended, press the chest down to allow the
hips to rise, the crown of the head leading the body forward
and slightly down. Ankles and knees loose (3b).
• Allow the legs to press down and the body to float up as you
look ahead again. Look down to glide forward for a few
seconds (3c) before regaining your feet.
• Move from a single wave into a series of waves. If you have

--- Page 172 Text ---
• Move from a single wave into a series of waves. If you have
difficulty doing more than one, press the chest forward as the
body rises.
Remember Move the body as a whole. The downward
movement is active and the upward passive. Direct the
undulating movement with your fingertips.
Avoid Do not stiffen the hips, over-bend the knees and lift the
feet clear out of the water, pull the head back or hold your
breath.
4. Wave – arms trailing
Both this and the previous practice give you the sensation of
working the torso as one unit. Some find this practice easier;
others find it harder. It is easier to be aware of the nodding
action of the head in the undulation without the arms.
• Inhale gently, step forward with arms by the sides. Bow
forwards, eyes looking ahead, and start to exhale gently (4a).
• Collapse the chest and actively press down, releasing the
lower back so that the hips are driven upward as the legs

--- Page 173 Text ---
• Collapse the chest and actively press down, releasing the
lower back so that the hips are driven upward as the legs
extend (4b).
• Allow the upthrust of the water to lift the upper body as the
knees bend and the hips move forward and down (4c). Regain
your feet. Now attempt to link a series of undulations
together.
Remember Keep hands loose by your sides. Allow legs to
lengthen and float up with the rest of the body. Enjoy the ebb
and flow of this movement.
Avoid Do not arch the back unduly, poke the chin forward,
over-bend the knees, lift the feet out of the water, or dive too
deep.
LESSON 2: ARM ACTION
As discussed earlier, the arm action in butterfly is a
consequence of the undulating movement of the torso. When
the hips move forward and down, the arms sweep backwards
(in the direction of the hips) and when the hips and back move
backwards, the arms recover over the surface of the water. The

--- Page 174 Text ---
backwards, the arms recover over the surface of the water. The
symmetrical double arm action in butterfly can be broken down
into four phases:
Extension The arms are directed forward and angled slightly
down just within the width of the shoulders.
Lever The wrists are flexed and elbows bent.
Propulsive The holding phase, where the forearms actively pull
the torso forward.
Recovery Both arms coast widely over the surface and
lengthen into the extension phase.
The release into the recovery phase starts when both arms are
still in the water; it is important not to pull too far backwards as
this will tend to lock the arms. The recovery phase is often
perceived as the most challenging, and many people waste
unnecessary mental and physical effort trying to lift their arms
over the water. This lesson teaches that when the other phases
are working correctly, the recovery effectively happens by itself.
1. Spreading your wings
This action gives you a sense of how the movement of the back
and pelvis promote an open and wide recovery action.
• Stand with your feet together, hips forward, knees slightly
bent, and head gently tilted back so that the eyes look slightly
up (1a).
• Open the shoulders and sweep the extended arms out to the
side to just behind the hips, palms facing forward (1b). This
promotes a sense of opening across the chest.
• Step forward with the left foot and start to exhale as you
simultaneously sweep your arms over the surface of the water
(1b). Lengthen the back of the neck so the eyes are looking
straight down. Whether or not your face ends up submerged
depends on the depth of the pool (1c).

--- Page 175 Text ---
Remember Keep most of your weight on the back foot as you
step forward. Broaden the back across the shoulders as the
arms sweep over the surface.
Avoid Do not narrow the back when the arms are in their initial
position behind the hips. Do not allow the arms to become out
of sync. Stifle the tendency to lead with the dominant arm.

--- Page 176 Text ---
2. Stepping and sliding the arms
This practice can be performed in the water or on dry land, and
helps you appreciate how the arms and hips combine to
produce forward momentum. On dry land, the arm recovery is
very straightforward. With the resistance of water, it is more of
a challenge, which further highlights the importance of a gentle
recovery.
• Bend the knees and allow your torso to incline forward as you
lengthen along the spine (2a). Leading with the wrists, slide
the arms forward until they are fully extended and direct your

--- Page 177 Text ---
the arms forward until they are fully extended and direct your
gaze towards the floor.
• Flex the hands and release the elbows as you prepare the
forearms as if to take hold of the water, with weight evenly
distributed on both feet.
• Push the hips forward and gently bend the back (2b) as you
take two small steps forward (2c).
• In one continuous action, incline the torso and extend the
arms forward (2d). Repeat the whole sequence five or six
times.
Remember The arms act as levers to draw the torso forward,
actively pressing the air out as the torso inclines forward.
Inhale as the hips thrust forward and arms move back.
Avoid Do not move the arms without changing the position of
the hips. Do not over-arch, or hyper-extend the spine.
3. Soaring
This practice involves pressing the body down and pulling it
back up with the arms. This is one of the most important of the
butterfly practices, as it establishes the overall rhythm of the
stroke and highlights the relationship between the dolphin-like
leg action and the underwater phase of the arms.
• Launch off into a glide with your arms extended, knees
slightly bent and eyes looking in the direction of travel;
breathe but gently into the water.
• Nod your head as you actively straighten the legs and press
the body downward whilst maintaining the length and
direction of both arms (3a).
• Look ahead, gently tilting the head backwards, and as the
body starts to float up, open the arms, flex the hands and
bend the elbows (3b).

--- Page 178 Text ---
• Hold on to the water and allow the head to lead the body
forward and up to the surface (3c). Do not be concerned if
this brings your face out of the water.
• Remain with your arms by your side, eyes looking ahead and
knees bent, until you stop moving forward, at which point
tuck to regain the feet with your arms by your sides.
Remember Flex the hands and bend the elbows. Release the
arms towards the waist as you press the hips toward the floor.

--- Page 179 Text ---
Avoid Do not go too deep by using the arms to pull you down
rather than to assist elevation.
4. Wave revisited
This revision practice reconnects you to the undulation which is
at the heart of the stroke. This combination of the extended and
trailing arm undulations serves as a timely reminder not to
overwork the arms. It also gives an opportunity to experiment
with applying a major and minor dolphin action.
• Exhaling gently, glide with the arms extended, knees bent and
eyes looking slightly ahead. Actively press down with the head
to hollow the chest and release the lower back so that the
hips are driven upward. Thrust with the legs as they extend
allowing the head and fingertips to lead your upper body
down.
• Look up and direct the chest and arms forward as the upper
body travels towards the surface.
• As the body starts to float up open the arms, flex the hands
and bend the elbows. Gently tilt the head backwards. Hold
onto the water and move forward with the chest as you press
the body up towards the surface.
• Instead of pausing as in the previous practice, undulate again
but with the arms trailing by the sides. As with the arms
extended, perform a second lighter and smaller undulation
before regaining the feet.

--- Page 180 Text ---
5. Breastafly
This practice helps counter the common mistake of
overemphasizing the action of lifting the arms clear of the water
while not paying attention to what happens below. Because this
form of recovery creates resistance, it encourages the pattern
of making a soft recovery, which is important in the full stroke –
a positive side effect of the practice.
• Inhale gently and launch smoothly into a glide, with both
arms extended, the head slightly tilted back, eyes looking
ahead.
• With the arms still extended, bow the head to push the upper
body down towards the floor (5a).
• Flex the wrists and bend the elbows to take hold of the water
(5b), and thrust the hips and chest forward as you propel
yourself towards the surface.
• Draw the hands together in front of chest with the eyes
looking down (5c).
• Slide the arms forward as if you were performing a
breaststroke arm recovery.

--- Page 181 Text ---
breaststroke arm recovery.
• Repeat the whole sequence a second time and regain the feet.
Remember Accelerate forward and down with the lower body
and then forward and up with the upper body, using the
recovery to balance.
Avoid Do not lift the arms out of the water. Do not exhale
forcefully as this will make you sink.
6. Arm action with feet on the ground
Standing stationary, follow the same sequence of arm and body
movements as in the second practice, but instead of performing
an underarm recovery, bring the arms over the top as the hips
sway back. Being upright, with the face permanently clear of
the water, it is easier to learn the rhythm of the stroke as you
can continue the movement many times without needing to
stop for a breath.
• Extend the arms forward, leading with the wrists, and allow
the hips to release back as the upper body sways forward.
Keep the legs bent with the heels on the floor (6a).
• Draw the arms back as the hips incline forward and the
weight shifts on to the balls of the feet, knees slightly bent
(6b).
• In one continuous movement, leading with the tips of the little
fingers, start to swing the arms (6c) up and over the top (6d).
Remember The overarm recovery is a consequence of the
movement of the hips and arms beneath the surface.
Avoid Do not push at any point during the cycle, particularly
when the arms are behind you, as it makes the arms feel
heavier in the recovery.

--- Page 182 Text ---
7. Complete arm action
After practising all the individual elements of the stroke, you
are now ready to put it all together. A pause at the end of the
cycle gives you the opportunity to discover the second dolphin
beat, which often gets left out in continuous butterfly
swimming.
• From a glide, perform one full stroke with the face in the
water and an overarm recovery (7a–d).
• At the end of the cycle, maintain the length of the arms and
relax. You will notice a second small wave through the body.
This second wave is a consequence of the arm recovery and
should be allowed to happen by itself rather than actively

--- Page 183 Text ---
should be allowed to happen by itself rather than actively
creating it.
• Glide for three or four seconds, then undulate without
shortening the arms and regain the feet.
Remember Release the pressure in the arms when they pass
the thigh.
Avoid Do not pull the arms beyond the hips or rush the arms
forward in the recovery.
8. Two complete strokes
Now you have integrated the torso, arms and legs with face
submerged for one stroke, you can progress to performing this
action a couple of times. Swimming with the face in the water
helps establish flow and rhythm without the pressure of having
to breathe.

--- Page 185 Text ---
LESSON 3: INTEGRATING THE BREATH
Issues concerning breathing are a major cause of anxiety for
those wishing to master butterfly, and three of the most serious
stroke faults are rooted in a lack of confidence.
Struggling to get the face out of the water to breathe leads
many people to lift their heads too high, which not only wastes
energy but also creates excessive drag as the lower body is
forced down. This also leads to the tendency, discussed in the
other strokes, to actively inhale, which can give rise to
hyperventilation. Unease about breathing also causes swimmers
to keep their faces out of the water for too long. Pulling the
head back during the recovery of the arms makes this action
more of an effort and strains the neck.
Breathing with ease
In butterfly, as with the other strokes, explosive breathing is

--- Page 186 Text ---
In butterfly, as with the other strokes, explosive breathing is
detrimental. However, the intense and explosive way in which
most people approach the stroke means that forceful
exhalations are unavoidable.
This can be countered by slowing down and relaxing. You will
feel less desperate to take a breath and consequently able to
negotiate the transition between water and air more fluently.
Efficient breathing entails allowing the head to lift gently rather
than snatching it out of the water, which is a sure way to give
yourself a whiplash injury! The head moves wiith each
undulation, and all that is necessary for the face to break the
surface is to continue this movement a little further.
Until recently, swimming coaches generally required
swimmers to breathe every other stroke. It was believed that
even a slight lift of the head reduced streamlining and speed,
but then came Michael Phelps, butterfly world record holder and
Olympic champion, who breathes on every stroke. Experiment
with different breathing patterns and find out what works best
for you. Whatever you choose, always exhale at the end of the
recovery; to do it any earlier will put your head out of sync with
the undulating action of the rest of the body.
In an attempt to reduce resistance, some butterfly swimmers
have even started turning their head to the side to keep it as
low as possible. I find this way of breathing problematic, as
when my head turns I feel that the rest of my body wants to
follow. But feel free to try it out for yourself: my reluctance may
be the result of habitual patterns carried over from the front
crawl.
1. Breathing – feet on the ground
Practise coordinating your breathing with the arm action in
shallow water.
• Stand with your feet together, arms extended and eyes
looking straight ahead.
• Exhale as you press the hips forward and draw the arms to
your sides, allowing the knees to bend. Notice how, at the end

--- Page 187 Text ---
your sides, allowing the knees to bend. Notice how, at the end
of this pull phase, you spontaneously feel like inhaling (1a).
• Resume the exhalation as the arms swing over, leading with
the little finger (1b).
• Continue the practice for six cycles; pause.
Remember Sway the hips and allow the exhalation to follow
the recovery phase naturally.
Avoid Do not breathe in reverse, i.e. inhale on the recovery
and exhale at the end of the pull phase.
2. Breathing for butterfly on land
Now practise coordinating your breathing with the arm action
on dry land.
Although you are standing, the fact that in this practice you
move forward as the arms perform their propulsive phase gives
you a good sense of the stroke’s rhythm and further integrates
the timing of breathing learned in the previous practice.
• Perform the same sequence of movements as in the previous
practice, but instead of keeping the feet still, step forward in

--- Page 188 Text ---
practice, but instead of keeping the feet still, step forward in
dynamic holding phase.
• As the arms recover over the surface, keep the feet still.
Remember The torso is propelled forward and the arms flow
lightly through the air.
Avoid Do not over-arch the back or keep it too straight. Do not
tense the arms.
3. Two complete strokes, breathing on the second one
Combine poise, power, ease and fluidity.

--- Page 189 Text ---
• Glide with relaxed arms extended to a width that is a little
narrower than shoulder width.
• Undulate forward and down, release the legs so that they are
slightly bent and then actively press them down to start the
elevation of the body towards the surface.
• Use the arms to pull the body towards the surface, allowing
the eyes to look ahead but without bringing them out of the
water.
• Release the arms as they pass your thighs; at this point begin
to press the chest forward and release the hips so that the
arms can flow through the air easily. The arms enter the
water rotated slightly outwards.

cle

water rotated slightly outwards.
• Glide until you feel a second smaller undulation pass through
you.
• Repeat the same sequence as for the first movement, raising
the eye level more during the arms’ propulsive phase so that
the mouth breaks the surface (3a) and you inhale gently.
• Bring the face swiftly back into the water and start to exhale
(3b) as the arms recover over the surface (3c).
Remember The first stronger leg beat occurs when the arms
are extended, the second during the recovery.
Avoid Do not apply too much force with the legs, creating a big
splash.
One complete stroke
1. Start with arms forward, eyes looking slightly forward and
knees released.
2. Press the head down. Hips move up as the legs extend, eyes
down.
3. Raise the head, bring the eyes up, flex the wrist and bend

4. With eyes leading hold the water, press the chest and hips
forward, hands relaxed.

FINAL WORD
I suggested earlier that fitness objectives need to be put to one
side until you can move well in the water. The tendency to drift
back to old habits is greatest when swimming the full stroke, so
continue working with the Shaw Method practices. They will
keep you mindful of the core features of each stroke and many
of them, as well as promoting good form, can be incorporated
into your exercise routine. For example, the front crawl practice
where the body rotates and the arms perform an underwater
recovery can be developed into a good cardiovascular workout
by turning the head to breathe.
As each stroke has its own essential character and rhythm it
is beneficial to swim a variety. However, avoid chopping and
changing too often as it takes time settle into each stroke. I,
personally, find it takes me at least ten minutes to get
accustomed to a stroke’s subtleties before I am ready to move
on. One of the best ways to assimilate this work is to share
your experience with others. For example, if you are struggling
to co-ordinate the arms and legs in breaststroke, it is useful to
offer to teach someone else an aspect of the stroke that you
have already grasped. Apart from boosting morale this will
deepen your own understanding.
Many are enticed by the prospect of swimming freely in a
natural environment, for others this has long been an
unattainable dream. Whatever your starting point, having
invested time and effort mastering the art of swimming, the
allure of open water is likely to be very strong. By all means
pursue this ambition and enjoy the sense of freedom that it
brings but get to know the new environment and take care.
Simon Murie of SwimTrek, a channel swimmer and seasoned
open water guide, never swims more than 100 meters out to
sea unaccompanied. Others may be drawn to training for some
form of competition such as master swimming or triathlon. This
is a great way to reap the rewards of your mindful practice and
meet other swimming enthusiasts. Remember to pay attention

--- Page 193 Text ---
meet other swimming enthusiasts. Remember to pay attention
to good form and do not get too distracted by results.
Shaw Method essentials
Below is a useful summary of the principles underpinning the
Shaw Method learning process.
• The maintenance of a balanced head-neck-back (HNB)
relationship is key. Whatever is happening with the rest of
your body is secondary. The HNB affects your swimming
performance more than anything else, particularly when it
comes to the transition between water and air.
• Remember that before every propulsive movement there is a
vital non-propulsive action. Undue effort in the non-propulsive
phase undermines the ability to achieve an effective purchase
on the water.
• Give attention to directing yourself forward rather than pulling
backwards. This can also be a metaphor for the rest of your
life.
• Efficient swimming is more about learning to let go than it is
about doing more. Be patient with yourself and remember
that trying to get it right is often the biggest impediment to
the learning process. Be gentle with yourself as changing your
relationship with water can stir up powerful emotions.
• Always co-ordinate breathing with the stroke. Breath-holding
is not recommended!
• Your swimming will develop better when backed up by work
out of the water. Dry land practices are a remarkably effective
way of establishing new patterns of movement.
• Think in terms of phases rather than positions. In order to
learn the strokes it has been necessary to break the
movements down into their essential parts. When swimming
continuously, flow rhythmically from one phase to the next.
• Cultivate a mindful approach and learn to interact artistically
with the water. Stop working against the water and start
swimming with it.

--- Page 194 Text ---
swimming with it.
• Don’t judge your performance by others’ standards.
Remember swimming is an adventure into the unknown, not a
struggle to get things right.
• Finally, remember to be creative, have fun and explore the
water. Don’t be dogmatic, there is more than one way to
cross a river. My own swimming and the Method continue to
evolve.
Equipment
Swimming is accessible to all and does not require much
equipment. It is worth splashing out on a decent costume and a
good pair of goggles. Avoid suits that trap air or water and for
woman make sure there is ample space for the arms to move
freely. From the wide range of swimming eyewear available I
find Aqua Sphere offer great panoramic vision and are easy to
adjust. In the early stages of learning the Shaw Method it is
necessary to work at a measured pace which in cooler water
can lead to physical and mental tension. Light non-buoyant
thermal tops, available at dive shops, are great for maintaining
a comfortable temperature.

GLOSSARY
Bilateral breathing Breathing on both sides in front crawl as
opposed to unilateral breathing, which is on just one side. In
terms of good use, a bilateral pattern is clearly preferable as it
promotes symmetry.
Breaststroker’s knee Most knee injuries are related to the use
of the whip kick. ‘Breaststroker’s knee’ is the result of repetitive
stress to the Medial Collateral Ligament.
Drag This impedes motion; the level of drag is determined by
the degree of resistance created by an object’s size, shape or
orientation. This is one of the reasons why a bus moves more
slowly than a sports car and why the rotated orientation in
crawl is more streamlined than the flatter positioning of
breaststroke.
Explosive breathing A common practice in competitive
swimming where breath is held and then blown out forcefully
just prior to inhalation.
Holding the water The idea of using the arms as levers to
transport the torso forward rather than the common tendency
of pulling back. Front arm crawl action is similar to pulling along
a rope.
Hyperventilation Unusually deep or rapid breathing often
caused by anxiety or habit, leading to a feeling of
breathlessness and sometimes faintness.
Screw Kick An uneven breaststroke leg action in which one
foot is turned in and the other turned out throwing one side of
the pelvis forward with each kick; it strains the sacro-iliac joint
and is potentially injurious.
Sculling A motion employing rotational hand movements often
in a figure of eight, which can be performed on the back, front
or vertically. It helps develops a ‘feel for the water’ important to
all strokes.
Swimmer’s shoulder (tendonitis) An injury that develops
through misuse of the shoulder joint (rotator cuff) resulting in
inflammation and pain. The body rotation and relaxed recovery

--- Page 197 Text ---
employed in Shaw Method crawl reduce the incidence of this.
Treading water A skill requiring a combination of limb
movements in order to remain upright in the water without
submersing the face. There are various ways of treading water
with good alignment which do not require much effort.
Trickle breathing Gradual exhalation with the face in the
water.
Tumble turn A spin and underwater push off from the wall
used in back and front crawl, incorporating a half forward
somersault and twist. Tumble turns allow you to swim laps
continuously without losing rhythm.
Undulation A wave-like action of the body employed in
breaststroke and butterfly.

Dedication
Dedicated to the memory of my great teacher Zeev Tadmore who gave me the
confidence to truly explore my relationship with the water from an Alexander
Technique perspective.
Acknowledgments
I wish to thank my parents Helen and Maurice Shaw for their encouragement and
unwavering support. The material in this book is the result of work over the years
and I am indebted to all of my colleagues, students and pupils for helping me turn
my passion into a career. Particular credit goes to Charlotte Parry-Crooke, Malcolm
Balk, Philip Tibenham and Armand D’Angour.

Balk, Philip Tibenham and Armand D’Angour.
I wish to thank Limor Shaw who is currently developing the work in Israel, for her
deep understanding and long-term commitment to the Shaw Method. To my friend
and colleague Gillian Jordan for making it possible to train others to teach this
Method and for her help and suggestions with the text.
I would like to thank Zillah Crosby, my life partner, for backing me up on every stage
of this project. Without her insightful contributions and attention to detail this book
would have been infinitely inferior.
I would like to acknowledge the many people who directly contributed to the creation
of this book. To Graham, Yulia Parker, David Tozer together with Zillah Crosby and
John Paul for the excellent photography. Thanks to Joanne Makin for her skilful
illustrations. Thanks also to the models Jennifer Evans, Vicky Harmer, Deborah and
Helen Stevens and Huseyin Dermis who skilfully embody the Shaw Method. To
Margaret and Tony Farrell for their kindness and patience in allowing us to use their
pool in Esher. Finally thanks to Jonathon Drake and Andrew Crosby for their
assistance and suggestions with the manuscript.
