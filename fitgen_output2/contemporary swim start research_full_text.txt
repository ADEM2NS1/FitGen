Chapter 1:
how important iS the Underwater phaSe to elite
Swimming Start performanCe?
Elaine Tor, Victoria University, Australia
Introduction
The swimming dive start is a complex movement involving the reaction to a
stimulus; the coordination of explosive movements of the arms, trunk, and
legs to propel the body forward with maximum velocity; and the ability to
maintain a streamlined position to minimize the loss of horizontal velocity
in the water (Guimaraes & Hay, 1985). The international rules of swimming
dictate that swimmers must resurface from the underwater phase before the
15m mark following starts in all strokes except for breaststroke (FINA, 2010).
Total start time for elite swimmers is typically between six to eight seconds
and is the time from the starting signal to when the center of the swimmer’s
head reaches the 15m mark (Cossor & Mason, 2001).
The start phase is typically broken into three phases for analysis: on-block, flight, and
underwater. A number of start techniques have been examined in the literature as a
result of new techniques being developed and changes in the start block itself. With
the introduction of the Omega OSB11 starting blocks to international competition,
many swimmers are now using a new kick-start technique during competition. The
new start block surface consists of two components: the main platform, which is
angled at 10 degrees; and an adjustable back plate, foot rest, or kick plate, which
is angled at 30 degrees to the main deck. The latter can be moved through five
consecutive steps of 35 mm that start 350 mm from the front edge of the block. The
performance differences between the 'kick-start' technique and earlier styles (such
as the track start, grab start, and swing start) mean that previous start literature
may not be relevant to what swimmers are currently employing during competition.
Research concerning the on-block and flight phase of the kick start has established
that utilizing the kick plate would allow swimmers to generate larger horizontal take-
off velocities, which translate into faster start performances (Honda et al., 2010).
The contribution of the underwater phase of the kick start has also been evaluated
and found to be important to overall start performance, particularly the trajectory
adopted by the swimmer to reduce the amount of drag acting on the swimmer (Tor
et al., 2015c).

Chapter 1: the importanCe of the Underwater phaSe
The start in swimming is crucial to performance in competition. Hence, this chapter
will summarize start literature and distinguish characteristics of the elite swimming
kick-start with particular emphasis on the underwater phase. The underwater
phase—the longest phase of swimming—has been identified as the most important
part of the start and is the point at which the swimmer is travelling the fastest through
the water. A number of different aspects of the swimming start's underwater phase
will also be explored. This phase contributes to guidelines for the ideal underwater
trajectory swimmers should adopt to reduce the amount of drag acting on them.
Background
Importance of the Swimming Start
Start times have been shown to be influential
to overall performance during competition,
contributing between 1-26% of total race time
depending on the distance of the event (Lyttle
& Benjanuvatra, 2005; Mason et al., 2007; Tor
et al., 2014b). Race analysis at the 1998 World
Swimming Championships in Perth showed
high correlations between start time and overall
performance, particularly in events 100 m or
less (Mason, 1999). Further, in correlational
Figure 1. Omega OSB11 Starting Block.
analysis of nine international competitions over
a seven-year period, Robertson et al. (2009) observed that fast starts were the
most successful strategy in shorter events for improving performance. Additionally,
Girold et al. (2001) found that for the women's 200 m freestyle, the first 50 meters
of the race was the most important variable for medalists at the Sydney Olympics.
Subsequently, any small improvements in time gained during the start phase of the
race can be advantageous to many elite swimmers, as they may result in significant
improvements to overall competition performance (Breed & McElroy, 2000).
The Kick-Start Technique
After the 2008 Beijing Olympics, a new start block (see: Figure 1) was introduced to
all international competition (Honda et al., 2010). Despite research on the new start
technique being scarce, studies that have compared start styles to the kick start
have suggested the use of the new technique is advantageous (Barlow et al., 2014;
Biel et al., 2010; Honda et al., 2010; Nomura et al., 2010; Takeda et al., 2013) This
advantage is due to Omega's claiming that the kick plate enables the swimmer to
push-off with a rear knee angle of 90°, which allows for optimal force production. As
a result of the perceived benefits, this start is now used by most swimmers during
competition.

Contemporary Swim Start reSearCh
The start position configuration of the kick start has also been studied. Honda et al.
(2012) investigated block position by testing kick-plate position and changing the
position of the swimmers' weight prior to leaving the block. In testing the theory
on elite swimmers, it was found that a neutral-weighted to slightly rear-weighted
kick start on the swimmers' preferred kick plate setting was the best combination
to produce the best dive performance (Honda et al., 2012). However, as swimmers
were asked to perform an unpreferred technique, results may have been skewed
in favor of the swimmers' preferred technique. Consequently, future start studies
should take into account the swimmers' preferred technique.
Comparisons between kick-start and track-start performance has also been
previously examined. Murrell and Dragunas (2013) compared the kick-start technique
to the grab start and found that the newer start was faster to 2 m on all occasions.
This study contained low subject (n = 4) numbers, did not allow swimmers to place
the kick plate at their desired positions and only used time to 2 m not time to 15 m
(the normal criterion for start performance). Similarly, Honda et al. (2010) found
that the kick start was faster than the track start to 5 and 7.5 m. This was due to a
faster block time and greater horizontal impulse. However, this study assessed dive
performance using a dive and glide technique to eliminate the influence of other
underwater variables, potentially changing the results when full dive performance
to 15 m was assessed. While a number of different study designs were used to
investigate the kick start, it is clear that the kick start is advantageous to overall start
performance if used correctly.
Phases of the Swimming Start
The start phase can also be broken into three phases: on-block, flight, and underwater
(Cossor & Mason, 2001; Elipot et al., 2009; Hay, 1986; Thow et al., 2012). The
on-block phase is typically defined as the time between the starting signal and the
time when the swimmer's feet leave the blocks. The flight phase begins when the
feet leave the block and ends when the swimmer's head makes contact with the
water. Finally, the underwater phase is defined as the interval between the head's
contact with the water and the head resurfacing.
On-Block Phase
The on-block phase is the time from the starting signal to the moment when the
swimmer's toe leaves the block (Guimaraes & Hay, 1985; Issurin & Verbitsky,
2002; Ruschel et al., 2007). Total on-block time is a combination of reaction time
(the interval between the starting signal and the first movement on the block) and
movement time (Garcia-Hermoso et al., 2013). However, there has been some
evidence that this phase changes depending on the swimmer's specialty event.
Regardless of event, a faster block time has been shown to directly relate to
improvements in overall start performance (Garcia-Hermoso et al., 2013; Vantorre
12
17_08_04_Contemporary_swim_start_RZ.indd 12 04.08.17 15:37

--- Page 14 Text ---
Chapter 1: the importanCe of the Underwater phaSe
et al., 2010). Conversely, a reduction in block time may be linked to lower impulse
and thus lower resultant peak forces. A reduction in impulse would also result in a
lower take-off horizontal velocity and would significantly affect subsequent phases
of the start (Lyttle & Benjanuvatra, 2005). Slawson et al. (2013) also stated that a
shorter block time, higher take-off velocity, and greater distance of entry does not
equate to better start performanes on all occasions. For example, a greater take-off
horiztonal velocity may lead to a larger entry hole, resulting in increased drag. This
result suggests that during the on-block phase, there is a trade-off between time on
block and force produced (Breed & Young, 2003). By using the kick-start technique,
research has shown that swimmers are able to generate slightly shorter block times
without sacrificing take-off horizontal velocity (Honda et al., 2010; Slawson et al.,
2013). Honda et al. (2010) suggest this benefit is because the additional kick plate
allows the back leg to be in a more advantageous position for force production.
Furthermore, similar to Honda et al. (2010), Garcia-Hermoso et al. (2013) assessed a
large amount of elite competitive data to compare on-block times between the track
and kick starts. They found that there were shorter on-block times when using the
kick start, which was a determining factor, particularly in the women's 50 m events.
As such, using the kick-start technique would generally allow swimmers to gain an
added advantage for better start performances over other start techniques.
Flight Phase
The flight phase is typically defined as the time from when the swimmer's toe leaves
the block to when the swimmer's head enters the water. In theory, swimmers would
be able to travel faster through the air than through water due to less resistance.
However, flight duration is not usually correlated with start time; it is flight distance
that is a determining variable of performance (Ruschel et al., 2007). Hence, to
improve start performance, swimmers should theoretically maximize the flight phase
by increasing entry distance. On the other hand, research has shown that leaving
the block with higher horizontal velocity results in an increased entry distance, at the
cost of a larger entry hole size and a flatter trajectory (Costill et al., 1992; Kirner et
al., 1989). A flatter trajectory would also result in a shallower underwater trajectory,
leading to more drag acting to slow the swimmer down. Similar to the on-block
phase, there is a trade-off: the length of the flight phase is a compromise between
take-off horizontal velocity, take-off angle, and entry distance (Miller et al., 1984).
Underwater Phase
The underwater phase is typically defined as the time from when the swimmers'
head enters the water to when the swimmer resurfaces again to commence free
swimming. The underwater phase can be further subdivided into the glide phase
and the underwater kicking phase. During the glide phase, the swimmer is travelling
the fastest through the water and typically adopts a streamlined position with arms
outstretched. The underwater phase is crucial to overall race performance because,
after the dive itself, this is the next fastest section of the race (Connaboy et al.,
13
17_08_04_Contemporary_swim_start_RZ.indd 13 04.08.17 15:37

--- Page 15 Text ---
Contemporary Swim Start reSearCh
2010). This phase has also been identified as the most decisive in order to achieve
faster overall start performances (Cossor & Mason, 2001; Elipot et al., 2009; Thow
et al., 2012). The average speed during this phase is highly dependent on horizontal
velocity at penetration into the water and drag forces acting on the swimmer during
the glide phase (Lyttle & Benjanuvatra, 2005).
Correlation analysis of start performances at the Sydney 2000 Olympics by Cossor
and Mason (2001) found that underwater distance during the start was negatively
correlated to overall start performance for the men's 200 m butterfly, 100 m
backstroke, and 100 m freestyle races. This result would suggest that as the
swimmers swam longer underwater, start time to 15 m improved due to a greater
underwater velocity being maintained by these swimmers. The analysis of the
women's events was similar to the men's events; it showed that those swimmers
who travelled further underwater were able to achieve faster overall start times.
However, Cossor and Mason (2001) did not examine any extra factors such as
maximum depth or timing of first kick in their study.
Another study by Elipot et al. (2009) aimed to determine the swimmers' loss of
speed during the underwater phase of the start by estimating the distance
between the swimmer and the start wall as the swimmer's velocity decreased.
The influencing factors were then analyzed. Eight swimmers performed three grab
starts to the best of their ability. Nine anatomical landmarks were then identified to
allow the calculation of velocity curves. A principal components analysis was used
to determine the factors that most influenced glide performance. The results of
this analysis suggest that following a start entry, swimmers should maintain their
streamlined position until the center of mass reaches a mean distance of about 5.63
and 6.01 m (Elipot et al., 2009). If swimmers wait too long to start leg movements,
they would lose approximately 0.4 m/s. Conversely, if swimmers were to commence
their leg movements prematurely, they would cause higher hydrodynamic resistance
and lose speed. However, with the introduction of the new starting blocks, the grab
start (which was used by Elipot et al. (2009)) has been phased out in favor of a kick
start (Jorgic et al., 2010).
Similarly, Houel et al. (2012) conducted a detailed three-dimensional (3D) analysis of
the underwater phase. Focusing on the glide, this was the first study to provide such
detailed recommendations on strategies to improve the underwater phase of the
swimming start. The authors suggest that swimmers should apply three principles to
improving the glide phase of the swimming start: to remain as streamlined as possible,
to start underwater undulatory kicking after 6 m using only the feet and legs, and to
improve the kick frequency of underwater undulatory swimming. Nevertheless, this
study focused on the grab start, and it was unclear in the methodology how many
trials were conducted. Thus, these findings may not apply to the kick-start technique,
given the differences in take-off horizontal velocity and entry.

Characteristics of an Elite Swimming Start
To enhance swimming start performance at the elite level, it is essential to first
investigate how elite swimmers start. A study by Tor et al. (2014a) employed a
large sample of elite Australian Olympic and World Championship representatives
to determine the characteristics of the kick-start technique. A number of different
parameters were shown to contribute to good start performances and were split
into above-water (parameters that occurred before the swimmer entered the water)
and underwater (parameters that occurred after the swimmer entered the water)
groupings. Table 1 displays a full summary of descriptive statistics of the parameters
examined in this study.

Components of the Swimming Start
The contributions of each sub-phase of the swimming start were examined in this
study and it was found that for elite athletes, 11% (0.74 s) was spent in the on-block
phase, 5% (0.30 s) in the flight phase, 56% (3.69 s) in the underwater phase, and
28% (1.81 s) free swimming (Tor et al., 2014a). The on-block and flight phase
contributions were the same as Blanksby et al. (2002) and Mason et al. (1997), who
examined the track-start. Furthermore, previous studies have not identified the exact
time contribution of the underwater phase to overall start performance. Hence, in
the study by Tor et al. (2014a) the time from head entry to 15 m was divided into
two sections: the underwater and free-swimming phases. The swimmers spent the
longest time in the underwater phase compared to the other sections of the start,
which highlights the underwater phase's importance to overall start performance.

Male vs Female
While there are obvious performance differences between male and female
swimmers, the research is limited in particular to using the kick-start technique (Tor
et al., 2014a). When comparing the contributions of each sub-phase, males spent
12% (0.72 s) in the on-block phase, 5% (0.29 s) in the flight phase, 61% (3.72 s)
in the underwater phase and 23% (1.39 s) free swimming. For females, 11%
(0.77 s) was spent in the on-block phase, 4.1% (0.29 s) in the flight phase, 51.9%
(3.67 s) in the underwater phase and 33.1% (2.34 s) free swimming. There were
also significant differences for specific parameters between male and female. Males
produced significantly larger horizontal take-off velocity (0.52 m/s-1, p < 0.001,
Large), peak horizontal force (0.22 Body Weight, p < 0.001, Large) and were also
able to produce faster underwater velocities than females for all segments. Males
also travelled significantly deeper (0.20 m, p < 0.001, Large) than females. For the
underwater parameters, there were significant differences in all average velocities
and split times, horizontal distance of max depth of head (0.08 m, p = 0.08,
Large), underwater velocity (0.27 m/s, p < 0.001, Large) and breakout distance
(1.33 m, p = 0.02, Small). These differences resulted in males being on average
0.95 seconds faster than females to 15 m. The results showed that there are clear
variances in start performance between male and female athletes: Males are better
able to generate greater force and velocity in the early phases of the start, which
translates into faster overall start performances.
Freestyle vs Butterfly
The same study by Tor et al. (2014a) was one of the first to compare the differences
between freestyle and butterfly for the kick-start technique. There were no
significant differences in the above-water parameters between the two strokes. The
differences existed in the underwater phase: Butterfly swimmers had a significantly
deeper max depth (0.21 m, p = 0.01, Large) that was further away from the start
blocks (0.82 m, p < 0.01, Large), spent more time underwater (1.10 s, p < 0.00,
Large), had a higher underwater velocity (0.12 m/s, p = 0.02, Medium), and a longer
breakout distance (2.24 m, p < 0.00, Large) than the freestyle swimmers. Even
though butterfly swimmers spent longer and travelled faster underwater, there were
no significant differences in overall start performances or split times. This finding
would suggest that freestyle swimmers commence free swimming earlier and are
able to compensate for a slower underwater velocity with higher free-swimming
velocity than butterfly swimmers.
Key Parameters of the Swimming Start
It is important for sport scientists and coaches to understand the key parameters
of start performance in order to enhance it. In a study by Tor et al. (2015c), take-

off horizontal velocity was identified as the most important parameter during the
above-water phase. An increase in take-off horizontal velocity would typically result
in the swimmer entering the water at a flatter angle. Hence, the effect of increasing
this parameter can be negated if the swimmer does not maintain velocity during the
underwater phase, due to an increased amount of resistance acting on him or her.
This finding further highlights the importance of identifying the ideal underwater
trajectory to reduce the amount of deceleration that occurs during the underwater
phase following entry into the water. Additionally, the key criteria of the underwater
phase for start performance were time underwater in descent, time underwater in
ascent, and time to 10 m. Extra specific statistical analysis also revealed that time
of maximum depth, time of first kick, and horizontal distance of maximum depth
would significantly affect the underwater phase. These parameters, along with
time underwater in descent, time underwater in ascent, and time to 10 m, would
affect the trajectory adopted by the swimmer. Therefore, developing greater take-
off horizontal velocity and focusing on the underwater phase by finding the ideal
trajectory would lead to improved start performance.
It has already been identified that the trajectory used by the swimmer during the
underwater phase would have implications on the amount of drag acting on the
swimmer and in turn the velocity achieved (Houel et al., 2012). To some extent,
the right combination of these variables is individual; however, there is still value
in identifying the main criteria that would contribute to start performance using
elite swimmers. These main parameters, identified using a large population of elite
swimmers, would provide coaches and sport scientists with a guide to improving
start performances in the future.
Three Common Underwater Trajectories
After having identified the importance of the underwater phase, particularly the
underwater trajectory, Tor et al. (2015a) aimed to compare underwater trajectories
using the kick-start technique with an elite population. In this study, swimmers were
asked to perform a series of freestyle dives at three depths. The depths were
categorized as Dive 1, Dive 2, and Dive 3. Dive 1 was typically characterized by
swimmers resurfacing as fast as possible with minimal underwater kick. During
Dive 1, the swimmers were asked to resurface and commence free swimming almost
immediately after entry. Dive 2 was a gradual descent followed by a gradual ascent.
For this dive, the swimmers were asked to dive deeper and aim to resurface around
the 10 m mark. Finally, during Dive 3 the swimmers were asked to dive down deep
and resurface to commence free swimming at the 15 m mark. Each dive trial was
tested using the Wetplate Analysis System. The Wetplate Analysis System is a
proprietary system developed by the AIS Aquatic Testing, Training, and Research

Chapter 1: the importanCe of the Underwater phaSe
Unit (ATTRU). It consists of an instrumented starting block with the same dimensions
as the Omega OSB11 starting block (that is used at all major international
competitions), and a series of high-speed cameras (Mason et al., 2012; Tor et al.,
2015d).
It was found that the fastest trajectory is a trade-off between the time spent
underwater and the maintenance of velocity generated during the first two phases
of the start. There were no significant differences between dive conditions for
average velocity during the 7.5–10m segment; however, there were differences in
the segment before (5–7.5 m) and after (10–15 m). Dive 1 would have been fully
surfaced and free swimming during this segment, while Dive 2 and Dive 3 would
have been in the underwater phase, but presumably at different depths. It is likely
that Dive 2 and Dive 3 would experience a larger deceleration during this segment
than Dive 1 due to the increase in resistance just below the surface of the water
and greater propulsion created through free swimming. Consequently, the higher
velocities achieved in the 5–7.5 m segment by Dives 2 and 3 are nullified during the
7.5–10 m segment due to Dive 1 free swimming while Dive 2 and Dive 3 were still
underwater. Consequently, the velocity achieved by the swimmer during the start
phase is not purely a result of the underwater phase; there are other parameters such
as free swimming velocity that would affect start performance. Overall, the trajectory
used in Dive 2 had the fastest time to 15 m, although this result was not significantly
different from the trajectory used in Dive 3. While the differences between each
dive condition were small, these changes are significant when working with an
elite population and can practically contribute to improving start performance. For

example, the top three finishers in the Men's 100m Freestyle at the 2007 FINA World
Swimming Championships were separated by only 0.04s (Hardt et al., 2009). Since
these margins can be so small, any advantage in reducing race time is important to
athletes, coaches, and sport scientists.
One key practical application from this study involves the selection of underwater
trajectories: coaches and swimmers must select a trajectory that is deep enough
to reduce the effect of drag while still not so deep as to require excessive amounts
of vertical travel and hence greater resultant distance. By adopting the correct
underwater trajectory, the swimmer is able to maintain a higher velocity for longer
during the underwater phase. Thus, swimmers should hold their glides for longer
and commence their first kicks later in the underwater phase. Specifically, it is
recommended that swimmers should commence the undulatory kick at approximately
6.6 m and achieve a maximum depth of approximately -0.92 m to minimize the
velocity lost during the underwater phase. This distance was the average used
during Dive 2 and therefore may be used as an early estimate. Commencing free-
swimming before this point would result in increased hydrodynamic resistance and
reduced velocity. These results are in evidence during Dive 1, where swimmers
commenced their first kick earlier.
How Does Drag Affect the Underwater Phase of the
Swimming Start?
During the underwater phase of the swimming start, drag is the largest resistance
acting in the opposite direction to slow the swimmer down. Hence, swimmers need
to adopt strategies to reduce this resistance. In short, there are three main types of
drag that will act on the swimmer during the underwater phase of the swimming
start: friction (or skin), form, and wave drag (Lyttle et al., 1998; Naemi et al., 2010;
Naemi & Sanders, 2008; Sheehan & Laughrin, 1992; Vennell et al., 2006). Frictional
drag represents the resistance produced from friction between the water and the
surface of the swimmer (Lyttle et al., 1998). Form drag is the result of the differences
between pressure at the leading and trailing edges of the body; boundary layer
separation from the swimmer is the principal contributor (Naemi et al., 2010).
The third primary component of drag is wave drag, which occurs when swimming at
or near the surface of the water. Wave drag is mainly caused by energy lost during the
creation of wave systems around the vessel or swimmer (Vennell et al., 2006). Wave
drag is considered the most deleterious of all the types of drag as it has been shown
to increase at a rate of up to the 6th power of speed, compared to linear and squared
relationships for friction and form drag, respectively (Lyttle et al., 1998; Vennell et
al., 2006). Knowledge of these relationships provides theoretical understanding of
selecting the correct underwater trajectory for better start performance.

Chapter 1: the importanCe of the Underwater phaSe
A study by Tor et al. (2015b) investigated how drag affects the swimmer during
the underwater phase of the swimming start. This study also determined how
the contributions of wave drag change with varying depths and speeds. Figure 3
displays the main results of this study, with total drag increasing as speed increases,
particularly as a result of large increases in wave drag at the surface. A strategy to
reduce total drag would be to travel well below the surface of the water. The value
of total drag is reduced as the swimmer travels deeper underneath the surface of the
water. In fact, this study found an 8-24% decrease in drag at speeds above 1.9 m/s
when the swimmer is travelling 0.5-1.0 m below the surface, respectively. Lyttle et
al. (1998) also found a 10-20% decrease in drag forces when travelling at 0.4-0.6 m
depths relative to gliding at the water surface, and a 7-14% reduction when gliding
at 0.2 m. Consequently, the large increases in total drag displayed as the swimmer
travels closer to the surface are likely due to the increased contribution of wave drag
in this study. This finding suggests that swimmers need to be mindful of travelling
at the surface, particularly during the breakout and transition from the underwater
phase to free-swimming during the start.
The results from this study can be used to make practical recommendations on
the optimal depth to reach during the underwater phase of the swimming start to
reduce the amount of wave drag acting on them (Tor et al., 2015b). Even though the
maximum speed used to tow swimmers was 2.5 m/s, the findings from this study
can still be applied to the speeds used during the underwater phase of the swimming
start. Earlier research by Tor et al. (2014a) found that elite swimmers can maintain
underwater velocities of 2.38 m/s throughout the underwater phase: at this speed,
there is an 80% decrease in wave drag when below depths of 0.5 m. Consequently,
swimmers should travel deeper than 0.5 m below the surface for as long as possible
to reduce the effects of drag, particularly the wave drag component. Swimmers
should also perform efficient breakouts when transitioning into free-swimming to
reduce the duration spent just below the surface. It is there that drag values are
reported to be at their largest.

wave drag vs speed (Tor et al. 2015b).

The depth at which the swimmer is travelling during the glide and undulatory kick
phase can have a positive effect on reducing hydrodynamic drag; hence the
trajectory adopted by the swimmer is important to reduce deceleration for good start
performances. The outcomes of Tor et al. (2014a) suggest that because the swimmer
spends much longer in the underwater phase, the trajectory used is paramount to
the overall success of start performances. This result is due to the fact the swimmer
would experience much more resistance travelling through water than air. Hence
any increases in magnitude of the first two phases would be immediately cancelled
out upon entry due to increases in deceleration if the swimmer uses an incorrect
trajectory. Given this finding, these recommendations have been able to refine earlier
work by Houel et al. (2012) and can now be applied practically using the kick-start
technique, which is currently being used by most swimmers in competition.
Through a number of research studies (Tor et al., 2014a, 2015a, 2015b, 2015c), a
set of theoretical guidelines were established for the ideal underwater trajectory,
which could be used to elicit reductions in drag. While it can be argued that each
swimmer’s underwater trajectory is individual and based on a number of factors such
as underwater kicking ability and anthropometric characteristics, ideal underwater
trajectory is still an optimization between not travelling too deep where there is an
advantage of wave drag reduction and minimal distance that would allow for an
efficient breakout. Thus, establishing evidence-based guidelines is useful for coaches
for a more targeted approach to start improvement.
The guidelines are displayed visually in Figure 4 (see next page) and listed below:
• Hold their glide for two seconds prior to the first kick.
• Travel at least 0.5 m below the surface for as long as possible.
• Have a maximum depth of between 0.9–1.0 m.
• Start the first kick after the center of the head reaches 6.5 m from the block.
• Aim to breakout around 10.5 m.
Adhering to the guidelines for achieving the ideal underwater trajectory would
reduce the amount of resistance acting on the swimmer, leading to the maintenance
of a higher velocity during the underwater phase without unnecessary energy loss.
Ultimately, following the guidelines would result in faster start performances.
Minimizing drag during the underwater phase would enable the propulsive efforts
in the forward direction to be maximized. In this case, reduction in drag would also
allow for more speed to be generated as the swimmer commences the undulatory
kick following the glide phase. Furthermore, combining these results with knowledge
of the swimmer’s underwater kicking ability and individual anthropometric
characteristics in future studies would allow for more individualized approaches to
achieving the ideal underwater trajectory.

Chapter Summary
The primary aim of this chapter was to provide coaches and sport scientists with
a resource detailing the characteristics of elite start performance. The swimming
start has been widely researched; however, past research primarily utilized older
starting techniques, which have been phased out with the introduction of the Omega
OSB11 starting block. Subsequently, elite kick starts were first characterized in
order to establish the contribution of each sub-phase to the overall start. Using the
same elite sample, this chapter identified a number of key parameters within the
underwater phase that would impact overall start performance. These criteria were
time underwater in descent, time underwater in ascent, and time to 10 m. Further
analysis also revealed maximum depth and time of first kick as additional factors that
would affect the underwater phase of the swimming start. The above-water phases
of the start were also examined in Tor et al. (2015c), and it was found that take-off
horizontal velocity was paramount. However, the effect of this parameter would be
negated if the swimmer did not optimize the underwater phase, due to the increased
amount of resistance that may act on the swimmer, causing deceleration.
As the underwater trajectory adopted by elite swimmers during the swimming start
was ascertained as important to overall start performance (Tor et al., 2014a, 2015b,

2015c), a subsequent comparative design was used by Tor, Pease, and Ball (2015a)
to determine which common underwater trajectory is the fastest. Three common
underwater trajectories were tested; it was found that the fastest trajectory was a
trade-off between a depth that was deep enough to reduce the effect of drag, and
shallow enough so that the swimmer was still travelling predominantly in the desired
horizontal direction. To provide a theoretical basis for these findings, this chapter
also explored the relationship between drag, depth, and speed. The main resistance
that acts to slow the swimmer down during the underwater phase is drag; hence
determining ways to reduce drag would allow for a higher velocity to be maintained
for longer. Tor et al. (2015a) found that swimmers should travel at least 0.5 m
below the surface of the water to reduce the amount of resistance acting on them.
Specifically, if swimmers travel below the surface at 0.5 m during the underwater
phase, they would experience approximately 80% less wave drag compared to
travelling at the surface.
This chapter has highlighted the importance of the underwater phase to efficient
kick-start performance in elite swimmers. While the recommendations stated
in this chapter specifically apply to the population of elite athletes sampled, the
findings would contribute to the development of evidence-based practice for sport
scientists and coaches. The practical implications of this research would also allow
sport scientists to provide specific coaching cues surrounding the key parameters
for better start performances. Knowledge of the key parameters that affect start
performance will allow sport scientists and coaches to adopt a more targeted
approach to start improvement.

Introduction
During freestyle events, swimmers’ underwater movements are not constrained
by any rules except one; the swimmers have to resurface by the 15 m mark.
Nevertheless, most of the top swimmers choose to employ underwater undulatory
movements, also called the dolphin kick, during which the legs’ movements are
synchronized and simultaneous.
Temporal analyses of the starts have clearly shown that start time is strongly
correlated to race time. Moreover, a closer view at starts reveals that the underwater
phases represent the main source of distinction between the athletes (Guimaeres &
Hay, 1985). However, only a limited number of studies were interested in
understanding those underwater phases over recent years. Consequently, little
information about the swimmers’ underwater efficiency is available.
General Mechanisms
The underwater part of the start consists of two phases: The gliding phase and
the leg propulsion phase. During the glide, the swimmer does not engage in any
propulsive actions and has to hold a streamlined position. He softly reorientates his
body from the initial entry position to a position suitable for starting the underwater
propulsion. The main objective of this gliding phase is to maintain as long as possible
the overall speed accumulated during the previous phases of the start (i.e. the
propulsion from the block and the aerial phase) by decreasing the hydrodynamic
resistance. The swimmer’s velocity at the water entry (when the hands are touching
the water) is indeed around 5 m/s and around 4 m/s when his body is entirely
submerged; the swimmer will not achieve any higher velocities during the other
moments of the race. During the underwater leg propulsion phase, the swimmer has

creates resistive force creates propulsive force
to maintain a velocity higher than the maximal velocity he can reach while swimming
at the surface and before he reaches the 15 m mark. To be efficient, he will obviously
have to decrease the hydrodynamic resistances, increase the propulsive forces, and
build an appropriate trajectory to assure a smooth return to the water’s surface.
The reduction of the hydrodynamic resistances involves controlling many factors.
Among these factors, the most important seems to be the position of the swimmer’s
body and his posture (full body extension, ventral vs lateral position, etc.), the depth
of the swimmer’s body, the anthropometric characteristics, and the limbs’ angles of
attack.
The angle of attack is defined as the angle between the main axis of the body and
the velocity vector. The production of propulsive forces during the underwater legs
propulsion is associated with the swimmer’s ability to produce a stable reverse
Karman vortex street. When a body is moving through a fluid like water, the
propulsive surfaces’ oscillations (combining heaving and pitching movements) create
a displacement of the particles of the fluid that are splitting and forming organized
structures named vortices. Under those conditions, two types of vortices can be
created. When the flow in the tailing edge of an oscillating object splits in alternating
counterclockwise and then clockwise semicircles, a regular Karman vortex street is
formed. This configuration leads to an ejection of fluid particles in the same direction
as the movement of the oscillating surface. The thrust produced is consequently
opposed to the movement and acts as a resistance.

Conversely, when the flow splits in the same semi-circles but alternating first
clockwise and then counterclockwise, a reverse Karman vortex street is created.
This configuration of vortices is associated with the ejection of fluid particles in the
opposite direction of the movement of the oscillating surface. In the second case, the
produced thrust creates some propulsive forces and eventually an acceleration of the
oscillating surface (Figure 1).
In the case of a swimmer producing undulatory movements underwater, the
production of the Karman vortex street is mainly associated with the values of the
angles of attack of the lower limbs and the values of the Strouhal number. The
Strouhal number describes the propulsive efficiency of a body oscillating in a fluid by
characterizing the transfer of momentum from the body to the water. The Strouhal
number is strongly associated with the amplitude-frequency ratio at a given velocity
and consequently also to the angles of attack of the lower limbs.
During all of the different parts of the underwater phase of the start, it clearly
appears that the swimmer has to manage the limbs’ angles of attack in a way to
find an optimal compromise. During the glide, he has to hold a streamlined position
and at the same time has to reorient his body. During the legs propulsion phase, he
has to find the balance between increasing the propulsive forces and reducing the
hydrodynamic resistances. To find such compromises, the swimmer has to be able to
adopt some very efficient motor control strategies. Underwater performance during
the starts is indeed determined directly or indirectly by the control of the limbs’
angles of attack. Nevertheless, the control of those angles of attack depends upon
the joints’ actions, which are themselves a consequence of the muscles’ contractions.
Finally, the muscles’ contractions are conditioned by the motor command sent
directly by the central nervous system. Facing such a complex chain of control is quite

a challenge for the swimmer to be efficient and achieve a good level of performance.
Motor control and learning theories propose an organization of the control of
voluntarily movement around three levels. The central nervous system, including
the brain and the spinal cord; the peripheral nervous system, made of the nerves
outside of the brain and spinal cord; and the muscular effectors. A good control
of the chain explained above implies that the swimmer’s central nervous system
produces efficient motor commands to send signals to the activated muscles through
the peripheral nervous system, which in turn processes the information coming back
from the different body sensors (eyes, inner ear, skin mechanoreceptors, etc.). The
complexity of the task during the underwater kicking phase forces the swimmer to
handle a large number of muscles, joints, and sensors. A motor strategy involving
an individual control of each one of those components wouldn’t be efficient. The
complexity of the task and amount of information indeed forces the swimmer to
develop a synergistic coordination of the joints and muscles. When applying such a
strategy, each muscle and joint is not controlled individually, but in groups sharing
the same motor task. The muscles and joints included in the same synergy are
controlled thanks to a unique motor command sent by the brain. The motor control
is therefore simplified and consequently more efficient (Figure 2). The produced
movements are more accurate and the performance higher.
The Underwater Gliding Phase
As for all the underwater parts of the start, the glide has not been often studied and
analyzed. Different previous works have pointed out the importance of the depth
of the glide and its impact on the hydrodynamic resistances. It indeed appears that
a depth of 1 m will induce a 2.4-time lower hydrodynamic resistance than when
gliding at the water’s surface (Vennel et al., 2006). Furthermore, Pease and Vennel
(2010) have shown that, when towing a mannequin at an 0.8-m depth and a speed
of 2.15 m/s, the hydrodynamic resistances are strongly associated to the angles of
attack of the mannequin. However, the relationships between the limbs’ angles of
attack, the joints’ angles, and the motor strategies used by swimmers to control
them, have never been investigated or described. To understand the motor strategies
involved during the gliding phase of the start, a complete kinematical analysis of a
group of French top-level swimmers was conducted. The center of mass velocity,
the lower limbs’ joints’ angles (hip, knee, ankle, and shoulder), and the limbs’ angles
of attack (trunk, thigh, leg, and feet) were measured while the swimmers were
performing competitive starts (at maximum intensity). The application of different
mathematical and statistical procedures (principal component analyses and cross-
correlation functions) on the data allowed for identifying the specific coordination
used by the swimmers to control their joints during the glide.

Chapter 2: Underwater GlidinG and UndUlatory SwimminG after Start
The interpretation of the different results points to the existence of a specific
motor strategy clearly designed to control the angles of attack of different limbs
(Figure 3). The control of the angles of attack during the gliding phase is indeed
organized around two joints’ synergies. The first synergy regroups the actions of
the hip and shoulders and mainly aims to control the angles of attack of the trunk.
The gliding phase of the start has double specificity: keeping a streamlined position
and reorienting the body; the goal of this first synergy is to control the postural
component of the phase by minimizing the angles of attack of the trunk. When
an internal or external perturbation leads to an increase of the trunk’s angles of
attack, the synergy produces a very fast (a few ms), common and synchronized
response by the shoulders and the hips that will lower the angles of attack in return.
Consequently, the postural synergy constrains the trunk’s angles of attack to small
values when the swimmer’s body is facing some instability.
The second synergy aims to control the actions involved in reorientation after the
water entry. This synergy regroups and coordinates the knee and ankle movements
and allows managing the feet and legs’ angles of attack. Finally, the thighs’ angles
of attack are controlled by both synergies. At the beginning of the movement, when
the thigh’s angles of attack have to be slightly increased to change the orientation
of the body, the locomotor component takes the lead to control it. Conversely, for
the rest of the glide, the angles of attack of the thigh appear to be mostly controlled
by the postural component as explained before for the angles of attack of the trunk.
Consequently, during the gliding phase of the start, it appears that the limbs’ angles
of attack are managed through two synergies aimed at controlling the main joints’
angles. Each of these synergies is respectively in charge of maintaining the body’s
streamlined position reorientation after the water entry. And, for the group of
swimmers that were analyzed, the stronger these two synergies were, the faster the
athletes swam during the glide.

Underwater Undulatory Swimming
As for the glide, underwater undulatory swimming has rarely been investigated
nor have the relationships between the motor control strategies applied by the
swimmers and the key biomechanical parameters of the performance (i.e., the limbs’
angles of attack). Different scientific researches or empirical remarks indicate that,
depending on the source, the action of a single joint, whether the ankle, the knee,
or the hip, may explain the differences in performance between swimmers during
the underwater kicking phase. Arellano and his colleagues (Arellano et al., 2003)
showed, for example that a population of international-level swimmers was scoring
lower knee angles than a population of regional- and national-level swimmers. Also,
it pointed out the existence of a top-down activation of the joints starting from the
hip (or the shoulders) and going down to the ankles. Nevertheless, the existence of a
general motor control strategy and its potential impact on the limbs’ angles of attack
has never really been discussed. Furthermore, the connections and relationships
between the different joints’ actions and their control haven’t been studied, while
it’s been shown as determinant in many other “dynamic” motor activities (walking,
running, jumping, etc.).
The identification of the joints’ coordination during underwater undulatory swimming
also required first a full kinematical analysis of the movements. The center of mass
velocity, the joints’ angles of the lower limbs (hip, knee, and ankle) and the limbs’
angles of attack (trunk, thigh, leg, and feet) were recorded for a population of French
top-level swimmers performing underwater undulatory movements at maximum
intensity after a competitive start. The analysis of the motor coordination showed
that underwater undulatory kicking is characterized by two different synergies.
Consequently, to control his limbs and be efficient, the swimmer sends two motor
commands: To the ankle and the hip (synergy 1), and to the knee (synergy 2). These
two synergies have the same importance to control movements; they are connected
to each other but have mutual compensative consequences. The motor strategy used
by a swimmer to control the limbs’ angles of attack during underwater undulatory
kicking is indeed organized as a full circle, where the commands of the hip-ankle pair
has a consequence on the knee actions and the commands of the knee leads to a
reaction of the pair ankle/hip (Figure 4, see next page).
When a command is sent to the hips and ankles to modify their angles (ankle
flexion / hip extension), the angles of attack of the feet and trunk are increased. The
information associated with these increases is processed by the swimmer’s brain
and consequently, the production of a second motor command is sent to modify the
action of the knee by increasing its flexion. The increase of the knee flexion leads to
the increase of the thigh’s angles of attack. These first two commands consequently
produce actions of the hip, knees, and ankles that result in the general increase of
the lower limbs’ angles of attack, which is required to produce the propulsive forces

through the mechanism of the reverse Karman vortex streets. Nevertheless, the
general increase in the angles of attack is quickly regulated and lowered, thanks
to the actions of the two synergies. Indeed, when the trunk’s angles of attack are
increased, the information will be processed by the swimmer and results in a new
motor command sent to the group hip/ankle. This new motor command aims to
reduce the ankles’ flexion and hip extension, which consequently decreases the
angles of attack of the feet and trunk. In the same way, the information about this
decrease is processed by the swimmer and leads to a decrease in the knee flexion,
which also consequently decreases the thighs’ angles of attack.
As a result, during the underwater undulatory propulsion phase of the start, it
appears that the limbs’ angles of attack are controlled thanks to a motor strategy
oriented around two synergies. The organization of these synergies manages the
limbs’ angles of attack in such a way that when their values begin to slightly increase,
an opposite action of the joints aims to reduce them. In this organization, all the
lower joints are working together at the same time and priority is clearly given to the
frequency of the kicking movement than to its amplitude.
Transition Phase
A determining element to achieving a high level of performance during the start is
executing a good transition between the end of the glide and the beginning of the
legs’ propulsion. An early initiation of the underwater movements may lead to the
loss of the extra velocity created during the previous phases of the start, and a late
initiation may cause an important deceleration (Blanksby et al., 1996). Measuring
the mechanical energy output of a group of French top-level swimmers, it clearly
appeared that most of them were inefficient while kicking underwater because of a

bad transition between the glide and the legs’ propulsion. The internal and external
kinetic energies and the center of mass velocity were measured and compared
for starts without any underwater undulatory movements (just gliding as long as
possible) and regular competitive starts (with underwater propulsion) (Figure 5).
Figure 5. Swimmers' kinetic energy during the underwater phase of the start (adopted from
Mullen, 2014).
The resulting comparisons pointed out that during the main part of the underwater
phase of the start, the swimmers were performing leg movements, spending a lot
of external and internal kinetic energy, but without being able to produce higher
velocities than for a start without any movements. Consequently, during most of
the underwater phase of the starts (70% of the underwater swum distance), the
swimmers were wasting energy and even losing speed and time.
The comparisons also showed that the swimmers’ general intentions when
performing a competitive dive were wrong. The starts were indeed characterized
by the swimmers’ intentions: To reach the water’s surface faster than during the
starts without any propulsive movements, and to begin the underwater undulatory
movements very early. The maximum depth during the competitive starts was
indeed approximately 25% less important than for the starts without any movements
(0.87 m vs 1.08 m), which had the direct consequence of increasing the swimmers’
drag. The slope of the swimmers’ trajectory was also more important for the
competitive starts than for the starts without any propulsion. Moreover, using the
conclusions from Lyttle et al. (2000), it appeared that all the swimmers were starting
the underwater undulatory movements too early. By initiating their underwater
undulatory movements too soon, the swimmers created higher hydrodynamic
resistances and therefore very quickly lost the extra velocity obtained, thanks to the
previous phases of the start and wasted energy.

In conclusion, the swimmers did not take any advantage of the start because of their
inefficiency in identifying the right moment to start the underwater legs’ movements.
Having the intention to create high velocities and to act fast, the swimmers were
instead precipitating their actions, leading to a loss of speed and time. Swimmers
were presenting a wrong general representation of an efficient start and were unable
to use the appropriate information to control their movements.
Performance Improvement and Motor Learning
The motor strategies described above seem to be determinant in controlling the
limbs’ angles of attack and achieving a good level of performance during both
the gliding phase and underwater undulatory swimming. Motor control theories
indicate that such synergies as described above may be acquired through different
methods. Some can be naturally available and developed thanks to the expression
of the genetic characteristics of the swimmer, while some others can be learned
and improved thanks to different learning programs. The first modifications of the
motor synergies and behaviors can theoretically appear after just a few weeks of
appropriate training. Deeper and more permanent motor adaptations will occur later
when applying a longer motor learning program. Different works have investigated
the effects of a specific motor learning program on the improvement of the
performance for a various set of activities. Nevertheless, no information has been
published or communicated about the biomechanical, neuro-muscular, and cognitive
modifications following a motor learning program centered on the underwater phase
of the start.
Under those conditions, it seemed a priority to design a motor learning program and
identify and evaluate the potential modifications occurring for a group of young, well-
trained, and competitive swimmers. The motor learning program was made of four
types of learning situations: Goal-oriented situations based on the explanation of the
optimal model of the task; situations aimed at the acquisition of sensorimotor and
energetic skills (in the water or outside); biofeedback situations (operant conditioning)
using visual (mainly video) and kinematic feedback for different static and dynamic
exercises; and situations with added constraints. This learning program was applied
to a group of young French competitive swimmers (national level), aged from 13
to 16 years old and training approximately 12 hours per week. Three sessions of
30 minutes each were applied over eight weeks (before or after regular training or
incorporated within training), and complete kinematic and neuro-muscular analyses
were conducted before and after the program.
After the training program, all the swimmers were scoring higher velocities while
performing underwater undulatory movements. These velocities were indeed
37

Contemporary Swim Start reSearCh
approximately 20% higher on average, which points to a clear improvement of
the swimmers’ performances. Facing such ameliorations, the kinematical and
neuromuscular analyses provide key information in understanding the sources
of the recorded modifications. The data indeed underlie that the improvement of
performance cannot be explained by a general increase or decrease of the distance
per cycle. Some swimmers have indeed scored higher distances while others
scored smaller. On the other hand, it appears that the swimmers have adjusted
the amplitude/frequency ratio, increasing in most of the cases the frequency and
decreasing the amplitude of the movement (Table 2).

The analysis of the upper limbs angles of attack shows that the swimmers have
modified their motor control strategies to regulate the positions of the upper parts of
the body during the underwater kicking. The angles of attack of all the upper limbs
(trunk, arms, forearms, hands) are indeed strongly decreased, leading consequently
to a reduction of the hydrodynamic resistances. Nevertheless, the modification of
the angles of attack values cannot be associated with an adaptation of the motor
behavior of a specific and single joint. For example, some swimmers were scoring
higher shoulders’ angles, while some others lower (and the same for the elbows and
wrists) (Table 3).
Similarly, in analyzing the lower limbs’ angles attack in relation to the swimmer’s
velocity, it appears that the estimated propulsion efficiency of the thighs, legs, and
feet was improved after the training program in most of the cases. As for the upper
limbs, this improvement cannot be explained by a modification of the motor behavior
of a unique and single joint. Indeed, the joints’ angles appear to decrease, increase, or
stay the same depending on each swimmer. The propulsion efficiency amelioration
cannot be therefore associated with an increased flexion or extension of a given joint
(Table 4). Consequently, the performance improvement during underwater kicking
after the training program must be related to a more complex modification of the
global motor strategy used by the swimmers to realize their movements.

When applying a motor learning program to a group of people, the first adaptations
that occur are neuromuscular ones. The electromyography analysis of five main
muscles groups (hamstrings, quadriceps, gluteus maximus, gastrocnemius, and
lumbar muscles) allowed collecting precious information about the evolution of the
swimmers’ motor strategies. Two parameters of the muscular contractions were
indeed clearly modified after the training program, i.e. the type of contractions and
the synchronization of the contractions. The analysis of the contraction types for the
lower-limb muscles (hamstrings, quadriceps, gluteus maximus, and gastrocnemius)
indicates that these muscles have a shorter duration of contraction but a similar and
even higher quantity of contraction (Table 5). Their modes of contraction progressed
from the tonic type of contraction to a phasic one, much more appropriate to
performing movements with high frequencies like underwater undulatory swimming.
39
17_08_04_Contemporary_swim_start_RZ.indd 39 04.08.17 15:37

--- Page 41 Text ---
Contemporary Swim Start reSearCh
On the other hand, the analysis of the contraction type of the lumbar muscles pointed
out that the duration of contractions was equivalent to those measured after the
training program, but the quantity of contractions was decreased (Table 5). The
mode of contraction changed from the phasic type to a tonic one. A tonic type of
contraction of the lumbar muscles allows the swimmers to reduce the upper limbs’
angles of attack and especially the trunk’s. Such a mode of contraction also prevents
the suffusion of undulatory leg movements to the upper parts of the body.
The analysis of the moments of contractions indicated that the synchronizations of
muscle actions have been modified after the training program. Before the program,
the muscle contractions were done independently and were not related to any
specific phase of the undulatory kicking movement. After the training program, the
contractions of the hamstrings and gluteus maximus were synchronized together and
completed at the beginning of the upbeat, while the contractions of the quadriceps
and gastrocnemius were synchronized together at the beginning of the downbeat.

Conclusions and Applied Recommendations
The underwater phases of the start are quite complex tasks. The achievement of a
good level of performance requires understanding a large number of biomechanical
parameters, starting with the angles of attack, and managing the learning of a
multidimensional motor strategy.

Chapter 2: Underwater GlidinG and UndUlatory SwimminG after Start
The swimmer’s efficiency is determined by his ability to reduce the hydrodynamic
resistances while performing some specific actions, such as reorienting the body
after the water entry or producing propulsive forces during underwater undulatory
swimming. The reduction of hydrodynamic resistance is strictly associated to the
decrease of the limbs’ angles of attack. The production of the propulsive forces is due
to the creation of a reverse Karman vortex street. The reverse Karman vortex street is
correctly produced when the swimmer is able to perform an underwater undulatory
kick having adequate values of angles of attack and amplitude/frequency ratio (with
a high frequency).
The control of the limbs’ angles of attack during both the glide and the underwater
propulsion appears to be the result of synergistic actions of sets of joints working
together as groups. The actions of a single and specific joint do not seem to be more
important than the actions of another joint. The appropriate angles of attack and the
kicking frequency are indeed the result of the interactions between each joint.
The start is also a “step by step” process. To be efficient, a swimmer has to respect
each step without trying to precipitate the beginning of the next one. Once the
body is entirely submerged in the water, the swimmer has to start the underwater
undulatory kicking at the optimal moment. In most cases, the swimmers precipitate
the beginning of their kicking movements. In the same way, the swimmer has to find
the optimal moment to return to the water’s surface and start the swim.
Finally, a short motor learning program can lead to strong and important performance
improvements. The swimmers are then able to change their amplitude/frequency
ratio by increasing the frequency, reducing the upper limbs’ angles of attack, and
modifying and resynchronizing the muscle contractions.

Introduction
While clear advantages have been reported for the track start new OSB11,
newly called the kick start, as compared to the old OSB9 starting block model
(e.g. Honda et al., 2010; Biel et al., 2010) there is a dearth of research about
the optimal stance position on the OSB11 with respect to the swimmers' leg
preference, the stance width, and the CM position. While the rear-weighted
track start for the old OSB9 was shown to offer advantages over the front-
weighted track start (Welcher et al. (2008), it remains unclear whether this
virtue is maintained with the use of the OSB11 and its new foot plate and
a slightly longer and more inclined start block surface. While swim start
positions on the new block have been examined regarding leg preference and
stance width already (e.g., Slawson et al., 2011; Takeda et al., 2012; Barlow
et al. 2014), only limited knowledge is available about the optimal spatial
position of the center of mass (CM). This measure has been shown earlier to
influence block time as a major prerequisite of swim start performance (Hay
& Guimaraes, 1983; Fischer, 2013).
Here we report about a comparative study that was conducted to analyze systematic
variations of the preferred stance position in the track start of five female and 12
male elite swimmers on the OSB11 (Kibele et al., 2015). Variations of the individually
preferred stance were examined regarding the front leg (left vs right), the CM height
(low vs high), the stance width (narrow vs wide), and a weighted stance (rear vs
front) estimated by the horizontal distance of the hip joint to the front edge of
the block. The size of the variations was expressed relative to the individual leg
length. Kinematic and kinetic measures were analyzed to evaluate the swim start
performance. In addition, a cluster analysis on joint angles (shoulder, elbow, hip,
knee, and foot) was conducted to identify the most typical strategies in the preferred
stance condition.

Methods
Subjects
Seventeen elite swimmers (five females ranging between 24.8 ± 2.7 years of age;
1.74 ± 0.02 m in height, 63.8 ± 5.09 kg in body mass; and 12 males ranging between
23 ± 1.5 years of age; 1.88 ± 0.07 m in height; and 83.6 ± 11.7 kg in body mass)
participated in the study. All subjects reported the front crawl to be their preferred
swimming style, except for one male and one female, with a preference of butterfly
swimming.
Instrumentation
For the kinematic data analysis, two video cameras (Sony DCR-TRV900E Pal-
operated at 50 Hz) were placed vertically at a height of 1.35 m above the water level
and horizontally in parallel to the front edge of the block, and at 5 m after the block.
While the first camera was used to analyze the take-off behaviour on the block, the
second camera was used to capture the time between the starting signal and the
head passage at 5 m. A 2D-strain-gauge equipped starting block (Kibele, 2004)
with an OSB11 surface measured the horizontal and vertical ground reaction forces.
Procedures
Systematic variations of the preferred stance position accounting for the CM heights
and distances relative to the front edge of the block, as well as the stance width, were
related to the standard deviations (SD) found in a preceding pilot study (Experiment
1 in Kibele et al., 2013) with six male and seven female elite swimmers (females
ranging from 22.1 ± 4.0 years of age; 1.78 ± 0.06 m in height; 65.2 ± 5.4 kg in body
mass; and males ranging from 23.8 ± 2.3 years of age; 1.90 ± 0.03m in height; and
85.8 ± 5.4kg in body mass). Here, the means and SDs in the above measures were
expressed relative to the individual leg lengths of the male and female swimmers
separately. For the present study, these SDs were reconverted to meters for males
and females separately according to the leg length of each subject. These measures
were then added or subtracted to the preferred stance configurations (Figure 1, left).
Thus, in addition to the preferred stance, eight configurations were possible for each
leg: CM height (low vs high) x CM distance (rear vs front weighted stance), and stance
width (narrow vs wide). However, because of motor coordination demands only four
of the eight possible configurations for each leg could be eventually maintained on
the block. The configurations consisted of a narrow stance with CM position high-
front (No.1), a wide stance with CM position high-back (No.2), a wide stance with
CM position low-front (No.3), and a wide stance with CM position low-back (No.4).
Hence, aside from the preferred stance, a total of eight swim-start variations were
analyzed. Three trials were used for each configuration. Prior to the various trials,
the subjects performed starts in their preferred stance conditions. Subsequently,
the variations of the stance configuration were analyzed in random order and across

three non-consecutive days. For simplicity reasons, the hip-joint landmark was
used as an estimate of the CM location. For the stance width of a male subject,
for example, the SD 0.66 from the pilot study was multiplied with the given leg
length of a subject and the result was added to the preferred stance width (wide) or
subtracted (narrow). Then, the closest footplate position was used for the swim start
trial. A video display was used to control the required stance configurations. Here, an
overlay reference grid (Figure 1) was used to indicate the various hip joint positions.
Figure 1. Stance parameters: CM-length (rear weighted vs front weighted start), CM-height
(high vs low), and step length (narrow vs wide).
Parameters
For each subject, the mean values across valid trials were evaluated for the following
kinematic take-off parameters: block time, horizontal take-off velocity (mean velocity
across the first three images in the flight phase), take-off angle (inclination of CM
trajectory during the first three images in the flight phase), flight distance (between
front end of the block and the point of hip entry) relative to the body height, entry
angle (inclination of the CM-hand interconnection), and hip angle at entry (angle
between shoulder, hip, and knee joint at hand entry). For the take-off dynamics, the
vertical and horizontal peak forces were evaluated across the valid trials. Swim start
performance was evaluated by the time between the starting signal and the head
passage at 5 m.

Statistics
For the statistical data evaluation, an analysis on variance for repeated measures
was conducted with the stance configurations and preferred vs non-preferred leg as
factors. For the cluster analysis, the Ward’s method was adopted.
Results
For the evaluation of typical strategies in the preferred stance, three clusters were
identified: elevated CM height, large step size, rear-weighted CM position (N = 3);
intermediate CM height, large step size, front-weighted CM position (N = 8);
and low CM height, small step size, intermediate CM position (N = 6). Across all
stance variations, the deviations for the hip joint landmark from the target position
were -0.049 ± 0.039 m in the vertical direction and -0.040 m ±0.053 m in the
horizontal direction. To prevent overlapping in CM locations in the different stance
configurations, trials were excluded from the statistical data analysis if their CM
deviation from the target was larger than the smallest difference between the various
target CM locations. Subsequently, 12% of all the trials were excluded.
For the valid trials, nine of the 17 subjects showed swim start improvements for
the stance alternatives better than the preferred stance position. However, for six
swimmers, alterations of their preferred stance configuration caused a deteriorated
swim start time. Across all subjects, the mean improvements were found as large
as 0.06 s. The largest increase in the swim start time was 0.14 s. In the analysis of
variance for repeated measures, a significant main effect for the front leg factor could
not be found in any of the kinematic and dynamic variables, or in the swim start time.
For the stance factor, swim start parameters with significant main effects are listed in
Table 1. For the remaining variables the level of significance was missed.

Shortest block times were found for the front-weighted CM positions (numbers 1
and 3). No differences were observed between the preferred and non-preferred
leg except for the high-front narrow stance (number 1) with superior values for the
non-preferred leg. Accordingly, an interaction effect was found between the front
leg factor and the stance factor (F = 5.2*; eta2 = 0.66). Best swim start times to 5 m
were found in the front-weighted CM positions as well. No differences between the
preferred and non-preferred leg were identified except for the high CM positions
(numbers 1 and 2). Here, best values were observed for the non-preferred leg. In
contrast, the largest horizontal take-off velocities were found independent of the leg
in the back CM positions. For the front-high CM position with narrow-stance width,
a slightly smaller take-off velocity was found in the non-preferred leg. The largest
horizontal peak forces were present for front CM positions. A significant difference
between the preferred and the non-preferred leg was not observed.
Discussion
The presented results indicate that for the majority of the elite swimmers, the
best swim start performance was found in another stance configuration than the
preferred one. There was a clear tendency showing that a forward shift to high CM
position with a narrow stance would provide best biomechanical conditions for a
fast swim start to 5 m. Here, subjects were able to produce large horizontal peak
forces while block times remained small. These benefits were not counterbalanced
by the smaller horizontal take-off velocities observed for the frontal stance positions.
These advantages in the take-off velocity are based on the longer block times
and acceleration pathways with lower forces amplitudes. A main objection to the
presented results regards swimmers (33 percent) who have found their best stance
positioning from the beginning. Variations in their stance configuration led to a
deterioration of the swim start performance. In addition, it is unclear whether swim
start performance is unambiguously evaluated by the time to the 5 m mark.
Conclusion
The presented results indicate that swimmers aiming for their best stance positioning
may want to shift their CM towards the front edge of the block with a high CM
position and a narrow stance to improve their swim start performance.

eValUating relay StartS in Swimming
Sebastian Fischer, University of Kassel, Germany
In collaboration with Armin Kibele, University of Kassel
Introduction
Swimming in a relay race is different from swimming in an individual race. While
the motivational influences of relay events are still under debate (e.g., Hüffmeier
et al., 2012; Skorski et al., 2016) the most visible differences between relay
and individual race performance can be found in the starting behavior from the
block. Relay swimmers may use any starting technique they wish as long as their
feet don't lose touch with the starting platform before the preceding teammate
touches the wall (FINA rule SW 10.11).
Here, we will present three studies on relay starts. In the first study, an evaluation
of international relay races will be provided on the advantages of relay swim starts
vs individual race swim starts. In the second study, we aim to show that relay
start instructions on when to initiate the take-off movement, as given in popular
swimming science textbooks, may be incorrect. In the last study, we provide
descriptive information on the start techniques for the relay events during the 2012
Olympic Games in London.
Study 1: Is Relay Start More Effective Than Individual Race Start?
In the past, only few studies have been published on relay start performance. In
this regard, mostly step-up techniques (e.g., McLean et al. 2000; Kibele & Fischer,
2010; Takeda et. al., 2010) and change-over time strategies were analyzed (e.g.,
Siders, 2010; Saavedra et al., 2014; Fischer & Kibele, 2014). In this study, we aim to
show that relay starts in general are more efficient than individual race starts. For
that purpose, a statistical data analysis was conducted for 58 relay swimmers on
positions 2nd to 4th in the 100 m freestyle finals of the 2010 European Championships
at Budapest and the 2011 FINA World Championships at Shanghai who also
competed in the individual race semi-finals or finals of the same championships
(data source: www.omegatiming.com). For the individual events, the fastest race

times were analyzed in the semi-finals or the finals, the corresponding reaction times,
and the split times for the first and second lap. For the comparison of relay races
and individual events, the race times and split times were adjusted by eliminating
the change-over times for the relay event and the reaction times for the individual
event. The difference between the adjusted race times and split times was used as
an indicator of the effectiveness of the relay start.
For the statistical data evaluation, the adjusted split times for the first lap (0-50 m),
for the second lap (50-100 m), and for the complete race times were analyzed for
the women (n = 27) and men (n = 31) separately and in conjunction. An analysis
of variance (ANOVA) was calculated for the event (individual vs relay) as repeated
within-subject factor and gender as between-subject factor. In addition, paired
t-tests were evaluated for the differences in the adjusted race times and split times.

A highly significant main effect (F = 24.60, p < 0.01, η2 = 0.31) for the factor
(1,56)
event was found in the adjusted race times (Figure 1). For the adjusted split times
of the first lap (Figure 2, left), this effect was maintained (F = 24.80, p < 0.01,
(1,56)
η2 = 0.31) and confirmed by the data of Skorski and coworkers (Skorski et al. 2016).
There was no main effect for the factor gender and no interaction between the
event and gender factors. For the split times on the second lap (50-100 m), the main
effect for the event factor was significant as well (F = 4.26, p < 0.05, η2 = 0.07).
(1,56)
However, the corresponding effect size η2 was only medium. In this respect, paired
t-tests for the male and female swimmers in the split times (50-100 m) did not reach
the level of significance.
The results indicate that the relay start from the block is effective for the consecutive
swimming times in the pool when compared to individual starts. This effect can be
observed predominantly for the adjusted split times on the first lap and is carried
on to the total race times. An additional data analysis of the first relay swimmer
(position 1) showed no differences between relay races and individual races for the
male and female athletes. Therefore, we conclude that the indicated time differences
between the relay and the individual events in relay positions 2nd to 4th were not
due to motivational differences.
In conclusion, based on our data analysis, an advantage of the relay start over the
individual start for subsequent swimming times can be asserted. This advantage is
most prominent on the first lap.
Study 2: When to Initiate the Relay Start Take-Off?
Relay swimmers may start their windups at any time and with any arbitrary
movement technique as long as their feet do not lose touch with the starting
platform before the incoming swimmer touches the wall. Consequently, the outgoing
swimmer must make judgments related to, on one hand, the incoming swimmer’s
speed, movement structure, and distance to the wall. On the other hand, he must
match the chosen movement cues to the time frame of his own relay start technique.
As different start techniques are found in international relay meets (see study 3
below), the problem of finding suitable movement cues to exercise with during
training and competition and with different relay teammates and pool conditions
turns out to be somewhat complicated.
For the traditional parallel start with circular arm swing, outgoing swimmers have
been advised to initiate their windup when the incoming swimmer’s head crosses
the T of the black line marker on the bottom of the pool or has one arm recovery
remaining before touching the wall (e.g., Maglischo, 2003:279f). For the latter, an

approximate time to wall contact of 0.60 s is assumed to be equivalent to the time
necessary for the outgoing swimmer’s feet to leave the block once the arms are
moving in a circular backswing motion. In order to examine this strategy and its
underlying time constraints, a pilot study with six male and three female swimmers
from the German national swimming team was conducted during a training camp
prior to the 2010 World Championships. The average personal best 100m freestyle
times were 49.0 ± 0.44 s for the male participants and 54.5 ± 0.65 s for the female
swimmers.
The goal of this study was to analyze the times between the wall contact and the
incoming swimmer’s head crossing the T from a lateral perspective and from the
outgoing swimmer’s perspective on the block. In addition, for the last arm movement
of the incoming swimmer, the time between the water emersion of the hand in the last
arm stroke and the wall contact was evaluated. For the time when crossing the T from
the outgoing swimmer’s perspective, a 50 Hz DV camera (Canon Legria HV 40 with
a shutter aperture of 1/500 s) was used. This camera was located at 1.50 m above
and 0.10 m behind the front edge of the starting block. For the lateral perspective, the
same camera type was used for an underwater analysis. Here, the camera was placed
in a waterproof aluminum box 0.30 m below the water’s surface, 3.75 m off the pool
wall in the swimming direction, and 1.5 m distant from the pool side. The average
values of two wall approaches per swimmer were used for a statistical data analysis.
Table 1 shows the three time measures for the swimmers tested.

from the frontal perspective (0.66 ± 0.10 for n = 6 male and

The results show that the time between the hand emersion in the last arm stroke
and the wall contact was found to be somewhat longer than 0.60 s. However, taking

in account a reaction time of approximately 0.15 s, a time period of approximately
0.55 s would be available for the wind up. In turn, a 0.60 s may be a suitable time
estimate for a windup movement as average times for a countermovement jump with
preferred countermovement amplitude are located within this time frame (Kibele,
1998). Although the lengths of last arm strokes may vary randomly from race to race
as well as between male and female swimmers, it appears that instructing subjects
to generally start their windup at the hand emersion point may be an appropriate
cue on a general scale.
Alternatively, instructing subjects to start their windup when the incoming swimmer’s
head crosses the T may be crucial. Here, our results show an average time of 0.97 s
between the incoming swimmer’s wall contact and his head crossing the T from
the side perspective. This time corresponds well with a 2-m estimate based on the
last 5-m finishing times in 100-m freestyle events of Japanese swimmers (1.04 s
for 113 male swimmers with an average race time of 50.80 ± 0.88 s, and 1.16 s
for 117 female swimmers with an average race time of 57.24 ± 1.10 s; Suito et al.,
2015) or in the eight 50 m finalists of the European Swimming Championships 2012
(0.83 s with an average race time: 22.20 ± 0.24 s Nazeer et al., 2016). Therefore, we
conclude that the 0.60 s suggested by Maglischo (2003, 279) does not correspond
to the time between the head passage at the T and the wall contact taken from a
side perspective. Moreover, it has to be emphasized that this time may be available
to the coach at the pool side only but not to the swimmer on the block with a frontal
perspective of the incoming swimmer.

In contrast to the side perspective, the time between the incoming swimmer’s wall

0.31 ± 0.05 s. Consequently, the outgoing swimmer detects the incoming swimmer’s
head crossing the T approximately 0.66 s later than its true point in time. Therefore,
time would be wasted when initiating the wind up related to this movement cue—
even more with reaction time to be considered. This point is further emphasized with
pool depths larger than 2 m. A simple geometrical model provided on the right side
of Figure 3 outlines this perspective issue. For an illustrative example, a pool depth of
2 m, starting block height at the front edge of 0.75 m, and an eye height of 1.5 m
above the front foot in the single step start position (corresponding to an approximate
body height of 1.8 m) was assumed. Here, from the theorem of intersecting lines
and through trigonometric functions, the outgoing swimmer detects the incoming
swimmer’s head crossing the T at 1.06 m ahead of the wall contact. In fact, this
distance is slightly longer due to the light refraction illusion. Moreover, while these
results depend on a pool depth of 2 m, for an Olympic pool depth of 3m, the outgoing
swimmer would detect the incoming swimmer’s head crossing the T as late as
0.86 m ahead of the wall contact as compared to 1.06 m for a 2 m pool depth.
Therefore, the time between the head crossing the T from a frontal perspective until
wall contact would be even shorter for 3-m pool depth.
As a further problem, relay start techniques have changed over the past two decades
(see Maglischo, 2003, 281). At present, four different alternatives are observed in
international events (parallel start with circular arm swing, track start, single step
start, and double-step start; see study 3 in this paper). In order to find a well suited
movement cue in the approach of the incoming swimmer, movement times for the
different relay start techniques must be considered. For the incoming swimmer’s
head crossing the T from a frontal perspective, the time to wall contact was found to
be approximately 0.70 s. Considering reaction time as well, the kick start movement
time would match. Here, Barlow et al. (2014) have measured 0.50 s for the front-
weighted kick-start, 0.56 s for the rear-weighted kick-start, and 0.52 s for an
intermediate version. Given that single-step and double-step starts show longer
movement times than the kick-start, false starts would be likely for single-step and
double-step starters to use the head crossing the T from a frontal perspective as a
movement cue to initiate the take-off.
In conclusion, based on our pilot study, swimmers may use the hand emersion in
the arm stroke as an appropriate movement cue for the initiation of their windup.
However, care should be taken when generalizing Maglischo’s movement cue
to male and female swimmers equally, as the length for the last arm stroke may
vary from race to race. Another point deserves notice. At present, it is unclear
whether Maglischo’s suggestion is applicable to relay start techniques other than
the traditional parallel start with circular arm movement, as different movement
structures with different movement times must be assumed. In this regard, a third
study was conducted to evaluate the use of different relay start techniques in the
London 2012 Olympic Games based on TV coverage.

Study 3: Relay Start Techniques in International Swimming
Championships
From the publicly available TV material of the London 2012 Olympic Games,
a total of 113 different male and female relay starters could be identified and
analyzed according their relay start technique. The corresponding movement times
were analyzed with true Simi Motion software (Version 8.0). The evaluated relay
events included 100 m freestyle, 200 m freestyle, and 100 m medley races. In the
case of multiple appearances, relay starts were included in the descriptive data
evaluation according to their meaning (finals > semi-finals > heats). For multiple
final appearances, the relay start with the better ranking was used. Table 2 shows
the block times for the relay starters analyzed. A total of 113 different relay starters
using four different starting techniques (parallel start with circular am swing, track
start, single-step start, and double-step start) were analyzed. For the difference
between these starting techniques regarding relay start performance, see McLean
and colleagues (McLean et al., 2000).

with different relay start techniques during the London 2012 Olympic Games.

Total 0.82 ± 0.21 0.88 ± 0.14 0.85 ± 0.19

From Table 2, relay starts with a track-start setup showed clearly shorter block times
than the other relay start techniques. In this regard, a highly significant F-value was
detected in the Oneway analysis of variance. Moreover, the single-step start appears
to be the preferred relay start technique as used by more than half of all relay starters
analyzed.
For the single step start, four of five swimmers performed a circular 360-degree
arm swing technique. The remaining swimmers did not show a circular arm swing

Introduction
Swimming starts are divided into individual (ventral and backstroke events)
and relay changeover (second, third, and fourth swimmers) techniques and
respective variants (Vilas-Boas and Fernandes, 2003). Recently, interest in
backstroke start technique research has begun to accelerate (de Jesus et
al., 2014a), which may be to the ongoing modifications in swimming rules
and facilities (Vantorre et al., 2014). From the 1960s to the beginning of
2005, the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA) determined that
backstrokers should perform their starts with both hands on grips and feet
totally immersed, restricting the number of start variants developed over
the years (e.g. Miller et al., 1984). In July 2005, FINA authorized swimmers
to position their feet above water level. Nowadays many backstrokers have
chosen a start variant with feet partially or entirely submerged (Nguyen et al.,
2014). During the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, a starting block composed
of three-backstroke start handgrips (two horizontal and one vertical) (OSB9,
Swiss Timing Ltd., Switzerland) was implemented, and variance in their use
was analyzed at that time (de Jesus et al., 2014a).
As compared to ventral start techniques, the backstroke start poses different
problems since swimmers begin the race close to the water level (Takeda et al.,
2014). In fact, in backstroke start, swimmers have to assume an extremely crouched
set-up position followed by take-off usually from an angle smaller than 45º between
the CM-COP line and the horizontal axis (Mourão et al., 2015). This main difference
implies that a flight and water entry with low resistance forces become critical
features of a good backstroke swimming start (de Jesus et al., 2013; Takeda et al.,
2014), which seems to be prioritized by FINA rule changes (de Jesus et al., 2014b;
Nguyen et al., 2014; Takeda et al., 2014). Permitting swimmers to position their feet

above the water might be beneficial for faster start times, as smaller portions of the
body in contact with the water will reduce water resistance during push off from
the wall (Hooper, 1981). However, the handgrips position adopted can affect start
performance (Itoi et al., 2010) and should be chosen based on the feet position.
For a complete understanding of backstroke start actions, researchers have
implemented a sophisticated biomechanical measurement system to describe
and / or compare muscle activation, external forces, and motion geometry between
backstroke start variants (de Jesus et al., 2015).
Detailed biomechanical analyses can provide coaches with tools to improve physical
condition, movement technique, and the interaction between swimmers and
starting block facilities (Li, 2012). Due to a shortage of studies addressing issues
related to the backstroke start, researchers and coaches are in need of summary
reports highlighting the most relevant findings. This report aims to provide an
overview of our current understanding of backstroke start technique performed
until the implementation of the new wedge in international competitions by a FINA
authorization in 2013.
Methods
Review of the backstroke start literature from 1960s until 2015
A literature search was conducted using PubMed, SportDiscus™, Scopus and
ISI Web of Knowledge electronic databases. Only documents written in English
on backstroke starts without the new edge were analyzed. Key words including
“swimming,” “backstroke,” and “start” were used to locate documents. Aside
from electronic databases, reference lists in the articles were used as well. In
addition, searches were carried out in the Proceedings of Scientific Conferences as
Biomechanics and Medicine in Swimming, the Annual Meeting of the International
Society of Biomechanics in Sports, and the International Society of Biomechanics
from 1980 to 2014. All documents included referred to experimental studies with
able swimmers.
Results and Discussion
The studies for our literature review were published between 1960 and 2015
analyzing FINA backstroke starts and corresponding biomechanical parameters
(Table 1). From the 18 studies included, six have analyzed the backstroke start
performed during competition (Ikuta et al., 2001), improving research validity. In
general terms, field study data typically provide high validity but restricted accuracy

and reliability (Schwameder, 2008). In those studies, authors emphasized the idea
that a short start time is the prerequisite for Olympic short distance events (Arellano
et al., 2001). In addition, this parameter is highly associated with underwater
distance and velocity (Cossor and Mason, 2001). Furthermore, it was suggested that
200 m backstrokers should also focus on efficient backstroke starts as compared
to 50 m and 100 m backstroke swimmers (Miller et al., 1984). This suggestion was
justified by the strong differences that have separated swimmers in elite events (e.g.
men’s 200 m backstroke: Kazan 2015 Swimming World Championships).
Aside from competition analyses, controlled studies with elite swimmers have
detailed various biomechanical approaches (such as upper and lower limb kinetics) to
describe backstroke start technique and correspond with most of them focusing on
kinematic data evaluation. In this regard, Wilson and Howard (1983) were among the
first researchers to analyze the backstroke start reporting inter- and intraindividual
joint angle variability at backstroke start set-up position in elite swimmers.
This result was explained by the strategy adopted to reduce hands-off time, improve
impulse, and flight trajectory (Theut and Jensen, 2006). Swimmers assuming a more
backward torso position are thought to be able to achieve an early hip joint extension
for a proper back arc angle (Takeda et al., 2014). In addition, they are able to generate
greater lower limb impulses (de Jesus et al., 2011a), mainly due to the second peak
in the resultant peak force (see Figure 1 below).

peak in the resultant force is indicated by a red dotted circle (Hohmann et al.,2008;
Nguyen et al., 2014).
The different types of backstroke start set-up positions have expanded since FINA
rule changes for feet position and the implementation of different hand grips (de
Jesus et al., 2014b). Studies have revealed that positioning the feet above the water’s
surface can provide faster start times depending on greater hip angles and horizontal
take-off velocity (Nguyen et al., 2014). In fact, most of the elite backstrokers have
adopted a start variant with feet partially above water level and hands on the highest
horizontal and vertical hand grip regardless of gender, expertise, and swimming
distance (de Jesus et al., 2014b). This finding has been supported by the similarities
noticed in joint angles, phase time, 15-m start time, and muscle activation (de
Jesus et al., 2015). In addition, previous studies have shown as well that backstroke
specialists adopt a larger displacement between the feet as compared to non-
specialists (Takeda et al., 2014).
Practical Conclusions and Recommendations for Coaches
Common suggestions for coaches have emerged from previous backstroke start
related studies: feet above water level seem to be the most advantageous set-up
position; however, upper limbs’ resistance training should be employed to sustain
a high CM pathway out of the water; CM high out of the water, near to the wall,

and torso leaned backward might be beneficial for efficient start performance; early
initiation of the extension and maintenance of greater hip joint angular velocity might
produce a suitable back arc angle and a hole-entry; and greater underwater distance
and velocity maintenance mainly at moments before the beginning of the arm action
might improve start time.
Coaches should implement a training program focusing on improvements of each
aerial start phase prior to underwater swimming movements, since propulsion out of
the wall prepares the following phases.

the new BaCkStroke Start wedge

and João Paulo Vilas-Boas, University of Porto
Introduction
During the Beijing Olympic Games, a starting block composed of three backstroke
start handgrips (two horizontal and one vertical) (OSB9, Swiss Timing Ltd.,
Switzerland) was implemented for the first time with several possible ways of
utilization observed at that time.
In 2014, de Jesus and co-authors (de Jesus et al, 2014a, 2014b) analyzed the various
ways of usage and the corresponding number of swimmers. The results showed
that approximately 40 percent of the backstroke swimmers in the 2012 London
Olympic Games and 2013 Barcelona Swimming World Championships had used
start variants with feet partially submerged and hands on the highest horizontal and
vertical handgrips.
Two years ago, the Fédération Internationale de Natation (FINA) approved a new
wedge for feet support (FR 2.10), which could be used in five different heights
towards the water level. Based on the changes in the FINA regulations, backstrokers
have been able to use at least three hand and five foot positions, indicating a need for
a deeper biomechanical understanding on the various advantages of each backstroke
start variant. To date, only two researchers have published findings considering the
effects of the current backstroke start wedge on performance, contrary to what has
been thoroughly observed in ventral starts (Fischer & Kibele, 2016).
Due to the recent FINA rule changes, modified swim start techniques have evolved
and new studies were conducted. In addition, sports engineers have developed new
instrumented starting blocks with force sensors ready to capture swimmers’ ground
reaction forces applied during the wall-block phase (Slawson et al., 2013). As the
starting phases are considered interdependent (Guimarães and Hay, 1985; Fischer

& Kibele, 2016), a methodology optimization must be extended to achieve the flight,
entry, and underwater phase analyses separately. The aim of this report is to describe
the main results of two studies on the recent modifications of the backstroke start.
Methods
Participants
In the first study, 10 trained male backstroke swimmers (mean ± sd: age 21.1 ± 5.36
yrs., height 1.78 ± 0.04 m, body mass 72.82 ± 10.05 kg, training background 12.6
± 6.13 yrs., and mean performance for the 100 m backstroke in 25 m pool of 59.67
± 2.89 s representing 78.67 ± 3.63% of the 100 m backstroke short course world
record) were included in the study. In the second study, 14 male and two female
high-level swimmers (mean ± sd: age: 20 ± 3 years, height: 1.85 ± 0.09 m, body
mass: 74 ± 11 kg, mean performance: 767 ± 88 FINA points) were analyzed.
Backstroke Start Variants
In study 1, two backstroke start variants were analyzed, both with feet over a
wedge (0.04 m above water level, FINA rule FR 2.10) and hands on the highest
horizontal and vertical handgrip (de Jesus et al., 2015). In study 2, the backstroke
start techniques were analyzed, with feet over the wedge with and without handgrip
initial preload. Further details about handgrip configuration and wedge position were
not instructed.
Data Collection
For study 1, a bi-dimensional (2D) kinematical analysis was employed using two
stationary cameras (HDR CX160E, Sony Electronics Inc., Japan), operating at 50
Hz sampling rate with 1/250 s exposure time (de Jesus et al., 2015). Surface and
underwater cameras were aligned and located 0.15 m above and 0.20 m below
water level, respectively. A prism (4 m horizontal length—2.5 m vertical height—
and 2 m lateral width—axes) was used for calibration. To enable swimmers’
tracking, 13 anatomical landmarks were identified (cf. de Jesus et al., 2011). For
study 2, an analysis system with four cameras (three underwater, one above) and
an instrumented starting block with two force plates and instrumented handgrips
(PAS-S, Kistler Instrumente AG, Winterthur) were used.
Data Analysis
In study 1, body segment data were manually digitized using APAS (Ariel
Performance Analysis System, Ariel Dynamics Inc. USA) in regard to the following
backstroke start phases: 1, hands-off phase: starting signal to swimmers’ hands
completely off the handgrips; 2, take-off phase: hands-off point in time to swimmers’
feet completely off the wall; 3, flight phase: take-off point in time to swimmers’ CM

CM immersion; and 4, entry phase: CM immersion to foot immersion (Figure 1).
In study 2, force data were processed with MATLAB (MathWorks Inc., USA).
Figure 1. The starting phases were
determined based on horizontal (top
graph) and vertical (lower graph) center
of mass velocity profile: the starting
signal, swimmer's hands-off, swimmer's
feet take off, swimmer’s fingertip water
contact, swimmer's full body immersion,
and beginning of lower limbs' propulsive
movements.
Results and Discussion
A new wedge has been introduced in international events through a recent FINA (FR
2.10) regulation. Therefore, researchers are challenged to help coaches and
swimmers to find effective ways to utilize this new backstroke start device. It offers
biomechanical advantages for backstroke starters that have been demonstrated
previously by the use of wall gutters during the swimming events of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) (cf. de Jesus et al., 2014a). The new wedge
offers additional friction at the wall to enhance the vertical force component. The
advantage of a new backstroke start device relates to the vertical CM displacement
and a clear water immersion. Both backstroke start determinants have been previously
mentioned in swimming science books (e.g. Maglischo et al., 2003) and peer-
reviewed papers (e.g. Takeda et al., 2014).
Findings in study 1 partially corroborate
earlier assumptions that the wedge would
improve overall backstroke start
performance. In fact, some biomechanical
advantages have been observed when
using the wedge and hands positioned
on the vertical handgrips. In particular,
larger take-off angles, vertical center off
mass positioning prior to the flight phase,
and vertical center of mass velocity at Figure 2. Kinematic advantages provided by the
CM water immersion were assumed new backstroke start wedge. (continued)

Figure 2 (continued). Kinematic advantages provided by the new backstroke start wedge.
These researchers have shown that the above mentioned advantages did not evolve
in a better 5-m swim start time as compared to backstroke starts without a wedge.
The reason for this observation may be related to an inappropriate lower-limb water
immersion strategy in conjunction with hampering a small entry hole.
The findings of study 1 showed that, following a proper steering position, swimmers
adopted an almost proximal-to-distal lower limb joint extension (de Jesus et al.,
2011). Here, the hip joint extension was followed by the simultaneous knee and
ankle joint extension (Figure 3).

Contrary to the results in study 1, study 2 showed that the new wedge has provided
biomechanical advantages in more critical instants and phases (e.g., Sinistaj et al.,
2015). These advantages appear to depend on a large pre-stretch of the upper
limbs in the horizontal direction corresponding to previous assumptions regarding
the proximity of the center of mass (CM) to the wall (de Jesus et al., 2011). However,
a CM close to the wall should not be enforced by an upright torso position but lower
limb joint angles to enable effective muscular activation for an explosive take-off
from the wall.
In study 2, swimmers showed a longer flight trajectory, a smaller entry hole, a deeper
underwater position, and shorter 15-m start times. These results differed from
study 1, which is probably due to different performance levels and familiarization
times with the new device. In fact, swimmers in study 1 familiarized themselves
with the new wedge during the warm-up prior to the experimental test. In contrast,
subjects in study 2 were familiar with the device from previous trials which, all in all,
might have influenced the results. As changes in a movement technique are harder
to achieve by experienced athletes, coaches and biomechanics should be careful
when introducing the new wedge during training sessions, allowing extensive time
for swimmers to become accustomed with the new device.
For the kinetic data analysis in study 2, horizontal- and vertical-force curve profiles
were evaluated for the upper and lower limbs separately. The horizontal- and
vertical-force components are most important for the take-off from the block. In
addition, lateral forces were analyzed as well to examine the swimmers' take-off
control strategies (Figure 3). The horizontal and vertical forces from the upper and
lower limbs were evaluated in previous studies already (e.g., de Jesus et al., 2013). In
this regard, it was revealed that swimmers use a combination of active and passive
force generation to achieve a powerful take-off from the block (Mourão et al., 2015).
Such important insights provide a basis for new training strategies for coaches and
swimmers. Therefore, a comparative analysis incorporating data when using the new
wedge would bring about additional knowledge in new backstroke start techniques.

Larger horizontal and vertical upper limb peak forces are exerted when using the
new wedge. This result might be due to a different CM position adopted with the
new device. Swimmers feel safe and more comfortable without suffering from
slippery constraints at the wall. Instead, swimmers may raise their bodies much
further beyond the water's surface. As a result, larger upper-limb forces are possible.
The upper limbs in the backstroke start are not considered the main means for a
powerful take-off. Instead, their role is to maintain the body out of the water, to guide
take-off, and consequently, to initiate the flight trajectory (de Jesus et al., 2011).
However, further studies are needed to clarify the influence of the upper limbs'
force-generating capacity for the flight trajectory (i.e. upward or lateral) when using
the wedge.
Conclusion
The new backstroke start wedge revealed biomechanical advantages during
hands-off, take-off, flight, entry, and the underwater phases in combination with
the vertical handgrip position. Furthermore, 15-m start time was improved with
swimmers adopting a near to proximal lower-limb joint extension strategy for take-
off. Additional research is needed to analyze the effects of different wedge heights
and handgrip positions on backstroke start performance.
Practical Applications
For Performance
A proper understanding of the backstroke start with the new wedge in various
settings may help coaches to individually determine (i.e. 0.04 m above or below
water level and at water level with hands vertically or horizontally positioned) the
best option for their swimmers' backstroke start performances.
After an appropriate familiarization period, researchers have identified clear
advantages of the new wedge throughout the aerial and in-water backstroke start
phases.
For Training
Knowledge of the biomechanical requirements for the different backstroke start
variants using the new wedge may help coaches to develop training programs to
enhance the underlying biomechanical strategies. It is expected that a large amount
of training with the new wedge is necessary to improve the swimmers' backstroke

start performances. In this regard, biomechanical testing provides a means to identify
the biomechanical parameters which have been improved, maintained, or decreased
through training sessions. In addition, biomechanical testing can be used to show
correspondences between the swimmers' technical profiles and their optimal swim
start performances.

Introduction
During the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, a starting block composed of three
backstroke start handgrips (i.e. two horizontal and one vertical) (OSB9, Swiss Timing
Ltd., Switzerland) was implemented. The various forms of usage were already known
at that time.
The swimming start is the first technical element that swimmers carry out in a race.
It has been determined as the element where swimmers achieve the highest average
horizontal velocity of a race (Kennedy et al, 1990; Nelson et al., 1992; Mason et al.,
2000). Its duration is relatively short, between 5 and 8 seconds when related to the
15-m distance. However, its performance can be decisive in the final race result.
During the last World Swimming Championships held in Barcelona (2013), the start
time (15-m distance) accounted for 24.08 ± 1.10% and 24.84 ± 0.69% of the total
time in males and females, respectively, in 50-m events, and for 11.25 ± 0.59% in
males and 11.78 ± 0.55% in females in 100-m events (Argüelles-Cienfuegos & De
La Fuente-Caynzos, 2014).
Until 2009, the most common starting techniques used in freestyle, butterfly,
and breaststroke competition events were the grab start (GS), characterized by
a parallel-feet position at the front edge of the starting block; and the track start
(TS), characterized by a non-parallel position, where one foot is placed at the front
edge of the starting block and the other is displaced towards the rear end. In 2009,
FINA (International Swimming Federation) approved the use of a new starting block
(OSB11, Swiss Timing Ltd., Switzerland) that features an “adjustable and slanted
footrest” (FR.2.7. Starting platforms in FINA's rules). This element represented an
improvement for the swimming starts because swimmers could adopt a similar
starting position as the TS but with a stable and adjustable surface where to place

their rear foot. As a consequence of this new starting block, a new start technique
evolved. The literature defines this start as the kick-start (KS).
Until the introduction of the OSB11, the majority of research in the field of
swimming starts aimed to find the technique most beneficial for swimming start
performance. At that time, studies presented inconclusive results comparing GS
and TS performance. As a conclusion, some authors did not give any priority to the
use of one technique over the other. Accordingly, the best starting technique was
assumed to be the one most practiced by the swimmer (Blanksby et al., 2002; Mason
et al., 2007; Jorgić et al., 2010; Vantorre et al., 2010; Thanopoulos et al., 2012). In
contrast, some investigations gave preference to TS (Holthe & McLean, 2001; Issurin
& Verbitsky, 2002), while some others considered the opposite (Ayalon et al., 1975;
Zatsiorsky et al., 1979; Counsilman et al., 1986; Krüger et al., 2003).
After the introduction of the KS, authors concluded the GS and the TS were less
beneficial for the swimming start performance concerning larger take-off velocities,
shorter block times, flight times, and times to 5, 7.5, 10 and 15 m (Nomura et al.,
2010; Beretić et al., 2012; Honda et al., 2012; Ozeki et al., 2012). This superiority
for KS over TS, as well as the decline in GS popularity in the last years’ competitions,
has ended the discussion on the best swimming start technique. To our knowledge,
only one research determined advantages for KS in the horizontal velocity and time
to 7.5 m in comparison with GS (Biel et al., 2010).
Nowadays, the KS is the most popular technique in international competitions.
Consequently, investigations are focused on its improvement by evaluating the
advantages of the back plate (Nomura et al., 2010; Beretić et al., 2012; Ozeki et
al., 2012) as well as its correct or optimal position and the swimmer’s perfect body
position when using the back plate starting block (Cousin & Dyson, 2004; Hardt et
al., 2009; Honda et al., 2012; Honda et al., 2010; Ozeki et al., 2012; Slawson et al.,
2012). However, it is interesting to note that despite previous studies emphasizing
the importance of the angular momentum in techniques with an asymmetrical
starting position (McLean et al., 2010; Vantorre et al., 2011), there are hardly any
studies that included this variable when analyzing the KS.
Because of a lack of studies comparing KS and GS and analyzing the angular
momentum in KS, two different studies were conducted with the following goals:
to determine the advantages of the kinematic, angular, and temporal parameters
of the KS over the GS; and to analyze the development of the normalized angular
momentum about the mediolateral body axis during swim starts from an OSB11
starting block in order to identify different take-off strategies, as well as to examine
their effects on the performance in the different phases of the swim start.

Grab Start Vs Kick-Start: Differences and Similarities
In order to carry out the first objective, a sample of nine elite swimmers from the
Spanish National Team (body mass 70.0 ± 7.7 kg; height 178 ± 9.4 cm; age 24.5
± 5.3 years; and FINA Points Score 824 points) was analyzed. Each swimmer
performed between six and 10 swim start trials in a counterbalanced order (GS and
KS) from a starting block OMEGA OSB11. The trial with the best performance at
5 m was included in the statistical analysis. Each trial was filmed by five cameras:
four Nikon 1 J1 high-definition cameras and one underwater camera (Sony HDR-
AS15), equally positioned up to 5-m distance (frame rate of 60 Hz, a resolution
of 1280x720, shutter speed of 1/1000 s). Kwon 3D XP software was used for
the manual digitalization of 21 anthropometrical points (de Leva, 1996) and the
subsequent kinematical analysis.
Characteristics of the Body Position for the Grab Start and Kick-Start
Two different angular parameters were analyzed in order to determine the differences
between GS and KS concerning the body position in three different points in time:
starting position at rest, take-off, and hands entry. As a first parameter, the shoulder
angle—defined as the angle between the hip, shoulder, and elbow—was assessed.
Second, the hip angle was calculated as the angle between the hip, shoulder, and
knee. For the KS, the hip angle was divided into the rear-leg hip angle and front-leg
hip angle. For the GS, the hip angle was measured as the average between the right-
leg angle and the left-leg angle. In addition, the height of the center of mass (CoM),
defined as the vertical distance above the water line, was also measured in the three
moments of the start.
Table 1 shows the means, standard deviations, and significant p-values for each
angular variable analyzed, as well as for the height of the CoM in the three moments
during the start. Contrary to expectations, we did not find significant differences
at starting position in the CM height, the hip, or the shoulder angle. Similarly, it
was surprising to find that at take-off and at hands entry, the differences were
only noticeable with respect to the rear-leg hip angle and the height of the CoM.
The results in the height of the CoM indicated that both the back plate and the
asymmetrical position had only an influence at take-off and hands entry. KS showed
a higher position of the CoM in both points in time. These results are consistent with
other studies that compared KS and TS (Beretić et al., 2012; Nomura et al., 2010;
Ozeki et al., 2012; Vilas-Boas, Cruz, Sousa, Conceição, & Carvalho, 2000).
The highest rear-leg hip angle for the KS at take-off and hands entry suggests
a higher position of the rear leg than the lower limbs for GS. The upward CM
movement produced by the rear leg from the take-off of the back plate to the toe-off
from the block caused these different positions at take-off and hands entry. Besides,
it is important to note that the differences observed in the rear leg between KS and
78

GS at hands entry (21.08°) were reduced at take-off (32.50°). These results show
that, for the KS, a lower CM flight trajectory is produced by the rear leg than in the
GS. Due to the lower leg position at the GS take-off, the swimmers need to perform
a more pronounced upward movement with the lower limbs during the flight to
provide an aligned position at the water entry.
Table 1. Differences between the GS and KS for the angular variables and height of CoM, at starting
position, take-off, and hands entry.

Height CoM 0.67 ± 0.04 0.71 ± 0.04 0.052
Finally, if we observe the differences between the rear hip and front hip angle for KS,
we can see at take-off a higher position of the rear leg with respect to the front leg
with a difference of 32.22°. However, at hands entry, these differences were reduced
to 10.16°. Furthermore, the front-hip angle increased from the take-off to the hands
entry, while the rear-hip angle remained almost with no variation. These results
suggest a front-leg movement toward the rear leg during the flight phase with the
objective of entry into the water with both legs together. Comparing this movement
with GS, we observed a lower displacement during the flight phase of the lower
limbs for GS (14.58°) than the movement of the front leg for KS (25.22°). Due to the
greater range of motion of the lower limbs in KS, we can observe higher values in the
water entry angles, which suggests a more aligned and vertical body position. These
results are in line with the research of Vantorre et al. (2010), who showed similar
differences between TS and GS. Their results indicated a greater movement of the
legs during the aerial phase of TS.

Kinematic Parameters
After analyzing the differences
produced in the horizontal displacement
(horizontal distance travelled by the
swimmers’ CoM from the starting signal
to the hands contact with the water)
between both techniques (Figure 1), we
observed that with the KS the swimmers
travelled the same distance (2.83 ±
0.29 m; 2.79 ± 0.27 m; p = 0.114; GS,
and KS, respectively) in a shorter time
(1.07 ± 0.06 s; 0.89 ± 0.06 s; p = 0.001;
GS, and KS, respectively) than with
the GS. With the purpose of finding
the reasons for this KS superiority, an
analysis of the velocity produced on the
block was made.
As expected, higher horizontal (4.05 ±
0.21 m/s; 4.12 ± 0.31 m/s; p = 0.004)
and resultant velocities (4.46 ± 0.33 m/s;
4.63 ± 0.33 m/s; p = 0.032) were found
for KS than GS. These findings are in
concordance with the ones presented
by Biel et al. (2010). In the same way,
vertical velocity also obtained higher
values for KS but with no significant
differences (-1.77 ± 0.09 m/s; -1.99 ±
0.20 m/s; p = 0.185).
Despite the significance of the
differences in the horizontal velocity, it Figure 1. Differences between GS (straight

for KS above the GS amounts to horizontal displacement, horizontal velocity, and

compared with the differences obtained (example of one subject). Circles represent the

horizontal velocity in both techniques
(Figure 1) show that the velocity increase is larger for KS than for GS; such that, at
take-off of hands, the KS provided an advantage of 0.13 s as compared to the GS.
The graphs of the horizontal acceleration (Figure 1) show the capacity of KS to
produce larger values during the initial phase of the take-off. Consequently, KS

offers an advantage over the GS prior to the hands take-off. With the KS, swimmers
were able to reach the maximum peak of acceleration previous to the hands take-
off (0.37 s). This faster production of acceleration allowed them to reduce the
block time without compromising the entry distance. In contrast, GS had a more
progressive acceleration with a peak attained at 0.67 s after the hands take-off. In
this regard, Nomura et al. (2010) argue that the back plate facilitates larger horizontal
accelerations before leaving the block. Accordingly, the differences in the force vector
direction due to the differences in the feet positioning on the block may explain the
observed increase in the acceleration for KS above GS.
Analysis of the Temporal Parameters
In this study, five different points in time of the swimming start have been compared:
hands take-off (HTO), the time between the starting signal until the hands leave
the starting block; block time (BT), the time between the starting signal until the
swimmers leave the starting block; flight time (FT), the time between the take-off
until the hands entry; and BT + FT, the sum of the block time and the flight time.
In order to determine the performance of the aerial phase, the 5-m time (T5) was
calculated. This value is defined as the time elapsed from the starting signal until the
head crosses an imaginary line at 5 m.
Table 2. Mean, standard deviation, p-value, and temporal differences between GS and
KS in each swim start moment defined.
GS KS p-value Differences
HTO - Hands take-off (s) 0.51 ± 0.04 0.38 ± 0.07 0.001 0.13
BT - Block time (s) 0.83 ± 0.07 0.66 ± 0.59 0.001 0.17
FT - Flight time (s) 0.24 ± 0.05 0.22 ± 0.49 0.056 0.02
BT + FT (s) 1.07 ± 0.06 0.89 ± 0.06 0.001 0.18
Time to 5 m (s) 1.71 ± 0.13 1.56 ± 0.15 0.001 0.15
As expected and in agreement with Biel et al. (2010), t-tests showed significantly
shorter differences in all temporal variables for KS except for the FT (Table 2).
Differences produced between both techniques for each phase of the swimming
start indicate the block phase as the most relevant for the take-off and aerial
performance. The main advantages between both techniques are obtained for
HTO and BT. However, after the take-off from the block, the swimmers practically
maintained temporal differences until the 5-m mark. Previous studies comparing TS
to GS failed to show differences other than those related to the take-off performance
on the block (Vilas-Boas et al., 2003; Vint et al., 2009; Welcher et al., 2008). We

associate the advantages of the KS obtained on the block to the above reported
differences in the horizontal velocity and acceleration.
Angular Momentum in the Kick Start
For this issue, a study was conducted with 36 elite swimmers from the Spanish
and German National Teams (height: 1.82 ± 0.09 m; mass: 76.89 ± 10.23 kg; age:
25.03 ± 3.07 years; and FINA points: 685 ± 140 points). The goal of the study
was to analyze the development of the normalized angular momentum about the
mediolateral body axis during a swim start from an OSB11 starting block. Two
different testing sessions (one each for the Spanish and German National Teams)
were carried out to obtain video footage of the KS with the swimmers’ preferred
starting posture. Prior to each swim start, individual warm-up programs were
performed. For all of the testing trials, the swimmers were instructed to perform
their starts with maximal effort to 15 m beyond the starting block. The trial with the
best performance at 5 m was used for the statistical data analysis. In this respect,
the time to 5 m was considered to represent a performance estimate for the block
phase and the flight phase that excluded underwater undulatory movement. The
swim starts were initiated by an acoustic signal linked to a flashlight to allow them
to be captured on video.
Five high-definition cameras (frame rate of 60 Hz, resolution of 1280 x 720, and a
shutter speed of 1/1000 s) were used to record the Spanish swimmers’ trials. Four
of the cameras (Nikon 1 J1) were positioned on both sides of the swimming pool at
a distance of 7.50 m from the swimming lane and parallel to the swim direction. The
cameras’ distances from the front edge of the starting block were 2.80 m and 10 m.
The fifth camera (Sony HDR-AS15) was positioned underwater to capture the time
between the starting signal and the head passing 5 m. A rectangular grid (2 m x
1.55 m x 0.81 m) with 34 control points was used to calibrate the plane of motion on
the block. The accuracy of the grid coordinates was less than 0.78 mm for each of the
above-water cameras. For the center of mass (CoM) kinematics, an anthropometric
model with 21 points based on de Leva (1996) was used. Kwon 3D XP software was
used for digitalization and further kinematic analysis.
For the German National Team’s testing session, two video cameras (Sony DCR-
TRV900E Pal recording at 50 Hz) were placed at a height of 1.35 m above the water
and horizontal to the front edge of the block. The cameras were positioned 0 m and
5 m beyond the block to capture the swimmers’ behaviour on the block and the time
between the starting signal and the swimmers’ heads passing 5 m. A 2D structure
(2 m x 2 m) was used to calibrate the plane of motion on the b. The anthropometric
model defined by de Leva (1996) was used with one alteration: Eleven anatomical

landmarks were manually digitalized on the right side, while on the left side, only five
points were defined. In all, 15 points were used for the CoM kinematics: the middle
of the ear, shoulder, elbow, wrist, fingertip, hip, knee, ankle, heel, and big toe on the
right side; and the hip, knee, ankle, heel, and bigtoe on the left side. A Simi Motion
video analysis system (Simi Motion, v 8.0, Germany) was used for digitalization and
further kinematic analysis.
Characteristics of Angular Momentum on the Block
A cluster analysis using the squared Euclidean distances identified four different
profiles in the development of angular momentum (Figure 2). Each cluster was
defined based on two main features: the way that angular momentum decreases
before the hands take off, and the magnitude of the angular momentum obtained at
take-off. Related to the first feature, we found that cluster 1 (eight males and two
females) was characterized by a decrease of angular momentum before the hands
take-off attaining values of 0.00 ± 0.01 s-1 × 10-3. Cluster 2 (seven males and six
females) also showed a decrease of angular momentum prior to hands take-off,
but lower than the cluster 1 with values after the hands take-off of 0.01 ± 0.01 s-1
× 10-3. Cluster 3 (five males and one female) was characterized by a progressive
increase of angular momentum from the starting signal until take-off. And, cluster
4 (four males and three females), presented a slow increase of angular momentum
before the hands take-off and a faster increase after this point in time. The angular
momentum at take-off found to be 0.10 ± 0.02 s-1 × 10-3 (cluster 1), 0.11 ± 0.01 s-1
× 10-3 (cluster 2), 0.09 ± 0.01 s-1 × 10-3 (cluster 3), and 0.13 ± 0.01 s-1 × 10-3 (cluster
4). When applying the Bonferroni’s post-hoc test, we found significant differences
between cluster 4 and cluster 1 (p < 0.001), cluster 2 (p = 0.016), and cluster 3
(p < 0.001).

An analysis of the swimmers’ body positions on the block was carried out with the
aim to determine the causes of the different angular momentum strategies. Results
showed that the differences in the angular momentum development were due
to differences in the front knee angle (angle between ankle, knee, and hip of the
front leg for KS and the corresponding average value for the left and right leg for
GS) at starting position and the upper limbs’ displacement during the block phase.
Clusters with higher take-off angular momentum presented larger front knee angles
(cluster 1, 125.60 ± 8.27°; cluster 2, 124.64 ± 11.40°; cluster 3, 120.36 ± 14.82°; and
cluster 4, 138.64 ± 16.27°). Correspondingly, clusters with larger take-off angular
momentum were associated with a smaller displacement of the arms during the
block phase. Here, cluster 1 and cluster 3 are both characterized by small values of
angular momentum at take-off, indicating different displacements of the upper limbs
compared to cluster 2 and cluster 4, showing a larger angular momentum at take-
off. Cluster 3 presented a forward displacement of the upper limbs during the block
phase and a backward-forward movement of the arms that limited the production
of angular momentum compared to cluster 1. In contrast, clusters 2 and 4 were
characterized by a more proximal positioning of the arms to the torso maintaining
a parallel position of the upper limbs on the block. Following Vantorre and his
coworkers’ argument, a closer position of the arms to the body would accelerate
the body’s forward rotation, and consequently increase the angular momentum
(Vantorre et al., 2010).
Finally, cluster 4, characterized by the largest angular momentum at take-off, showed
a faster entry than cluster 1 (1.01 ± 0.11; 0.88 ± 0.041; p = 0.027), a shorter time to
5 m (1.61 ± 0.13; 1.52 ± 0.16; p = 0.007; cluster 1 and cluster 4 respectively), as well
as smaller entry distance (2.88 ± 0.16; 2.02 ± 0.67; p = 0.012; cluster 1 and cluster
4 respectively). In addition, differences toward cluster 2 were also found in the time
to 5 m (1.65 ± 0.13 vs 1.52 ± 0.16; p = 0.023 in cluster 2 vs cluster 4). Moreover, it
is important to note that a similar time to 5 m as well as higher horizontal take-off
velocity and entry distance was observed for cluster 3 compared to cluster 4, where
larger values of angular momentum at take-off were found. However, as different
distributions of male and female subjects were found in these clusters, a gender
effect must be considered.
Further studies are needed to examine the different types of water entry dependent
on the development of angular momentum on the block (Figure 2). Previous studies
indicate that a smaller angular momentum on the block generates a more horizontal
entry (flat dive), while a larger angular momentum leads to a more vertical entry (pike
dive) (Vantorre et al., 2010). Pike dives enable swimmers to gain larger entry depths,
which imply lower hydrodynamic resistance as well as smaller decrements in speed
and, therefore, improved underwater performance (Elipot et al., 2009; Holthe &
McLean, 2001; Miller et al., 2002). Hence, an optimization of the angular momentum

during take-off and its consequence for the water entry seems to be an important
factor to improve the swimming start performance.
Figure 3. Different strategies at water entry.
Conclusion
(1) The superiority of the KS above the GS is related to its capacity to quickly
increase the horizontal velocity and the horizontal acceleration. A faster increase
of both parameters is confounded with other advantages prior to the take-off,
as well as maintaining these advantages until the 5 m distance. Moreover, the
upward movement of the rear leg on the block and the displacement of the front
leg towards the rear leg during the flight phase enable the simmer to enter the
water with a more aligned body position.
(2) A larger front leg knee angle and a closer alignment of the arms to the torso for
KS are required to increase the angular momentum at take-off. As a result, larger
body rotations are produced during the flight phase, such that the swimmers are
able to obtain an optimal water entry.

Chapter 8:
poStaCtiVation potentiation in Sprint Swimming
Francisco Cuenca-Fernández, University of Granada, Spain
In collaboration with Raúl Arellano, University of Granada, Spain
Introduction
In swimming events, warm-up (WU) protocols are common prior to the race.
These are usually performed several minutes ahead of the start to prepare the
muscular system for the subsequent task (Balilionis et al., 2012; Bishop, 2003a;
Bishop, 2003b; McMorris et al., Kelly, 2006; Perrier et al., 2011). However, so far,
studies carried out on sprint swimming have failed to show a clear structure of
the WU (Balilionis et al., 2012; Neiva et al., 2014). For the WU to be not intense
enough, the swimmer would start the race without all his capacities activated.
For the WU to be too strenuous, fatigue could develop, deteriorating subsequent
muscle contractions. In addition, lengthy WU would condition the swimmer to
an aerobic state or even to an inappropriate swimming technique. Both cases
would be inadequate for the proper preparation of a race (Neiva et al., 2014).
Finally, if the time between warm-up and competition is not properly controlled
and the swimmer does not have enough time to recover from the WU, a negative
influence on the performance would evolve similarly to the time of rest being too
long (Neiva et al., 2013; West et al., 2011; Zochowski et al., 2007). Therefore, it
remains open how WU protocols should be structured. The study presented here
refers to the WU for sprint swimming. Here, the loss or gain of one second could
mean winning or losing a race. As compared to longer distance events, acyclical
phases, such as swimming starts, turns, and undulatory swimming (Arellano,
2010) to be performed at maximum intensity and in the best conditions possible
(Burkett et al., 2010) are of particular importance in sprint swimming.
In the literature, high power and speed have been identified to be key WU components
for sprint events (Sharp et al., 1982). However, conducting WU exercises in the
water may not provide a sufficient stimulus for the neuromuscular system to prepare
for competition. Therefore, an easy and reliable dryland method is needed to provide
a stronger neuromuscular stimulus in the WU for sprint swimming. Here is when the
use of Postactivation Potentiation (PAP) may be considered.
PAP improves muscle contractility, strength, and speed in sporting performances
by applying maximal or submaximal loads on the muscle before the performance.

The effects observed when applying PAP refer to a physiological adaptation that
renders actin-myosin structures in the myofibrils to be more sensitive to the Ca2+
release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum on one hand and an increase in muscle fiber
recruitment due to an increase of the motor neuron excitability on the other. Taken
together, these effects produce an amplification of the muscle action potential which
enhances the mechanical power and, consequently, the athletic performance (Sale,
2004; Tillin & Bishop, 2009).
PAP in Swimming Start Performance
In swimming, a fast start (time to 15 m) is important for competitive success,
particularly in sprint events (Barlow et al., 2014; Slawson et al., 2013). The shorter
the distance of the race, the higher the impact of the swimming start on the final
result. In this respect, start times were found to range from 26.1% to 0.8% of the
overall race time for 100m- to 400m-events (Cossor & Mason, 2001). So far, fast
reaction times, large jumping power, high take-off velocities, and small drag forces
during entry were identified to be of predominant importance for the swimming start
(Beretic et al., 2012; Beretic et al., 2013; Honda et al., 2010).
In 2009, a new starting technique evolved with the introduction of an inclined “kick”
plate mounted on the newly designed OSB11 start block (Omega Timing, Corgémont,
Switzerland). The kick start is essentially a modified track start that allows the rear
foot to produce significantly larger horizontal forces when placed upon the kick plate.
This device is angled at 30° to the surface of the block and can be horizontally moved
through five different locations. As a result of the introduction of the OSB11, the kick
start has been developed and utilized by most elite swimmers during competition.
Multiple studies have found that swimmers can gain an advantage when using this
new technique (Barlow et al., 2014; Beretic et al., 2012; Honda et al., 2010; Ozeki et
al., 2012). The additional benefits are mainly due to an increase in horizontal velocity
based on increases in the rear foot horizontal force (Honda et al., 2010; Ozeki et al.,
2012; Slawson et al., 2013).
The block phase influences the performance in subsequent phases of the start
(Mason et al., 2007). Some studies have shown a relationship between lower-body
muscle force and start performance (Beretic et al., 2013; Cuenca-Fernandez et al.,
2014; Slawson et al., 2013; West et al., 2011). The results indicate a correspondence
between peak force values and rate of force development and swim start
performance (Beretic et al., 2013; West et al., 2011).
With the new OSB 11, block time is shorter than with previous starting block models
(Beretic et al., 2012; Honda et al., 2010). Further, studies indicate an advantage
for the rear-weighted starting position with an emphasis on the rear-leg strength
capacity (Barlow et al., 2014) rather than to take off from the platform as fast as
possible (Garcia-Hermoso et al., 2013; Ozeki et al., 2012). All in all, it appears
91

that a WU protocol to improve the neuromuscular activation of the leg extensors
would help to optimize the take-off performance on the block. Here is when PAP
methods may become effective. In particular, PAP stimuli need to be matched to the
requirements specific to a sport in order to be effective (Sale, 2004; Tillin & Bishop,
2009).
In the past, studies have confirmed that PAP benefits are more effective when
including a rest period between six and eight minutes following an exercise protocol
with submaximal intensity as fatigue needs to be avoided (Kilduff et al., 2011;
Ozeki et al., 2012). Further, positive results were obtained when the movement
types during exercise and competition were biomechanically similar and required
corresponding muscle activation levels (Esformes et al., 2011). Last but not least, the
fitness level must be considered when applying PAP in a WU protocol. In fact, better
results were obtained when PAP methods were applied to trained individuals with a
high proportion of fast fibers, as they are accustomed to overcome fatigue (Esformes
et al., 2011, Hamada et al., 2000; Sale, 2004; Pääsuke et al., 2007; Requena et
al., 2011). Otherwise, valid conclusions are not possible if the state of training is
unknown. This is why we used relative force (F ) as a fitness estimate in this regard.
rel
Taking these points into account, the use of the new OSB11 starting block with its
corresponding force profiles for the front and for the rear legs must be considered
when identifying the optimal activation for the PAP exercise (Arellano, 2010; Cossor
et al., 2011; Takeda et al., 2012).
To date, there are only few studies that have analyzed the swim start performance
in relation to different WU protocols. Those that exist, however, were conducted
without any specific consideration to match the muscle activation level between
WU and competition (Balilionis et al., 2012; Breed & Young, 2003; Kilduff et
al., 2011). Moreover, to the author’s knowledge, there are no studies available
regarding a specific WU protocol for swim start performance on the new OSB11
with asymmetric foot placement. Therefore, it appeared necessary to identify some
asymmetric potentiation exercises to provide a more specific and stronger stimulus
for swim starts. One of them might be the lunge exercise, which primarily activates
the hip and knee extensor muscles of the front leg (Chiu & Salem, 2004; 21) to
generate a strong impulse in track start (Galbraith et al., 2008). Further, it may prove
to be beneficial using inertial systems to be pulled, as the flywheel inertial device
YoYo Squat (YoYo™ Technology AB, Stockholm, Sweden), which may induce a
potentiation effect with a very high muscle activation as reported in EMG studies
(Chiu & Salem, 2004, McMorris et al., 2006; Mason, 2007; Neiva et al., 2013; Tillin &
Bishop, 2009). As such, flywheel inertial devices produce resistances independent of
the gravity they can be applied in any direction allowing a wide variety of exercises
(Chiu & Salem, 2004; McMorris et al., 2006). Due to the technical construction of the
device, including a belt to be pulled, a close similarity to the swim start extension
movement on the block is provided.

Methods
Experimental Approach to the Problem
Fourteen trained swimmers (10 men and four women between 17 and 23 years
of age; height 176.3 ± 9.1 cm; weight 69 ± 11.4 kg) volunteered for this study. An
intragroup design of randomized repeated measures was adopted with swimmers
performing two different WU activation protocols, followed by an assessment of
each swim start performance. A rest period of eight minutes separated the end of
WU exercise from the swim starts (SS). In the beginning of the study, as a reference
for the PAP exercises, a swim start was analyzed following a standard warm-up
(SWU) consisting of 400 m varied swimming exercises (200 m easy freestyle swim
with 2 starts from the wall; 3 x 50 m front crawl swims at different paces, 1 x 100 m
crawl normal pace) and dynamic lower limb stretching. Then, swimmers were
randomly separated into two groups. Group 1 performed at first the lunge warm-up
(LWU) activation protocol with one set of three repetitions (Figure 1, left side) at 85%
of the one-repetition maximum. Group 2 performed at first the YoYo Squat flywheel
warm-up (YWU) protocol with a set of four maximal voluntary contractions with the
YoYo Squat flywheel device (Figure 2, right side). Here, the first repetition served to
charge the flywheel mechanism.
Figure 1. PAP induction through the lunge exercise (left) and the YoYo Squat flywheel device (right).
Following a 60-minute break, group 1 completed the WU protocol with the YoYo
Squat Flywheel exercise (group 1 WU sequence: SWU – SS – LWU – SS – YWU –
SS) and group 2 with the lunge exercise (group 2 WU sequence: SWU – SS – YWU
– SS – LWU – SS).

Prior to the data collection in the WU protocols, subjects reported to the laboratory
for an introduction of the testing methods and an analysis of their muscle strength
values. For the latter, they performed a 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) for the isotonic
lunge test (mean value 68.8 ± 25.2 kg) with a Smith machine (Technogym, Spain).
They were asked to place their feet in the same position as in the swim start situation
on the block. An initial position with a 90º angle in the front and in the rear knee was
required prior to the leg extension. Afterwards, their lower limbs’ relative force values
were calculated (mean value: 0.95 ± 0.28) based on the best 1-RM trial divided by
the body weight. During this familiarization session, swimmers also practiced the
swim start type forward extension movement on the flywheel inertial device.
Variables Analyzed and Material
For the analysis of swim start performance, kinematic variables were assessed by
recording each attempt with three digital video cameras. One of them was a high-
speed camera (Casio, HS Camera 300Hz) operating at a sampling rate of 300Hz;
it was mounted on a tripod and focused perpendicular to the block. This camera
recorded the horizontal hip velocity (VxH). The two other digital video cameras
(Sony Video Camera, 50Hz) were fixed on the poolside registering the Dive Distance
(DD), and the time between the starting signal and the head passage at 5 and
15 meters (T5 m, T15 m). The block camera was focused on the starting block to
spot the light emitted by the starting signal. The starting system (Signal Frame,
Sportmetrics) simultaneously emitted an audible signal and a strobe flash. This was
used to synchronize the starting signal with the video analysis. The video sequences
of the different cameras were overlapped in space and time by a video switcher
(Digital Video Switcher SE- 900, Whittier, USA). All video files were analyzed by two
different researchers who used the software Kinovea (version 0.7.10). This software
allowed the analysis of the reference points (hip-, knee-, and ankle joints) drawn on
swimmers. For the reliability analysis of the digitizing process (intraobserver and
interobserver), 6 trials were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC)
with two different investigators digitizing three trials each. The intraobserver ICC
ranged from 0.97 to 0.99; and the interobserver ICC ranged from 0.98 to 0.99.
Statistical Analysis
After testing for the normality distribution, analysis was carried out using a repeated
measure ANOVA to determine differences within and between subjects concerning
the three protocols applied. To detect difference between protocols, significance was
accepted at the alpha < 0.05 level. Paired comparisons were used in conjunction
with Holm’s Bonferroni method for a control of the type 1 error.
Standard statistical methods were used for the calculation of means, standard
deviations (SD), and Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients to verify
the relationship between relative force and kinematic variables of the swim starts.
Analyses were performed using SPSS software version 21.0 (IBM, Chicago, IL, USA).

Results and Discussion
Earlier, an analysis of the PAP warm-up effect for swimming starts was studied
by Kilduff et al. (2013). In that study, PAP was proposed as an alternative to the
regular warm-up and they reported eight minutes of rest as an optimal recovery time
between PAP and swim starts. However, swim start variables showed no significant
improvements, possibly because the PAP stimulus was not intense enough to
cause a potentiation effect. Therefore, it was the goal of this study to evaluate the
effects of more intense PAP stimulus additions to a standard warm-up on swim
start performance (Cuenca-Fernandez et al., 2014). In order to make comparisons
possible the original rest period of eight minutes as proposed by Kilduff et al (2013)
was adopted. Because of schedule restrictions, all the protocols were performed the
same day.
Results showed that protocols that included specific PAP added to the regular
warm-up achieved better values (Table 1) than obtained after SWU.

Specifically, warm-up that included the YoYo Squat repetitions (YWU) was shown
to cause the biggest improvements on swim start performance (Table 1). Significant
differences were found in the repeated measures ANOVA analysis for the dive
distance (F = 35.9, p < 0.001) and the horizontal velocity (VxH) during flight

(F = 47.0, p < 0.001).

Swimmers were faster during flight after the YWU activation protocol compared
with the other two WU protocols (Table 1). The time to 5 m was significantly
different between the three warm-up protocols (F = 24.4, p < 0.001) with YWU

superior to the other WU procedures. In contrast, for the time to 15 m, only YWU
and SWU were significantly different (F2,12 = 4.3, p < 0.05).

Kinematic variables of the swim start were correlated with baseline F values

obtained through the lunge exercise (Table 2). Hence, individuals with stronger
lower limbs performed better in the swimming starts regardless of the WU protocol
applied. For the SWU, swimmers with higher F values in the lunge test achieved
rel
higher horizontal hip velocities during flight (R2 = 0.308, p < 0.05) in line with larger
dive distances (R2 = 0.872, p < 0.001) and reduced swim start times to the 15 m
mark (R2 = -0.813, p < 0.001).
These results are in agreement with those showed by Beretic et al. (2013) and West
et al. (2011). However, it should be kept in mind that in the study by Beretic et al.
(2013) an isometric strength test with in-parallel foot position was carried out while
subjects in the study of West et al. (2011) performed a grab start. Thus, our study
aimed to confirm these results regarding an asymmetric foot placement during the
WU protocol and the kick start on the OSB11.

When considering the changes occasioned in performance by PAP, correlations with
baseline relative force values were still maintained - or significance became even
stronger, as in the case of the horizontal hip velocity - depending on the intensity of
the warm-up applied (Table 2). Correlations were stronger in YWU when compared
to SWU and LWU. This means that individuals with a large relative forces showed
larger PAP effects in particular for the YoYo Squat.
Warm-ups based on PAP were not only effective for improving swim start
performance: A strong correspondence was found between the PAP intensity and
the swim start performance (Figure 2), which was most prominent in the stronger
individuals. Therefore, our results confirm the assumption that PAP effects depending
on a good fitness level (Tillin & Bishop, 2009) as expressed by high values of F .
rel
Current Studies and Future Perspectives
Analysis Using Force Plates
The gains obtained in swim start performance appear to originate from an improved
force production on the block. This is correspondence was further supported by an
unpublished study in thirteen swimmers receiving a PAP YoYo stimulation between
kick starts on the starting block with a six minute in-between rest period. Preliminary
results show an improvement in the post PAP trials, indicating that male swimmers
more readily respond to the PAP application than females.
PAP Control and Protocolization
At times, PAP stimuli were reported to have no effect on the subjects at all maybe
due to the wide variety of procedures applied. Therefore, it is important to find
identify a common pattern for the application of this method. One key issue could
be related to the load applied. If the load is very low, no sufficient stimulation is
provided to the muscle fibers as myosin light may not be phosphorylated (Tillin &
Bishop, 2009). If the load intensity is adequate to produce a muscular effect, the rest
period must be considered until performing the subsequent task. Insufficient rest will
cause fatigue. In contrast, for lengthy rest periods the adaptation stimulus will be
lost. Therefore, the rest administration must be suited to each athlete individually in
addition to an adequate load control. Here, the application of dynamic measurement
systems could provide the coach with useful tools. It:
• demonstrates the force/velocity/power curve and its relationship with the load,
• allows the identification of the most effective area of application for peak
performance, and
• is an easy way to control the state of training or fatigue using instantaneous
feedback.

Conclusion
• PAP improves ballistic movements and is a practical tool for coaches in order to
have greater control of the application of the stimulus.
• PAP could be relevant, especially in short events, where the differences are small
and where swimmers need to develop a high power.
• PAP is still a young method which needs much more research in order to apply
load and rest properly.

Introduction
Over the last 40 or so years, a considerable number of instrumented start and turn
swim analysis systems have been developed in various parts of the world, to assist
with the enhancement of elite swimming performances. In most instances, these
systems have been designed and developed to be utilized in primarily a specific
pool for a set clientele or for a specific purpose. In some cases, the clientele may be
a national or an elite swim club team, whereas in other cases it may have been for
a commercial venture to bring in revenue for a particular organization by analyzing
swimmers and charging for the service. In some cases the analysis systems have
been developed in universities as a research tool to assist in the biomechanical
analyses of swimmers who are participating as part of a research project.
Analysis systems which evolved include the Wetplate Analysis system developed
by the Australian Institute of Sport in Canberra (Mason et al., 2012). This system
was designed specifically to enhance the performance of members of the Australian
Institute of Sport and the Australian national swim teams. A start analysis system
was developed in Spain at the University of Granada to improve swim starting
technique (Arellano et al., 2000) as well being used in applied research. A start
analysis block was developed at the University of Porto in Portugal for research
applications (Mourao et al., 2015) as well as to service the Portuguese national
swim team. A start and turn analysis system was developed in Eindhoven in the
Netherlands, which is presently used both in a commercial venture as well as to
service the Netherlands’ national swim team (Sportstarz: Start and turn special,
Eindhoven).
Another instrumented swim start analysis system (Kibele et al., 2005) evolved in
Germany to investigate force development during start performances. The British
Aquatics Biomechanics support team in Loughborough produced an instrumented
turning plate and start block to help analyze a swimmer’s technique in turns
(Cossor et al., 2012) and starts (Slawson et al., 2013). The aim was to enhance elite

swimmers’ performances in competition as well as to be used in applied research
projects. A start and turn analysis system was developed at the Japanese Institute of
Sport Sciences and at the Hong Kong National Institute of Sport (Tempo Swimming
Analysis) to service their respective national swim squads. Both these systems were
built using the Kistler swim starting block to monitor force application during the
performance. The French Institute of Sport (INSEP) in Paris also purchased a Kistler
starting block, which was intended to be used as the force-measuring apparatus in
the French analysis system.
A similar situation as that for INSEP occurred in China with a swimming organization
in Chengdong. A device was built in the USA for research in the early 1980s to
measure forces on the hands in starts (Cavanagh et al., 1975) and in addition, the
United States Olympic Committee experimented with an instrumented starting
block that they developed. In the 1980s, the Russians developed an explosive
starting block that aided in the swimmer’s propulsion off the block during starts in a
training environment by catapulting the swimmer off the blocks. This strategy would
hopefully result in a transfer of positive technique characteristics into the swimmer’s
competition starts.
Although there have been many start and turn analysis systems developed, few, if
any, could be readily relocated and used anywhere other than the pool in which they
were developed. The analysis information provided by these systems in many cases
was very limited, and in most cases these systems were designed to examine only a
few selected parameters. Most of these systems often required a long period of time
after the data collection occurred, before the analysis was able to be completed and
feedback provided to the swimmer. There was certainly no possibility of reviewing
the analysis performed by many of these systems in the process other than by using
the system that actually collected the data.
In 2014, the Kistler and AppSen companies united with the intention of producing
an elite swim start, turn, and relay changeover biomechanical analysis system that
was sufficiently portable to be installed in almost any long course or short course
competition pool. Another requirement was that the system could be installed in a
pool by two adults without having to use lifting equipment. The system was named
PAS-S (Performance Analysis System for Swimming). The intention of PAS-S was
to provide a comprehensive bio1he swimmer’s head passed the 10-m mark on the
way out from the wall. The relay start was initiated when the incoming swimmer
touched the wall and continued until the outgoing swimmer’s head passed the 15-m
mark. The biomechanical analysis was completed for the full duration of the activity;
however, video footage was also captured prior to and after the activity had finished.
A major benefit of the PAS-S system was that in the future, an analysis completed on
one system could be exported for review to another PAS-S system.

The PAS-S Hardware
The Kistler company was responsible for the development of the hardware used in
PAS-S with biomechanical advice provided from AppSen. The block base itself was
manufactured using aluminum and was sloped downwards toward the water at an
angle of 9°. On the top of the block, two force plates were attached. There was a
front-force platform and a rear-force platform. Each force platform had inbuilt
amplifiers that were connected by way of specialized cables to the DAQ (analogue
to digital data acquisition) located beside the PAS-S computer. It was from these two
force platforms that the majority of perpendicular and propulsive whole-body forces
were measured during starts and relay changeovers. The inclined moveable rear foot
plate was located on the rear force platform and was able to be moved forward and
backward by the swimmer, which suited the swimmer’s normal back-foot starting
location preference.
The inclined plate was built
in accordance with the FINA
starting block regulations.
Below the forward force place
at the front edge of the force
platform, adjacent to the
water, was an instrumented
grab bar used to measure
the swimmer’s arm force in
a vertical upward direction
during starts. The instrumented
bar was also connected by way
of specialized cable to the DAQ.

data collection. Note the two force platforms forming the top surface with the attached rear inclined
foot plate located on the rear force platform.

The turning wall itself was a force
platform that was composed of
a carbon fibre material, which
had an array of holes through
which most of the force of a wave
during turns would be dissipated,
while the total force exerted by
the swimmer on the wall would
be completely measured. The
turning wall could be installed in
its attachment to the starting block
by two adults. The force platform
has four triaxial transducers located
at the four corners to measure
the perpendicular and vertically
downward force exerted by the
swimmer’s feet during backstroke
starts and all turns. There was also Figure 5. Two people lifting the instrumented turn wall

measure forces exerted by the arms during the backstroke start. This instrumentation
was also connected with specialized cables to the DAQ.

The PAS-S system incorporated five
100-frame-per-second machine
vision cameras, each enclosed in
a waterproof housing. There were
two cameras located at the 1.5-m
mark (one camera was located 1 m
above the water surface and the
other camera 1 m below the water
surface) together with a single
camera 1 m below the water level
located at each of the 5-m, 10-m,
and 15-m marks. Each camera was
held by a camera attachment device,
which itself was attached to the side Figure 7. A Kistler machine vision camera located in

camera attachment device itself had
the capacity to enable the cameras to rotate by tiny adjustments in both a side-to-
side and an up-and-down motion by an operator on pool deck. Each camera was
connected by a cable to accept a synchronizing pulse and power from the DAQ,
as well as an ethernet cable to transfer the digital image to the PAS-S computer.
The five ethernet cables connected directly to the PAS-S computer into their
predetermined video input ports.

A starting gun device, together with a trigger and microphone, was also installed
behind the starting block. As well as emitting the start signal sound, the starting
device also was connected by way of cable through to the DAQ to provide a voltage
pulse to the PAS-S computer when triggered.
The DAQ box was built by Kistler to accept the analogue force signals from the
two force platforms in the starting block (six channels from each force platform),
the two-channel analogue force signal from the grab bar, the analogue six-channel
force signal from the turning wall force platform, the two-channel analogue signal
from backstroke start handles, and a single voltage signal from the starting device.
All analogue force signals were measured 500 times per second by the DAQ to
be available to the PAS-S computer for processing. The DAQ also controlled the
synchronized timing of the image capture from the five machine vision cameras
by providing a pulse of 100 hertz to each of the five cameras as well as power to
operate each camera. The 100-hertz digital image from each of the five cameras was
connected directly to the PAS-S computer through five ethernet cables.

and cables for camera pulse and cable from starting device in the front of the DAQ.
The PAS-S Software
The AppSen company had the responsibility of producing a computer program
for PAS-S and providing the biomechanical output format suitable for analysis
and elite swimmer feedback. The computer program initially captured the digital
force data from the DAQ. In the case of starts, the voltage signal from the starting
device determined the initiation of the data collection. In the case of turns and relay
changeovers, the perpendicular force signals from the turn wall initiated the data
collection. Data were actually captured and saved into memory for processing prior
to the initiation of the start, turn, and relay changeover. Data capture occurs over a
period of up to seven seconds per trial. In the case of starts, this was one second
108

--- Page 110 Text ---
Chapter 9: the paS-S Swim Start, tUrn and relay ChanGeover analySiS SyStem
before initiation and three after. In the case of turns, this was four seconds before
initiation and three after. In the case of relay changeovers, this was two seconds
before initiation and three after.
The first step in the processing of the force data in starts was to convert the
perpendicular and propulsive forces from the starting block into vertical and
horizontal forces. From the force recordings, the individual horizontal and vertical
forces were summed to provide a total horizontal and vertical force exerted by the
swimmer on the block in starts and relay changeovers, and from the turn wall in
the backstroke start and in turns. The total force for the grab bar in starts and the
hand bar in backstroke starts was also calculated by summation. The velocity of the
swimmer’s CoG and the angle of the CoG off the block at the instant of take-off
was calculated from the overall vertical and horizontal forces in starts. The power
profile of the swimmer in starts and turns was obtained as the product of absolute
instantaneous force by the CoG instantaneous velocity. As the swimmer’s mass was
obtained prior to the testing, all overall body forces were converted from newtons
into body weight measures, so as to have the capacity of comparing the parameters
in the performances by swimmers of varying body mass.
Throughout the duration of the trial, video footage was captured into the PAS-S
computer memory. Various segments of the synchronized video footage were
captured from the five cameras, and the timing and the duration of the footage
captured into computer memory from each camera was dependent upon the type of
trial and the video footage required to display the swimmer’s actions.
Following the capture of a trial by the PAS-S computer but before the analysis was
complete, certain information needed to be supplied by the computer operator and
obtained from the PAS-S computer’s video images of the trial.
Initial Setup of PAS-S
The PAS-S starting block is setup at the pool in a lane that is three meters distant
from the pool’s side wall. Usually the PAS-S block will replace the regular pool
starting block located in this lane. In some pools, the PAS-S block may be bolted
directly to the pool deck, whereas in other pools, an adjustment plate may need to be
produced that attaches directly to the pool deck using the regular block attachment
bolts and upon which the PAS-S starting block is attached. The PAS-S turn wall,
when attached to the PAS-S starting block, may extend up to three centimetres into
the pool space. Permanent markings at 1.5 m, 5 m, 10 m, and 15 m out along the
side of the pool from a location at the start end, equivalent to the distance of the
PAS-S turning wall surface (approximately 3 cm) out from the end wall, should be
109
17_08_04_Contemporary_swim_start_RZ.indd 109 04.08.17 15:37

--- Page 111 Text ---
Contemporary Swim Start reSearCh
made on the side pool deck for the positions where the camera attachment devices
will be located on the pool’s side wall. These marks should be permanent. The
camera attachment device locations are numbered two to five for the underwater
cameras, with two being closest to the start block, five being most distant from
the start, and one the above-water camera. Cameras one and two share the same
camera attachment device, with camera two a meter below the water surface, and
camera one a meter above the water surface.
The lenses of all cameras should be adjusted so that the aperture of the lens is
completely open. Focus should be set at a distance equivalent to the perpendicular
distance from the lens location underwater to the center of the testing lane. The
zoom should be set for an interval distance of approximately 5 m measured in the
center of the testing lane from the camera’s normal position on the side wall. The
cameras should be inserted into their respective underwater housings with the
housing caps off. The final lens adjustments should then be performed, so the zoom
is accurately set at covering an interval distance equivalent to 5 m underwater at
a distance equal to the center of the testing lane from the lens. The zoom setting
is most easily performed by converting the 5 m underwater distance interval to
an equivalent distance in air, taking into account the optical refractive index in air
as opposed to water. The rough conversion for 5 m in water is equivalent to about
7.2 m in air. The adjustment of the zoom is more easily performed in air rather than
beneath the water’s surface, which would require the camera to be continually
taken out of the water, together with the removal of the housing cap to perform
adjustments. The above-water zoom adjustment for each camera lens is performed
while that camera is in the above-water camera attachment location (camera 1).
It is interesting to note at this point that because all the lenses are variable focal
length lenses, the focus also changes as you alter the zoom on the lens. Therefore,
this setting adjustment will require the user to set both the focus and zoom together.
The zoom adjustments for all cameras should be performed with each camera in
turn, attached to the above-camera location to view a marked interval of 7.2 m with
the camera cable connected to the camera 1 port on the computer. The image from
each camera is viewed on the PAS-S computer monitor, while the PAS-S program is
operating in the appropriate mode. During this process, ensure that the camera lens’
optical axis is perpendicular to the lane and that the edge of the image just remains
inside the marked interval.
Once the lenses on all five cameras are effectively adjusted for aperture, focus,
and zoom, the cap on all the underwater housings should be closed. All camera
attachment devices should then be installed on the side pool wall at their respective
marks, with the correct cameras attached to each camera attachment device. The
image from the cameras can then be viewed when the PAS-S program is operational
in the appropriate mode. Commencing from camera 2, attached in its normal location
110
17_08_04_Contemporary_swim_start_RZ.indd 110 04.08.17 15:37

--- Page 112 Text ---
Chapter 9: the paS-S Swim Start, tUrn and relay ChanGeover analySiS SyStem
and connected to the computer in the number 2 camera port, make sure the camera’s
optical axis is perpendicular to the pool side wall and ensure the camera’s image
covers the desired area at the center of the testing lane. The vertical inclination of
the camera should be such that the picture image just excludes the near lane rope
of the testing lane, and the image should include the full underwater view of the
turning wall at the end of the lane. Camera 3 is then attached in the number 3 camera
attachment device and connected to the number 3 port of the computer.
Camera 3 has a reduced interval image length compared to all the other cameras
with only a 4-m interval image length rather than the usual 5 m. This reduction
occurs when the number 3 camera is connected to the camera port 3. The orientation
of the number 3 camera should be adjusted so that the images from both cameras 2
and 3 are continuous. That is, there should be very little overlap of the image from
the adjacent camera, and there should be no gap in the image from the adjacent
camera. This effect is most easily achieved using the special PAS-S figure, designed
to assist in adjusting the adjacent camera images. A similar process is performed
with all the other cameras in turn, with camera 1 being the last camera to be
incorporated into the setup. Camera 1, being the above-water camera, may have
Figure 12. PAS-S calibration figure used to align adjacent
cameras so that there is a continuous image from one camera
to the next. Calibration figure out of water behind starting block.

both the zoom and focus slightly adjusted so as to align the camera’s image with the
image from camera 2. This adjustment is easily performed as the housing cap on
camera 1 may remain off until all other cameras are aligned with one another.
Calibration of PAS-S System
Calibration of the PAS-S setup consists of calibrating a virtual vertical plane that is
at the center of the lane out from the starting block that extends from the center of
the instrumented wall to a location beyond the 15-m mark. This process is performed
by digitizing marks on a pole that are at half-meter intervals above and below the
surface of the water when the pole is held vertically upright at different distances
in the center of the lane and out from the turning wall. This operation is generally
performed by three people. They are the computer operator, the person in the water
controlling the pole, and a person at the block with a laser-beam distance measurer.
This process commences with the pole against the turning wall (distance out = 0.0
m) at the center of the testing lane. The person in the water holds the pole vertically
upright with the set mark on the pole at the water surface and with marks on the
pole at half meter intervals above and below the water level. The person with the
laser measures the distance out from the wall and calls that distance out to the
computer operator, who types it into the computer and then captures the image from
all relevant cameras. The laser-measuring device is used to measure the distance of
the pole from the wall. This process is repeated at approximately one-meter intervals
out from the wall and in the center of the lane, until the 17-meter distance from the
wall is reached. After capturing all calibration images, the computer operator then
digitizes all the marks on the pole in each image from any camera view from which he
can identify a mark. At the completion of this process, the computer then processes
the information captured to identify the location of any point in the virtual vertical
plane; that is the testing zone in which the swimmer will perform. This process then
enables the computer to identify the location in meters of any digitized point on a
camera image in the center of the testing lane, with respect to depth in the water and
distance from the turning wall. When a new PAS-S system is purchased, the initial
setup, calibration, and training of staff is completed by AppSen.
Regular Setup of PAS-S
This is an easy process, provided that the camera attachment device markings on
pool deck are readily identified and the camera lens settings (aperture, focus, and
zoom) have not been altered since the initial setup. The block is readily moved into
position and attached to the pool deck as previously performed in the initial setup.
The cameras should be retained in their underwater housings for storage purposes
such that the aperture, focus, and zoom remain unaltered. To repeat the setup of
the system, fix each camera to its appropriate camera attachment device and install
each camera attachment device on the pool side wall with the suction cups and in
the location as indicated by the permanent markings on pool deck. The cameras may
be gently rotated laterally and vertically using the sensitive movement knob on top

of each camera attachment device, such that the position of known points in the pool
line up with the digitized markings on each camera image. There should be about
three digitized markings on each camera image that were actually chosen for this
purpose during the initial setup. All cables are attached to the DAQ and computer as
in the initial setup. This makes the PAS-S system ready for data capture.
The Mode of Operation
A swimmer’s start, turn, and relay changeover may be analyzed with only two people.
One person operates the computer, while the other is generally located behind the
starting block and is responsible for providing instructions to the swimmer. Prior to
any data collection by the PAS-S system, the information about the swimmer will
need to be input into the PAS-S program before the PAS-S system is reset by the
computer operator. During the reset process it is important that nothing touches any
of the PAS-S equipment. The swimmer is then instructed to move onto the center of
the starting block and stand upright without any movement. When the swimmer is
perfectly stationary, the person behind the blocks indicates to the computer operator
to commence the data acquisition from PAS-S to measure the swimmer’s weight.
Once this is done the swimmer is instructed to move off the starting block, and
the system is reset again before any further data collection. The swimmer is then
instructed as to what is required of the performance.
One special note here is that the swimmer should perform in the center of the lane.
In starts and relay changeovers, the swimmer should swim through the 15-m mark
as they would be expected in competition. In turns, the swimmer should commence
the in-swim at the 15-m mark, stay in the center of the lane in both directions, turn
as close as possible to the center of the turning wall, and swim beyond the 10-m
mark on the way out. In starts, the person behind the blocks generally operates the
starting signal. If a swimmer is to complete any more than one trial in a day, he or she
does not need to be weighed again. It is preferable that the analysis is processed for
any trial before another trial is performed.
Data Capture
The PAS-S program is such that after all required information has been input from
the keyboard and the program is set into operation, the data capture itself is initiated
by the starting signal for starts, the force of the incoming swimmer touching the
wall for relay changeovers, and by the force of the swimmer touching the wall in
turns. Because force data and video images are buffered in the computer’s memory,
sections of the data signal from the force transducers and images from the cameras
that occurred prior to the initiating signal are able to be included as part of the
analysis in the trial.

Processing of a Trial
There are a number of points that need to be identified and digitized after a trial
has been captured. This is usually done by the computer operator. In the start, this
includes the center of the head at the starting signal, the position of the swimmer’s
CoG, and the center of the swimmer’s head at the instant of leaving the block. At the
instant of head contact with the water, the top of the head is to be digitized as well
as the furthest and least distant entry point of the swimmer’s entry into the water.
After entry, the center of the head should be digitized at the swimmer’s lowest point
in the underwater trajectory, the center of the head at the first kick, and the top
of the head at the instant of breakout. To obtain the interval timing, the center of
the head should be digitized at the 5-m mark, 7.5-m mark, 10-m mark, and 15-m
mark as indicated by red displacement vertical lines that are superimposed over the
performance image. The time to the 7.5-m mark is obtained by digitizing the center
of the head from two separate camera images.
Similar information is required for relay change overs. For turns, the following points
need to be digitized. The center of the head is digitized at the instance of leaving the
wall, at the instance of the first kick, at the lowest point in the underwater trajectory,
and at breakout. Interval timing is obtained in a similar fashion to starts by digitizing
the center of the head at the 5-m mark, with the swimmer travelling toward the wall
and again while travelling away from the wall with the head at 5 m, 7.5 m, and 10 m.
As with starts, the 7.5 m is digitized on two separate camera images.
At this point the analysis is complete and the trial may be reviewed.
The Analysis Output
The PAS-S system was developed to assist coaches enhance the performance
of their swimmers. The program is not intended to make decisions about how a
swimmer’s performance should be altered, but rather it analyzes what the swimmer
is doing at the present time so that the coach may make decisions about what
should be changed to improve the swimmer’s performance. The first stage in making
improvements in performance is an analysis to identify what is actually happening at
the present time before identifying what should be changed. A decision then needs
to be made about changes that should be made to the present performance. The
skill may then be practized with the changes incorporated into the skill before the
swimmer is again tested to measure the effect of such change.
Slow motion video is provided in the analysis of all starts, turns, and relay
changeovers. The image of the performance that is viewed on the PAS-S monitor
is as if there is a camera moving alongside the swimmer so that a relatively large

image is provided of the swimmer and his or her actions. Added to this image are
biomechanical parameters that may or may not also be displayed on the image.
Such parameters that may be overlayed on the performance image of starts and
relay changeovers include the force vectors generated against the block, the path
of the swimmer’s CoG after leaving the block until entry into the water, the angle
of the swimmer’s entry into the water with the swimmer’s absolute velocity at that
point, the location and size of the swimmer’s entry hole in the water, the path of
the swimmer’s trajectory under the water from entry until breakout, the location of
swimmer’s maximum depth, the location of the first underwater kick (displayed on
the underwater trajectory path), and the distance and time of breakout.
Graphs may also be viewed that include the parameters of vertical and horizontal
forces exerted by the swimmer on the block, the forces exerted by the hands on
the grab bar, the vertical and horizontal velocities of the swimmer produced as
a consequence of the force exerted by the swimmer on the block, as well as the
power output of the swimmer in the start. An alternative graph that may be viewed
indicates velocity and displacement parameters of the swimmer throughout the start.
Other information that may be provided as statistics associated with the overall
start trial include time to reach the 15-m mark, first movement time, time off the
block, the angle the swimmer’s CoG as projected off the block, the velocity of the
swimmer off the block, and maximum values for all forces and power and when they
were achieved during the time on the block. One difference between the start and
relay changeover statistics is that in relay changeovers, the changeover duration is
provided rather than the time on the block.
Similar information that is relevant to turns is provided in the turn analysis. This
information includes the force vectors generated against the wall, the path of the
swimmer’s CoG after leaving the wall until breakout, the location of swimmer’s
maximum depth, and the location of the first underwater kick (displayed on the
underwater trajectory path), together with the distance and time of breakout. Graphs
may also be viewed that include the parameters of vertical and horizontal forces
exerted by the swimmer on the wall, together with the power output achieved by the
swimmer on the wall in the turn. An alternative graph that may be viewed indicates
the velocity and displacement parameters of the swimmer throughout the turn. Other
information that may be provided as statistics associated with the overall turn trial
include time in the turn (5 m on the way in to 10 m on the way out), overall duration
on the wall, duration of foot contact on the wall, depth of foot contact on the wall,
the angle that the swimmer’s CoG is projected off the wall (thrust angle) as well as
alignment angle, and the overall impulse achieved against the wall.
The analysis feedback from the PAS-S program usually involves watching a review
of the trial on the PAS-S computer monitor. Other methods of feedback may be
provided in the form of a video mpeg file, or in the form of a PAS-S data file that may
115

be run on another computer with a modified version of PAS-S, or as a paper printout
using a picture that highlights the problem in the performance, where comments
may be included.
For the PAS-S system to be most effective in the enhancement of swimmer
performance, the swimmer’s coach is the best person to provide feedback to the
swimmer. This is the case because the coach generally understands how the
swimmer relates to comment about performance, and it is the coach who works with
the swimmer during all training sessions. The coach is there to remind the swimmer
of things he or she needs to practice, as well as to correct the swimmer when
the swimmer falls into previous not-so-good habits. However, for the coach to be
effective during the feedback session, the coach must understand the biomechanical
parameters that are provided and their implication to performance.

Chapter 9: the paS-S Swim Start, tUrn and relay ChanGeover analySiS SyStem
Although a biomechanist is probably better able to interpret the PAS-S analysis
and convey information to the swimmer, the biomechanist probably only interacts
with the swimmer during the testing sessions. As the swimmer must make changes
that are automatic in his or her performance, the biomechanist is not sufficiently
present to make sure the changes are engrained into the swimmer’s performance.
Probably the best way for the coach to become competent providing feedback from
PAS-S analysis is for the coach and biomechanist to work together for some time
providing feedback to swimmers. Another important factor for the PAS-S analysis
to be effective is that the testing should not occur during training sessions where
the swimmers take time out of their training sessions to be tested. PAS-S testing
should occur outside training sessions, where time is put aside for testing followed
by feedback, and where the coach is fully involved in this process. With the standard
PAS-S system, the testing and the feedback are provided by the same computer. It
is quite possible for a server computer to be incorporated into the PAS-S system,
whereby the test data are stored on the server so that analysis feedback may be
provided while the testing of another swimmer occurs. In this scenario, while one
swimmer is being tested, another swimmer is receiving feedback, while a third
swimmer is practicing skills that have been altered.
Other Valuable Features of PAS-S
Probably one of the most effect ways of identifying problems in performance is to
compare that performance with that of another swimmer who is better skilled in the
activity. PAS-S has the facility to display the performances from two different trials
that are synchronized in time with both images on the one screen, with one trial
above the other. This method is definitely a good way of both identifying problems
in technique as well as to demonstrate to a swimmer during feedback the point that
is being made. PAS-S has many other features, too numerous to list in this paper. If
PAS-S is used in a research situation, there are also digitizing facilities that may be
utilized.
