Foreword by the IOC

The athlete’s health has always been a priority for the
International Olympic Committee. I therefore wel-
come the initiative by the IOC Medical Commission,
with Blackwell Publishing, to republish, after 12 years,
the Swimming handbook.

An Olympic sport since the first Games of the
modern era in 1896, swimming has always aroused
great interest among both the public and the medical-
scientific community.

Through the diversity of its disciplines, and espe-
cially because it is practised in an unnatural environ-
ment for man, swimming has always been the subject

of a great deal of sports-medicine research. This re-
search, both biomechanical and biophysiological, has
brought about an improvement in athletes’ condi-
tions and training equipment and, consequently, their
performances.

Tam convinced that this book will be a useful refer-
ence tool for sports doctors as well as the medical and
paramedical entourage of any athlete. Let us thank the
authors for this!

Foreword by FINA

On behalf of the Fédération Internationale de Nata-
tion (FINA), it is my pleasure to introduce you to
the second edition of Swimming, an IOC Handbook
of Sports Medicine and Science, which is mainly de-
voted to the physical, biomechanical, psychological,
medical and training problems in competitive swim-
ming. As world governing body for the disciplines of
swimming, diving, water polo, synchronised swim-
ming and open water swimming, FINA is obviously in-
terested in the widest possible transmission of knowl-
edge to our athletes, coaches, physicians and officials
involved in our sport.

As one of FINA’s goals is to disseminate and accel-
erate the participation of young competitors in our
disciplines, it is of relevant importance to detect, cor-
rect and prevent the health or injury problems that are
inevitably associated with the practice of any physical
activity. The engagement in this area led to the cre-
ation of a FINA World Sports Medicine Congress, held ev-
ery two years, and to which are invited scientific and
clinical experts with an interest in the field of medicine
applied to aquatic sports.

We are also proud of counting with the FINA Sports
Medicine Committee that has the duty of providing
medical and sport science expertise and gives recom-
mendations regarding health conditions in the prac-
tice of our sports. The professors, doctors and other
specialists of this Committee are continuously search-
ing for new ideas and suggestions on how to improve
and develop the medical aspects of our aquatic disci-
plines.

This Handbook, edited by the IOC, is a precious tool
to help our members in the prosecution of their activ-
ities, as our main goal is to be useful to the aquatic
community formed by our 187 Member National Fed-
erations. That is why I especially salute the editors and
contributors who devoted their time and effort to the
elaboration of this publication.

At a recent coaching convention, one of the keynote
speakers concluded that nothing particularly inno-
vative has happened within competitive swimming
in the last 25 years. The speaker presented evidence
that illustrated his point and cited swim goggles, lane
lines, interval training, touch pads, pace clocks, and
age group swimming as important innovations that
acted to transform competitive swimming in the 1950s
through the 1970s. It is our hope that while this argu-
ment might be seen by some to be valid, the topics
presented within this handbook will be cause for this
conclusion to be challenged.

The truth is that the world of competitive sports is
far from static and is constantly changing. It should be
obvious that significant change has resulted from re-
cent advances in science and technology. The history
of our sport over the course of the past 100 years of or-
ganized competitive swimming is essentially a descrip-
tion of the athletes, their coaches, and their collective
accomplishments. In the next decade, however, the
history of swimming will be defined by advances in
technology, spearheaded by scientific innovators.

In the past year, the world lost two men devoted
to innovation and science in swimming. Allen B.
Richardson, MD, coauthor of the first edition of this
handbook, passed away in September 2003. Then in
January 2004 we lost our mentor and friend, James E.
(Doc) Counsilman. Both men were committed to im-
proving performance and prolonging the “competi-
tive lives” of swimmers by adapting knowledge from
far-ranging fields into the daily routines of swim-
mers. We, therefore, respectfully dedicate this book to
them.

Our association with Doc Counsilman goes back
over 35 years and we both admit to have been greatly
influenced by his lifelong passion for swimming. Doc
often lectured about the “Three C’s of Learning: Cu-
riosity, Confusion, and Comprehension.” Learning
begins with curiosity as to why we do something or
how this or that works. Confusion follows when things
don’t make sense or the rationale behind a practice is
found faulty. Comprehension results from repeated
observations and the testing of hypotheses. Over the
course of time, by asking questions and challenging
the status quo, advances in knowledge are attained. To
paraphrase from Robert Persig, “Scientific truth is not
dogma, good for eternity, but a temporal quantitative
entity... the time spans of scientific truths are an in-
verse function of the intensity of scientific effort. The
more you look, the more you see.” Doc Counsilman
was most proud of his ability to question, see, and then
implement new things that would directly affect how

the sport, one with the curiosity and the motivation to
delve into the fine details. Some of this material is very

Introduction

Human performance begins at the cellular level, thus
the discussion pertaining to the physiology of swim
performance must begin there as well. Ultimately, as
a swimmer’s cells go, so goes the rest of the body. An
architect knows that when the bricks of a wall begin to
crumble, the building willeventually fall! Sotoo, when
the metabolic processes of the cells fail, the swimmer
can no longer perform.

The concepts that govern cells and their viability are
the same as those that govern the body, its tissues, and
organ systems. Tissues are collections of different cell
types while organs consist of different tissue types. Or-
gans make up systems and systems make up the body,
ultimately constituting a competitive swimmer. How
a swimmer adapts to a training regime and the causes
of a swimmer’s fatigue are determined at the level of
the cell; therefore, swim performance is conferred up-
wards to the complexity level of the entire athlete. The
muscle cells are the star performers and the cardiopul-
monary, gastrointestinal, renal, and CNS represent the
supporting cast.

Regardless of the nature of the response or specific
task performed, all physiological work done by a mus-
cle cell requires energy. Although the various cells and
cell types of the body are specialized to perform dif-
ferent physiological functions, regardless of the type
of work performed, cell metabolism must increase to
meet energy needs or work cannot continue. The first
point of discussion concerning swim performance
and fatigue then is how cells (in particular the muscle

cells) supply the energy to do physiological and physi-
cal work. Once a basis for understanding is developed,
this information can provide a better platform upon
which a rational training plan can be built.

Energy for exercise

The ability to increase the mechanical work done by
the swimmer is ultimately determined by the ability
ofthe muscle cells to provide the energy todo the work.
Whole body metabolic rate can increase more than 40-
fold in well-conditioned athletes, with the increased
rate of metabolism of the various active tissues (skele-
tal muscles) being nearly 100 times their metabolic
rate at rest. The increase in energy demand is supplied
by accelerating the output of several metabolic path-
ways. The metabolic pathways that provide energy
can be separated into those that do not require oxy-
gen, the immediately available phosphogens and gly-
colysis, and the single metabolic pathway that does,
the Krebs or tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (Fig. 1.1).
The maximum energy outputs of these three pathways
will determine the ultimate performance in swim-
ming events ranging from 50 to 1500 m and beyond.
At rest, a swimmer’s oxygen consumption is appro-
ximately one third of a liter per minute. The oxygen
consumption of mature, elite, well-trained swimmers
can exceed 6 1-min7' during near maximal swim-
ming. Estimates of the increase in nonoxidative en-
ergy production during swimming are more difficult
to make and impossible to measure. Estimates suggest,

From the perspective of a typical swimming event,
two issues are evident. First, although nonoxygen con-
suming pathways are considered less efficient, they
must provide the energy at the beginning of exercise
because oxidative (aerobic) metabolism requires sev-
eral minutes to fully accelerate. There is no way for the
cells to anticipate the metabolic power output prior
to a muscular contraction. For a short period of time
then, at the beginning of a swim bout, there is a deficit
between the energy required to do work and the ox-
idative means to supply it (Fig. 1.2).

Second, energy requirements beyond those which
can be provided by aerobic metabolism must come
from more than one metabolic pathway. The instan-
taneous power output that many muscles are capa-
ble of performing is greater than that which can be
supported by aerobic metabolism. Therefore, at high

tribution, the shorter the time this high power output

Source of energy for exercise

Ultimately, the energy to do cellular work is derived
from chemical bonds and is contained within the
compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is pro-
duced within each cell from intracellular as well as
extracellular substrates. The maximal ATP production
of the cell is related to the concentration of reactants,
cofactors, and the concentration and characteristics
of the various enzymatic pathways.

Under certain circumstances the ability of the cells
to produce ATP may be limited by the availability of the

is not much room within most cells for maintaining

skeletal muscle cells. Maximal sustained rates of work
are not a function of immediately available “stored

performance is the rate at which the raw substrates can

Thus itis that ATP exists in the body in limited quan-
tities, ie., there are no vast stockpiles of ATP within
the cell or within the body as there is no place to store
it. Biochemists estimate that only about 100 g of ATP
can be purified from the human body. Roughly half
this ATP exists within the skeletal muscles. In contrast,
the amount of ATP required to do all of the necessary

proximately the amount of additional ATP required to

The breakdown of ATP to ADP and inorganic phos-

that signals the acceleration of energy consumption
and therefore energy production. But, the immedi-

Creatine phosphate is the other readily available phos-

(4 g-kg~!). However, it is important to reiterate that

swimmers have the ability to convert substrates into
energy very quickly. It is this turnover rate, the rate at
which ATP can be recycled from ADP or CP, that largely
influences mid- to long-distance swim performances.

One important conclusion from this knowledge is
that it is virtually worthless to ingest ATP as a means
to improve performance. Various supplement prod-

It cannot be said that significant stockpiles of fuel
substrates from which energy can be metabolized to
form ATP do not exist. Adipose cells, which comprise
the fat pads of the body, serve as reservoirs of lipids.
Muscle cells have local extracellular fat deposits as
well as intracellular lipid reservoirs. Lipids, or rather
fatty acids, are available to the cells as particularly effi-

logical work, this stored fat can provide the energy for
nearly 100 days. But once again, having lots of fat does

In contrast to fats, however, carbohydrates are not

are no sugar cubes or subcutaneous sugar crystals that

represent an important substrate during exercise, they
are perceived as limiting to prolonged performances
and extended swim practices. Studies suggest that the
carbohydrate stores within the active muscle can be
easily depleted within a typical swim workout and that
the ability to replenish these carbohydrate stores be-
tween workouts may be acritical factorin training well.

One of the effects of intensive physical swim train-
ing is to adapt the muscle cells to use more fat as a fuel
source. This occurs presumably as a means to spare the
cell’s limited carbohydrate supplies. Because of their
importance in fueling exercise, carbohydrate intake
is an important parameter to monitor in swimmers
participating in multiple workout days and multiple
practice days per week. The importance of carbohy-
drate metabolism should be evident from the exten-
sive interest in the role of lactic acid formation during
and following swimming bouts. Lactic acid produc-
tion comes as a direct result of using carbohydrates as
a fuel source to generate energy during an intensive
swim effort.

The flip side of elite performance and its understand-
ing is an analysis of the factors that cause fatigue dur-
ing practice as well as during acompetitive swim event.
While fatigue is multifactorial, one well-accepted, fun-
damental cause of fatigue is the inability to maintain
the energy requirements of the muscle. A detailed ex-
planation of carbohydrate metabolism via glycolysis
is appropriate, as is a closer look at what Brooks et al.
(1996) refer to as “the mythology of lactic acid.”

Three metabolic pathways

There are three pathways for generating energy: the
ATP-CP system, glycolysis, and aerobic metabolism.
We also know that there are three substrates from

which cellular energy can be derived: carbohydrates,
fats, and proteins. Finally, we know that each path-
way has defined upper limits, or capacities, that are
“trainable” to different extents.

ATP-CP: the (nearly) immediately
available energy

At the onset of exercise, the first metabolic pathway
engaged provides energy derived from the available
intracellular ATP and CP within the muscle cell. This
pathway involves the phosphogens ATP and CP anda
single enzyme, creatine kinase, that catalyzes the re-
action between the two. A second pathway, referred to
as the myokinase system, generates ATP (and an AMP)
from two ADP molecules. It acts to buffer the fall in ATP
when energy needs are extreme. Beyond a description
of the intermediates and the energetic capacity of the
pathway, there isn’t much more to be said about the

essentially in proportion to increases in muscle vol-

Or so.

Current debate surrounds the effectiveness of using
creatine and/or phosphate asa means to increase intra-
cellular concentrations prior to exercise. Recent data
are inconsistent concerning the ability to increase cre-
atine levels through dietary manipulation. Some re-
ports suggest that increased intake of creatine can en-
hance power output during short sprint performance
through perhaps the 200-m events. The data specifi-
cally concerning improvements in swim performance
due to creatine supplementation are difficult to inter-
pret as the research designs used in these studies are
easy to criticize.

Glycolysis

Glycolysis, the second pathway, metabolizes carbohy-
drates and involves a series of 12 enzymes and multi-
ple metabolic intermediates (Fig. 1.5). The pathway
breaks down glucose as the fuel substrate, requires
no oxygen, and ends with the production of ATP
and either pyruvate or lactic acid. During prolonged
exercise, glycolysis is limited by the availability of car-
bohydrates as a source of energy. The carbohydrate

Inthe glycolytic pathway, two net ATP molecules are
produced from sugar (commonly a 6-carbon glucose
molecule; CgH;205) while NAD*, a vitamin-derived
cofactor, is reduced to NADH + H*. NADH is referred
to as the “universal hydrogen acceptor” and is impor-
tant in the electron transport chain (ETC) and oxida-
tive phosphorylation. The final metabolic intermedi-
ates of glycolysis are two pyruvate molecules (three
carbons each) that are then further metabolized to
acetyl-CoA, which funnels through the TCA cycle
(within the mitochondria) and is metabolized into
six carbon dioxide molecules (one carbon each) and
six water molecules (12 hydrogens and six oxygens;
6 x HzO). The NADH equivalents generated in the pro-
cess are shuttled to the mitochondria for further pro-
duction of ATP via the ETC (Salway 1995).

If the carbons of the original substrate are followed
through glycolysis, a 6-carbon glucose molecule fin-
ishes with two 3-carbon molecules of either pyruvate
or lactic acid (C3Hs503 or C3H6O3, respectively). Four
ATP molecules are produced in this process but two
are required to get the process going. Thus, the net
gain in ATP is only two molecules. The big question
is: What causes lactic acid to be formed rather than
pyruvic acid?

The origin of lactic acid

When glycolytic flux is in excess of mitochondrial
uptake (for instance, 15 s after the start of a 100-m
freestyle), NADH reduces pyruvate to lactate via fer-
mentation. The enzyme involved is lactate dehydro-
genase (LDH) (enzyme K in Fig. 1.5). This reaction is
necessary to regenerate the limited supply of NADt
needed to maintain a constant carbon flux through
glycolysis. In other words, NAD* can be considered a
limiting factor in glycolysis. When NAD* is no longer
available, glycolysis will stop halfway. Metabolism of
pyruvate, either through the TCA cycle via mitochon-
drial activity or through its conversion into lactic acid,
results in reconversion of NAD* from NADH + Ht. A
high ratio of NADH + H*t/NAD* will stimulate the
conversion of pyruvate to lactate and a low ratio will
have the opposite effect.

Glycolysis is able to proceed because lactic acid has
been formed from pyruvic acid, thereby regenerating
NAD? to serve as a coenzyme for glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (enzyme F in Fig. 1.5).

Since the pyruvaic acid to lactic acid reaction is
energetically favorable, fermentation via this route en-
sures a constant supply of NAD* during times when
the carbon flux through glycolysis exceeds the mito-
chondrial capacity to use pyruvate via the TCA cycle.
Simply stated, lactic acid will be produced virtually
anytime glycolysis takes place regardless of the absence
or presence of Op.

It should be pointed out that if NAD+ were not
regenerated, and all available NAD* were reduced to
NADH + H?*, no ATP could be generated via glycol-
ysis and glycolysis would cease at glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate (molecule 5 in Fig. 1.5). Metabolism would
be limited to other fuel sources and power output low-
ered considerably. Regardless of the cellular environ-
ment, in order to keepa carbon flux through glycolysis,
NADt must be regenerated. It can be concluded, then,
that the net formation of lactate or pyruvate depends
on the relative glycolytic and mitochondrial flux, and
not on the presence or absence of oxygen. The for-
mation of lactate allows the metabolism of carbohy-
drates to continue, resulting in the rapid production
of needed energy to sustain intensive muscular work.

The downside of glycolysis, however, is generally
considered to be the accumulation of lactic acid. Once
generated, lactic acid at normal pH completely dissoci-
ates into a lactate ion (C3HsO3) and a proton (H*). As
described previously, whenever pyruvate is generated,
so too will lactic acid.

Muscular fatigue is a very complex topic. It has been
suggested to be mediated, in part, by acidity (a de-
crease in tissue pH or increased [H*]). The formation of
lactic acid, and its subsequent dissociation to lactate,
and a positively charged proton (H*) is a major source

. of metabolic acidosis during intense exercise. The ac-

cumulation of H* ions has been associated with a
decrement in the ability to produce force in the exer-
cising muscle by interfering with the contractile prop-
erties of the muscle, as well as by altering the chemical
milieu of the cytosolic enzymes. Thus, glycolysis can
be inhibited by its own end products, namely the ac-
cumulation of hydrogen ions and acidosis.

It may be tempting to conclude that there is no lac-
tate production during swimming if lactate concen-
tration in the blood does not exceed resting levels. At
rest and during easy, steady-rate swimming, lactate is
produced and consumed (i.e., cleared from the blood)

The OBLA may be caused by many factors, including
any factor that independently influences the produc-
tion or removal of lactic acid from the blood. Several
factors combine to increase lactic acid production and
decrease removal during intenseexercise. Forexample,
when fast glycolytic fibers (Type IIb) are recruited to
contract during intense exercise, they produce lactate
regardless of the availability of oxygen (Moritani et al.
1984). The autonomic nervous system may influence
OBLAas well. Sympathetic stimulation of the pancreas
results in the release of glucagon, which, along with
epinephrine, results in glycogenolysis in the muscle
and liver, respectively. The result is an increase in the
availability of glycogen—the fuel for glycolysis. Lastly,
adrenergic stimulation and subsequent vasoconstric-
tion of arterioles serve to redirect blood flow during in-
tense exercise so as to maintain adequate cardiac out-
put to exercising muscles, while shunting blood away
from the relatively low-metabolic tissues with high re-
sistance to flow (i.e., kidney and liver). The result is
reduced blood flow to gluconeogenic tissues (tissues
with net uptake of lactate) and diminished capacity
for lactate removal from the blood. During very heavy
exercise, such as sprint swimming, the blood flow go-
ing to the active muscle is 10-20 times more than that
which goes to the brain and gluconeogenic tissues.
The uptake, or clearance rate, of lactate is thus compro-
mised relative to the rate at which it is being produced.

The fate of lactic acid

The heart and most slow twitch fibers (Type I) have a
very high capacity to clear lactate from the blood to
the extent that these muscles use lactate as a preferred
fuel source. This occurs because there are a number of
LDH isozymes (enzyme Kin Fig. 1.5) that vary in terms
of the direction in which they catalyze the lactate-
pyruvate reaction. Those found within the heart and
Type I fibers favor the backwards reaction (i.e., lactate
to pyruvate), which facilitates the net uptake of lactate
from the blood. Indeed, the metabolic fate of most
lactate is oxidation via mitochondrial metabolism,

A secondary fate of lactic acid is glucose. Lactate dif-
fuses from the exercising muscle into the capillaries
where it is transported, via the blood stream, to the
liver (Fig. 1.3). In the presence of oxygen, hepatocytes
oxidize lactate to pyruvate that can then be converted
to glucose by gluconeogenesis. The glucose can then
be exported out of the liver and delivered back to the
exercising muscle to serve as a metabolic substrate.
This process is known as the Cori cycle and is augmen-
ted by another short pathway, the alanine-glucose
cycle. In this cycle, alanine, an amino acid, is synthe-
sized in muscle from pyruvate via a transamination
reaction. The alanine is released into the blood stream
and travels to the liver where it is deaminated to form
urea and glucose via gluconeogenesis (Salway 1995).

Thus, lactate should not be viewed as a metabolic
waste product, as some authors have stated in the
past, but rather as a valuable form of potential energy.
Lactate is a source of chemical potential energy that is
oxidized during exercise, during recovery, and at rest.
It can be converted into glucose and either metabo-
lized or stored as glycogen for later use. This fact is
now recognized by several sport nutrition companies.

Aerobic metabolism

In contrast to the other two pathways, aerobic
metabolism can continue to produce energy almost
indefinitely. It is much more complex than the non-
oxygen using pathways and depends on a robust car-
diopulmonary system. The TCAcycle exists within the
mitochondria, rather than within the water-soluble
cytosol of the cell. Energy production via this pathway
requires oxygen asa final proton and electron acceptor
plus the ETC (electron transport chain) to phospho-
rylate ADP (Fig. 1.7). The ETC is located on the inner
membranes of the mitochondria. The measurement
of oxygen consumption reflects the contribution of
this pathway as a source of energy during exercise.
The TCA cycle generates NADH and carbon dioxide
from the available fuel sources, while the ETC gener-
ates ATP from ADP (by shuttling electrons and protons
supplied by NADH), and forms energy, water, and heat
as final products.

The aerobic pathway begins with acetyl-CoA as the
initial substrate. CoA, or more correctly Coenzyme A,

cycle can be simplified and described as a pathway
that involves ATP production, CO2 production, and fi-
nally, NADH production. The TCA cycle completes the
catabolism of glucose, proteins, and fats to the simple
compounds CO, and water with the assistance of the
ETC. The TCA cycle performs the same function for all
three primary fuel substrates, by essentially cataboliz-
ing acetate to CO2, ATP, and NADH.

Current understanding is that the substrates
needed for mitochondrial metabolism are generally
in excess of the capacity of the mitochondria to utilize
them. Thus, it does not appear that substrate avail-
ability limits maximal aerobic metabolism. The limit
seems to be set by the capacity to provide oxygen to
the ETC, establishing an upper limit to mitochondrial
energy production.

Certainly mitochondrial volume plays a role in this
regard. As mitochondrial volume increases, so do the
concentration of enzymes involved in the TCA cy-
cle and the ETC cytochromes. Mitochondrial volume
seems well matched to capillary density and most
other links in the respiratory chain. It appears that
the limits to aerobic capacity are shared across the en-
tire system and a good match exists between virtu-
ally all variables that could be identified as limiting. A
closer look at the factors that potentially limit aerobic
metabolism will be made in Chapter 2.

The important concept to reinforce is that the en-
ergy required for exercise is fueled through multiple
pathways and multiple fuel sources. ATP is the ulti-
mate “exchange unit” in doing work and requires di-
versified inputs from multiple pathways to sustain the
high rate of power output required to perform exercise.
Asthe complexity of the pathway increases (ATP-CP <
glycolysis < TCA), the time required to accelerate up
to capacity increases as the need for intermediate
reactions, optimal concentrations of substrates, and
cofactors exists.

In brief, when very intense exercise is required, such
as in a 25-m sprint lasting 12 s or less, most of the
energy will be supplied in the form of ATP and CP.
Because so little ATP and CP exist within the muscle,
exercise fueled only by these sources cannot last much
longer than this. Glycogenolysis (the breakdown of
sugar stored within the muscle) and glycolysis provide
most of the energy for longer efforts lasting anywhere

time aerobic metabolism has ramped up to meet the
high-energy demands of the active muscles. Neverthe-
less, glycolysis continues to supplement aerobic en-
ergy sources even during prolonged events.

Relative contributions of aerobic
and anaerobic metabolism

There is no easy way of actually measuring the con-
tributions of the three pathways during swimming,
and thus, all values provided are estimates at best. Fur-
thermore, a number of additional assumptions must
be made in order for us to begins to calculate these
contributions.

Each energy system has a different capacity to gener-
ate power during swimming. Available estimates sug-
gest that the maximum rate of the ATP-CP system
to generate energy is about 36 kcal-min™!. Glycolysis
can generate energy at a rate that is roughly half of
this or about 16 kcal-min~!. Aerobic metabolism has
the ability to generate energy at a rate of only about
10 kcal. min-'. However, the capacities of the three
pathways can vary among individuals and within in-
dividuals. This means that depending upon genetics
and training state, the immediate ATP might supply as
much as 50 kcal -min~!. The glycolytic capacity might
be nearly 30 kcal. min~! and the aerobic pathway may
generate anywhere from 10 to 20 kcal -min~!. The ca-
pacity of the immediate and glycolytic energy supplies
change by only 10-20% as a result of training but can
be affected by differences in muscle mass and fiber type
distribution. Aerobic capacity seems to be the most
variable and the most “trainable,” though the impor-
tance of genetics is recognized here as well. Inherited
traits and training status might allow for as much as
a 50-100% difference among the population in the
summated aerobic output capacity of the TCA cycle.

to the 200-m event, the decline in instantaneous ve-

freestyle is swum at an average velocity that is 20-25%
slower than the 100-m freestyle or, about 1.8 m-s-!
(Fig. 1.8). The point to be made here is that metabolic
power requirements are related to swim velocity, as-
suming that changes in mechanical efficiency are not
occurring.

is not linear, as swim events become longer the neces-

in sustained swim velocity, rather than the other way
round.

Velocity vs. power

Because of the nature of the relationship between
swim velocity and resultant water resistance (or drag),
the power required to swim at any given velocity in-
creases at a rate that is somewhat greater than the
square of the velocity (Fig. 1.9). The converse is also

true, the faster the swim velocity, the greater is the
increase in the necessary power output. At the short-
est competitive distances then, swim velocity is great-
est and thus the instantaneous power requirement
is also greatest. Power output is so great that short
sprints can only be fueled by theimmediately available
phosphogens.

Because of the energetic capacities of the three
metabolic pathways, swim velocity declines in a
roughly linear fashion with the increasing event dis-
tance, and the power output needed to swim at this ve-
locity decreases at an even faster rate. Therefore, com-
pared to low velocities (or longer distances), at high
swim velocities a small decline in speed results in a
much greater decline in the energy needed to achieve
that speed. The loss of velocity as a swimmer fatigues
is buffered by the disproportionate decline in power
needed to sustain the reduced swim velocity. That is,
“backing off” a little bit at high swim velocities results
ina substantial savings from the perspective of energy
requirements. This may explain why sprint swimmers
rarely, if ever, negative split races.

The opposite perspective, however, is that the faster
someone swims the greater will be the necessary in-
crease in the rate of energy production to swim even
a little faster. At high swim velocities, the added ener-
getic cost of swimming 0.5 s faster (such as in a 50-m
freestyle) might be twice as great as the cost saved by
swimming 0.5 s slower. Coaches recognize through
experience that the faster the swimmer, the harder it
is for that swimmer to go faster still. To a great extent,
the basis for this observation lies within the metabolic
capacity of the muscle to generate energy and the re-
lationship between swim velocity and drag.

Because of these relationships, the ability to esti-
mate a swimmer’s maximal power output allows pre-
diction of that swimmer’s maximum swim velocity.
To get an idea of the actual power output required to
swim at any given velocity consider Fig. 1.9. This fig-
ure illustrates the relationship between a swimmer’s
ability to generate maximum power and their maxi-
mum swim velocity (independently measured during
a 15-m freestyle sprint). From this it is clear that power
output varies greatly among swimmers, as does maxi-
mum swim velocity.

Differences are related to the specific characteris-
tics of each swimmer’s physique and physiology, al-
though skill may also play a role in this relationship.
The better skilled swimmers can generate more veloc-
ity requiring less power, in part, because they swim
with less drag and use more power to generate effective
propulsion. Figure 1.9 alsodemonstrates howa limited
power output can influence maximum velocity. Power
output can be constrained by limited muscle mass,
muscle fiber recruitment pattern, fiber type and dis-
tribution, metabolic pathway enzyme concentration,
mitochondrial density and volume, and cardiovascu-
lar and pulmonary performance. The importance of
these factors changes as a function of event distance,
or rather duration, and average swim velocity.

Maximal aerobic capacity

One last topic is necessary to explore before any fur-
ther conclusions can be drawn concerning energy sub-
strates during swimming. Several lines of research have
suggested that the TCA cycle is at maximal capacity
(VOomax) during a 400-m race with a sustained all-
out effort. Events shorter than this may not be long
enough to allow the TCA cycle to attain maximal out-
put. Events longer than this are swum at lower swim
velocities and at Vozs that are at or below the necessary
threshold velocity. The definition of “threshold” used
here is a velocity at which physiological parameters
can be held steady and thus any given swim velocity
sustained for an extended period of time. If this is so,
then it should stand to reason that at the velocity of a
400-m swim, the energy contribution of the TCA cy-
cle is maximal. This does not mean that energy is not
being derived from other pathways as well. Because
of the low maximal power output of the TCA cycle
relative to the immediate and glycolytic pathways, at

least some portion of the energy contribution orig-
inates from anaerobic glycolysis (perhaps as little as
6% of the total or as much as 60% of the total, depend-
ing upon the level of fitness and other physiological
traits of the swimmer). For the high-level performer,
however, the 400-m event seems to be the distance at
which TCA cycle power output is maximized. This dis-
tance is used, therefore, when estimates of Vo2max are
obtained from swimmers.

Swimming at any velocity greater than that required
for 400-m (i.e., events of shorter duration) requires
greater contributions of glycolysis and the ATP-CP
system. The point to focus upon is this: the instanta-
neous power output required at swimming velocities
above that achieved in an even paced maximal 400 m
is greater than that which can be achieved via aero-
bic metabolism alone. Because of the time required to
fully accelerate this pathway, the 400 m is the short-
est event distance that elicits maximal aerobic power
output.

As mentioned previously, sprint swimming veloci-
ties over shorter distances, suchas 10 or 15 m, represent
the upper end of power output supported essentially
by the available phosphogen sources. Our two points
along the metabolic continuum then (the only two
which we are fairly sure of) are the all-out 10- or 15-m
sprint and the 400-m event.

The Swimgate test of
anaerobic power

Figure 1.10 illustrates three typical power output pro-
files of athletes performing a 30-s all-out effort. This
profile is similar to what is seen with running and can
be generated during a Wingate Test performed on a cy-
cle ergometer. Hence, the corresponding test for swim-
ming is called a Swimgate Test. The swimmer performs
a 30-s all-out effort in the water while attached to an
elastic tether. The athlete begins at a distance from
the wall that requires maximal force production and
attempts to sustain this effort throughout the 30 s.
Several interesting characteristics of this curve can be
noted. The first is that power output does not peak
immediately, but takes 5—7 s. The second is that re-
gardless of motivation or swim effort, power output
declines thereafter. Sprinters demonstrate, as might
be expected, a greater peak power output. They also

Energy systems as a function of

At the beginning of a short sprint, the energy required
to perform the work must necessarily be supported al-
most exclusively by immediate phosphogen sources.
The other two pathways require more time to gener-
ate significant power output. Because the combined
capacity of the glycolysis and TCA pathways is less
than the output of the immediately available phos-
phogens, maximum swim velocity must necessarily
be less at anything beyond this short distance. We will
now attempt to estimate the proportional contribu-
tions of the three energy pathways as a function of
exercise time.

At the start of a race (the first 5 s), or during a short,
all-out swim, the metabolic power output above thatof

energy sources. There is little contribution from either
glycolysis or aerobic metabolism. Using the measures
of mechanical power output as a basis, and estimates
of efficiency (about 25%), this represents a necessary
value of metabolic power output that is on the order of
500 W. This value is lower than that reported for run-
ners and cyclists, perhaps because the arms represent
the primary power for swimming while representinga
smaller muscle mass than the legs. In addition, swim-
mers do not work against gravity, rather they work
against the resistance of water. They do not support
their weight and most of the energy is directed toward
power for propulsion. Thus the forces generated by the
muscles are substantially less.

Power output is maximal at these initial swim ve-
locities but cannot be sustained for any length of
time. As illustrated in Fig. 1.10, both power output and
swim velocity begin to decline almost immediately.
Energy provided by the immediate sources (ATP and
CP) should be considered just that, immediate. The
rate of power output is limited only by the kinetics of
the reaction, the enzymes involved, and the availabil-
ity of the phosphogens, i.e., ATP, ADP, AMP, CP, and P;.

event is fueled by proportional contributions of ap-
proximately 40% ATP-CP, 55% glycolysis, and 5%TCA

By 30 s or so, the majority of the energy gener-
ated to sustain swimming is now from glycolysis. The
specific substrate is glucose coming from stored com-
plex carbohydrates located within the skeletal muscle,
i.e., muscle glycogen. Rather than being sustained by
anaerobic glycolysis, energy is increasingly supplied
via aerobic glycolysis.

After 45 s or so, there seems to be another shift
in substrate and power production. If the exercise
is sustained, a shift toward increased aerobic energy
production continues. But, as noted earlier, aerobic
metabolism requires nearly 90 s to reach maximal
power output. Training helps to move this transition
earlier by improving the delivery systems importantin
providing the substrates for aerobic metabolism. Nev-
ertheless, glycolysis continues to be important, albeit
not predominant, through events lasting as long as
10 or 15 min. In fact, aerobic glycolysis continues to
be an important pathway providing substrates to the
TCA cycle during events lasting several hours or more.

Energy systems 15

The major difference between short and long events is
in how the various products of glycolysis are metab-
olized. As the relative exercise intensity decreases (as
event duration increases), the products of glycolysis
are metabolized aerobically through the TCA cycle in
equilibrium with the rate at which they are produced.

Events lasting beyond 90 s can be considered depen-
dent upon aerobic metabolism. Glycolysis remains an
important early determinant and carbohydrates con-
tinue to represent the fuel source. But as swim velocity
declines and aerobic metabolism predominates, the
training plan needs to focus on developing aerobic ca-
pacity to a much greater extent. It is predicted from
metabolic traits that success at 400 m and beyond is
dependant upon aerobic capacity and that the 200-m
events (freestyle in particular) may be a “break point”
in this regard. There may be sprinters who can hold on
long enough to be successful 200 swimmers and there
maybe distance swimmers who can “swim down” and
also be successful in the 200 m. These two athletes
might be hypothesized to swim very different races.
The first might take it out at a high velocity and de-
pend upon a high anaerobic capacity to bring it back
while the second athlete might attempt to even split
the race and rely on being able to come back when
aerobic metabolism supplies the majority of energy. It
would further be hypothesized that the optimal train-
ing for these athletes should be different. The mistake
might be to try and improve the endurance of the
sprinter through sustained, short-rest work. It would
be expected that while their ability to “come back”
might improve, the swimmer’s maximal power output
might be compromised to the extent that their shorter
sprint events may suffer and their overall 200 m time
may improve very little. The coach may decide that the
swimmer swam a “better” race because of the smaller
differential between halves, but there may be little to
no improvement in overall time.

Significance of the lactate curve

Aconsiderable amount of information is known about
blood lactate concentrations during and following ex-
ercise. First, a blood lactic acid profile can be described
for each swimmer. This profile represents how blood
lactate changes as a function of exercise intensity.

However, as the individual becomes trained the OBLA

contributions, can be found in a recent publication by
Olbrecht (2000).

The role of genetics

We must not overlook the importance of genetics in
swim performance. Sprinters, because of their pre-
dominant fast twitch glycolytic muscle fiber type, can
produce more lactic acid than can most endurance
athletes. This is in part because of training programs,
but also due in part to genetic factors. Fiber type dis-
tribution, largely an inherited trait, plays a role in the
balance between lactic acid uptake and lactate produc-
tion. Sprinters have a lesser capacity to clear lactate
and a greater capacity to produce it in part because of
their fast twitch fiber types. While lactate uptake ap-
pears to be trainable, lactate production rates seem less
adaptable. Because there is little evidence linking lac-
tic acid per se to muscular fatigue, the significance of
high lactic acid levels in the blood is difficult to inter-
pret. Once again, it is the ability to buffer the proton
(H+) produced when lactic acid dissociates to lactate
that may limit the continued production of muscu-
lar force at high rates of muscular contraction, rather
than the existence of lactic acid per se.

Lactate and training

OBLA has been shown to represent a good predictor of
endurance performance or rather endurance poten-
tial. The literature suggests that OBLA is superior to
VoOomax as a predictor of performance and can be used
to identify the running or swimming velocity, which
is close to race pace (Haberg & Coyle 1983; Fohrenbach
et al. 1987; Fay et al. 1989; Harrison et al. 1992). This
suggests that if OBLA can be elevated, training and
racing pace can be elevated as well. Improvements
in OBLA velocity have also been associated with
adaptations in skeletal muscle (Sjodin et al. 1982).
It can be inferred, then, that kicking drills might be

The purpose of swim test sets such as the T30 or T20,

as OBLA, plotted against swim velocity or exercise in-

Effects of training on the
energy pathways

The effect of training, and the purpose of training, par-
ticularly during the early stages of the annual training
plan, is primarily toincreasethe capacity of the aerobic
pathway. Aerobic sets act to improve the rate at which
lactic acid can be cleared. Thus, early season aerobic

a higher cumulative metabolic power output. The gly-
colytic capacity is also capable of increasing 20-50%
depending upon the inherent characteristics of the
athlete and their training regime.

Taking a closer look at the trainability of the imme-
diate energy supply, there is not much to be said. ATP
and CP concentrations do not seem to change appre-
ciably with training. Training programs, which incor-
porate short bursts of very high intensity exercise, do
not show significant effects beyond what might be ex-
pected with increased muscle mass. The enzyme cre-
atine kinase catalyzing the reaction between ATP and
CP is shown to increase in concentration with sprint
training. Dietary regimens may act to increase CP lev-
els but intake must be at supraphysiological levels.
Concern has been expressed by some trainers about
the potential effect this may have upon water balance
and kidney function.

It then appears that power output due to glycoly-
sis is dependent upon two factors similar to that of
the immediate phosphogen sources: enzyme concen-
tration and reactant availability. With swim training,
both variables appear to increase. Greater glycolytic
enzyme concentrations will act to increase maximal
glycolytic capacity while increased substrate content
will increase prolonged exercise endurance.

Finally, endurance training for events lasting be-
yond 3 or 4 min should be centered upon improving
the threshold velocity rather than increasing Vozmax
per se. The really great endurance performers will have
both traits: a high Voomax and a high threshold. The
route leading toward these outcomes is prolonged,
over-distance sets and short rest, sub-threshold sets of
relatively high distances per set.

Energy pathways during a
swim workout

Short, repetitive bouts of exercise at high intensity can
deplete muscle fiber glycogen within 10-15 min. In-
terval bouts can also rapidly deplete glycogen stores
in fast twitch fibers within 20-30 min. Prolonged sus-

deplete carbohydrate stores. Exactly when this occurs

well-trained, well-fed athlete. When athletes do not
consume enough carbohydrates in their diet, swim
performance is compromised. Carbohydrates are de-
pleted and declines in performance may be evident as
the weekly training plan progresses.

Conclusions

In conclusion, the following points relative to the en-
ergy pathways have been addressed. ATP is the ulti-
mate energy source used by the cells to do useful work.
ATP cannot be stored to any significant extent, thus
most swim performances are determined not by how
much ATP exists at the beginning of the race, but by
how fast ATP can be regenerated during the race! The
relative contribution of the energy pathways is a func-
tion of the intensity of the exercise bout. Short, max-
imal efforts lasting less than 10 s are powered by the
immediate phosphogen sources: ATP, ADP, and CP.

For events lasting longer than a few seconds, the
rate at which ATP can be generated is, in part, a func-
tion of the availability of substrates. Depending upon
the nature of the training, the specific cellular traits of
the swimmer, the swimmer’s diet, and the swim event
targeted, performance can be enhanced by effecting
adaptations that accelerate the rate at which energy,
in the form of ATP, can be generated. Alternatively, per-
formance can be improved by keeping substrate levels
adequate to meet energy demands and by maintaining
the general cellular environment in an optimal status
that allows sustained high rates of metabolism.

Lactic acid production is not dependent upona gen-
eral lack of oxygen within the body. Tissues such as
slow twitch fibers and the heart can consume lactate
as a fuel substrate. Perhaps as much as 80% of the lac-
tate produced during exercise is metabolized during
the same exercise bout or recovery from it. Lactic acid
per se has not been shown to be a cause of fatigue and
in fact is a convenient, available source of potential
energy during exercise. Lactic acid accumulates only
when the rate at which it is being produced becomes
greater than the rate at which it is consumed.

Aerobic metabolism sustains exercise beyond a
minute or so in duration. Improvements in aero-
bic metabolism may enhance performance in longer
events and provide an improved rate of recovery for
swimmers specializing in short events.

Chapter 2 will introduce the “delivery” systems that
exist in support of the cellular pathways for cellular
energy production, and Chapter 3 details the specific
skeletal muscle traits within which the mechanisms
that represent the means of generating propulsion in
swimming exist. In Chapter 8 we will integrate this
information and illustrate how these concepts can be
applied toward developing a training plan for the com-
petitive swimmer.

Physiological models—A contemporary approach, by
David Pyne

The classic model of energy systems evolved over the last 30
or 40 years. However the results of recent scientific investiga-
tion combined with practical experience suggest components of
this model of fatigue have significant limitations and should be
revised, The widely held but somewhat simplistic idea that fa-
tigue develops only when the capacity of the cardiovascular sys-
tems to provide oxygen to the exercising muscles falls behind the
demand, and thereby inducing anaerobic metabolism, is being
challenged. Noakes (2000) cites four main limitations of the tra-
ditional energy systems model: (i) the heart and not the skeletal
muscles would be affected first by anaerobiosis, (ii) no study has
definitively established the presence of anaerobiosis and hypoxia
in skeletal muscle during maximal exercise, (iii) the model is un-
able to explain why fatigue ensues during prolonged exercise, al
altitude, and in hat conditions, and (iv) cardiorespiratory (maxi-
mal oxygen uptake) and metabolic (lactate threshold) measures
are only modest predictors of performance. In practice, the expe-
rience of swimming coaches and scientists would lend particular
support to the latter two limitations (iii, iv) identified by Noakes.

To overcome these limitations Noakes (2000) proposed a new
physiological model to explain the complicated phenomena of
exercise performance. This revised model consists of the origi-
nal cardiovascular/anaerobic model and four additional models
that regulate short duration, maximal, or prolonged submaximal
exercise: (i) the cardiovascular/anaerobic model, (ii) energy sup-
ply/energy depletion model, (iii) the muscle recruitment (central
fatigue)/muscle power model, (iv) the biomechanical model, and
(v) the psychological/motivational model. This revised approach
and the concept of integrated modeling is appealing on both
theoretical and practical terms. Swimming coaches and athletes
understand intuitively that swim performance is multifactorial in
nature and the result of a complex overlay of many physical and
psychological factors. The evolution of new models of perfor-
mance (such as that proposed by Noakes) will challenge coaches
to devise new and improved ways of preparing swimmers to
perform well.

Evolutionary ideas

The model of sport performance that we are working
from supposes that the limits to swim performance
are multiple and complex. It further proposes that the
causes of fatigue are multiple and that the specific fac-
tors that allow outstanding performance are depen-
dent upon the nature of the specific event. One con-
clusion from our discussion in Chapter 1 on energy
systems is that the respiratory chain, the transport of
oxygen from room air to the mitochondria, may be
a limiting factor to performance in events that last
beyond several minutes. And yet, the specific limit
to aerobic metabolism might be shared across all of
the possible parameters that contribute to the respi-
ratory chain rather than any one single parameter
(Fig. 2.1).

From the perspective of training theory and an
explanation of the underlying physiological mech-
anisms that confer performance, several concepts
need to be considered. The first topic pertains to
“symmorphosis,” a viable concept to consider in this
context and one that is gaining wide acceptance by
physiologists.

Symmorphosis

Symmorphosis supposes that within a biological or-
ganism, itis difficult (if not impossible) to evolve phys-
iological systems that are limitless in capacity relative
to the capacities of other systems in the body. The
design of the components in a healthy physiological

20

system is such that it matches the components quanti-
tatively to the functional demands placed upon them.
In simple words, current theory suggests that there is
no single limiting factor to cardiorespiratory perfor-
mance, just as no physiological trait can be shown to
havea limitless “reserve.” Evolution ofa trait such that
it exists widely in a population requires many thou-
sands of years and some selective advantage. There is
no way to maintain a trait, from the evolutionary per-
spective, if it has no adaptive advantage. That is, ifa
trait is never exploited as an adaptive advantage, there
is no way this trait can be maintained within the gene
pool. There are no “limitless” systems.

Because of this, a negative change in the capacity of
any specific link in the chain, more likely than not, will
subsequently act to limit performance. For example,
restricted ventilation because of asthma will cause per-
formance to suffer in a meet and in swim practice. This
does not necessarily mean that ventilation is the lim-
iting factor. Increased ventilation (above normal val-
ues) will not necessarily enhance performance because
this improvement does not necessarily influence any
of the other processes in the oxygen transport chain
that also act to limit performance. Matched capaci-
ties of the various important physiological processes
seem to exist. It now appears to physiologists that all
components of a system have about the same maxi-
mal ability, “enough but not too much,” to perform
intensive exercise. All systems reach their maximum
capacity at about the same time in a progressively
increasing work bout.

Symmorphosis can be expanded to suppose that
the adaptations to intensive swim training should be

Weak link theory

The competing hypothesis (and much older theory)
suggests that one physiological system may fail much
sooner than any of the others and training should
specifically focus on this “fatal” weakness. For lack of
a more sophisticated term, we will call this the “weak
link” theory. Central to this theory is the idea that
certain physiological systems have measurable and
considerable reserves and others do not. A reserve is
defined as the capacity of any given component—
cardiac, vascular, pulmonary, etc—above that which
is required during maximal exercise. In this theory,
when an athlete is engaged in an intensive exercise
bout, his or her limit is set by the “weakest link,” or
rather that system with the smallest reserve. When the
capacity of the system with the smallest reserve is ex-
hausted, the ability to continue to exercise, or rather
the ability to increase or sustain exercise, no longer

Adaptations to training

It might be helpful to separate morphological or struc-
tural adaptations to training from those that are more
functional in nature. When aswimmer begins totrain,
adaptations occur within the various cells, tissues, and
systems. These adaptations allow the body to accom-
modate to the metabolic stress that swim training rep-
resents. Some of these adaptations are functional in
nature and are outcome variables initiated at the bio-
chemical or cellular level. Some are morphological
or structural at the cellular, tissue, or systems level.
Functional changes may be considered outcome vari-
ables, such as Voomax and cardiac output. The struc-
tural adaptations are, in theory, the mechanisms by
which the functional changes occur. Important struc-
tural parameters include heart chamber size, erythro-
cyte volume, lung surface area, and mitochondrial vol-
ume. The importance of mitochondrial volume as a
potential contributor to performance was emphasized
in Chapter 1. The other three, heart size, erythrocyte
volume, and lung surface area, will be dealt with in
greater detail in this chapter. The important idea is

that a few key structural improvements lead to impor-
tant functional outcomes.

Regardless of the nature of the adaptations to swim
training, it is clear that in some cases it is the individ-
ual bout of exercise that represents the stimulus for
adaptation and in other cases it is the cumulative ef-
fect of multiple swim training bouts. It is evident that
training effects cannot be stored. The effects are a re-
sult of what the athlete did rather than what he or she
used to do. However, once a trait has reached its ca-
pacity to change, there may be a difference between
the frequency of training stimulus needed to improve
the trait versus the frequency needed to maintain the
trait. This is not news.

It isalsoapparent that many of the training-induced
physiological changes occur over considerable time
rather than overnight. It is also clear that the nature
of the stimulus must be specific, appropriate, and pro-
gressive in order for the correct training adaptations to
occur. These are well-known tenets of classic training
theory—specificity, progression, and adaptation. At
the end of the season, the only appropriate structural
and functional training adaptations are those that will
ultimately lead to improved performance in the indi-
vidual’s targeted event.

It may be, however, that during the swim season,
certain outcomes of training are much more gen-
eral in nature and not specific to the competitive
event per se. One desirable functional outcome that
may only indirectly affect sprint performance, for ex-
ample, may be quicker recovery from swim compe-
tition. Rapid recovery is important, not only from
the perspective of being able to withstand subse-
quent intensive training, but for being able to com-
pete optimally in more than one event per meet. It
may be critical for a swimmer to be able to compete
well in the morning preliminaries as well as in the
evening’s finals. Certain structural training responses
may also reduce the risk of injury that might sub-
sequently prevent swimmers from performing. The
coach needs to keep all of these outcomes in mind
when developing an annual swim training plan: be-
ing able to recover quickly, remaining injury-free, and
being able to perform the target competitive event
optimally.

The nature and basis of early season training is lar-

An example might be appropriate in terms of

cle blood flow is seen as an additional limiting factor
in sustained power output. Theoretically, the distance
between the capillary and the mitochondria is an ad-
ditional potentially limiting factor, as this distance
will affect the rate of the diffusion of oxygen into the
cells.

It is somewhat difficult to determine which occurs

it is important that the swimmer receives proper nu-

not be able to change fiber type, they can insure that
adaptive responses are optimal by preaching good nu-

One would suppose, therefore, that the type of train-
ing bouts prescribed during the preseason and early
season would be those that act to favor aerobic de-
velopment. These improvements mirror the improve-
ments in the biochemical pathways responsible for
aerobic metabolism and those that stimulate an in-
crease in cardiac performance, pulmonary function,
and tissue vascularity. We will now look at some of
these individual adaptations more closely.

The heart

It is common to consider the human heart as being
functionally two hearts, a systemic or left heart and
a pulmonary or right heart. The volume demands
placed upon the two hearts are similar. When the left
heart is required to pump 15 1 of blood a minute, the
right heart must do so as well because the entire circu-
lation reflects that of a closed system.

The pressure challenges that the two hearts must
meet, however, are very different. The left heart
must be able to generate pressures well in excess of
200 mmHg, depending upon the flow and resistance

The amount of blood pumped per unit time is re-

Heart size

Johnny Weissmuller, the great Olympian of the early
twentieth century, correctly concluded that one of the
important traits of a champion swimmer is a large
heart. What exactly does “large heart” mean, and how
does having a large heart aid performance? Heart size
can refer to “chamber size” as well as myocardial thick-
ness. The first reflects the heart’s ability to generate
flow (volume per unit time) and the second to over-
come resistance. Not surprisingly, the evidence sug-
gests that swimmers tend to show both responses to
swim training, most likely as a result of the extensive
dryland training that is commonly prescribed today
and the extensive volume load the swimmers com-
plete while training in the water.

Preload

When athletes train, the characteristics of the train-
ing will influence the adaptive responses of the heart.
If the athlete is primarily engaged in prolonged, low-
intensity exercise, the cardiac adaptations will be
a gradual increase in the size of the chambers of
the heart, without much change in the thickness of
the heart walls. The dimensions of the heart cham-
bers increase in response to stretch or tension. A
part of this dimensional increase is due to expanded
blood volume. Increased blood volume affects the
filling volume during diastole, which then acts to
increase stroke volume. Studies have shown that ex-
perimental increases or decreases in blood volume re-
sult in proportional increases and decreases in stroke
volume.

Chamber size affects the volume of the blood that
can be pumped with each beat (stroke volume). It is
also true, however, that the volume within the cham-
ber will subsequently affect the myocardial contrac-
tion through what is known as the Frank-Starling
mechanism. Because swimmers are in the prone

or supine position while swimming, venous return
(blood returning to the heart in the veins) is enhanced
as a result of the elimination of the effects of gravity.
Increased preload by increased diastolic filling results
in stronger myocardial contraction. Stroke volume in-
creases because of increased filling and simultaneously
increased emptying.

The heart of an endurance swimmer can be argued
to be more efficient when compared on a “metabolic
cost per volume of blood pumped per unit time” ba-
sis because heart rate and mean arterial pressure are
lower at any given exercise intensity. Endurance swim
training increases the volume of blood pumped and
does so without affecting blood pressure to any great
extent. Because the work of the heart can be estimated
by multiplying the heart rate by systolic pressure, a re-
duction in pressure coupled with a slower heart rate
means less myocardial work per unit time at a given
exercise intensity.

Structural volume changes in the ventricular walls
occur as a result of adding myofibrils—in series—to
the myocardial cells. In response to chronically altered
demands, ventricular size increases, leading to an in-
crease in maximal stroke volume as well as maximal
cardiac output. Sedentary individuals exhibit maxi-
mal stroke volumes of approximately 135 ml -beat~!,
while values reported for highly trained athletes ap-
proach 200 ml-beat~'. The importance of this dif-
ference cannot be overstressed. From rest to maximal
exercise, then, the athlete is able to increase stroke
volume by more than 100 ml - beat~! as compared to
rest, while the sedentary individual can only increase
stroke volume by about 50 ml - beat~!. This represents
a tremendous advantage in terms of the amount of
blood that can be pumped in a given amount of time.
Research has shown that stroke volume increases ac-
count fora large portion of the increase in oxygen con-
sumption seen with training.

There is very little evidence to suggest that heart
chamber size is an inherited trait. Children show little
dimensional variation and twin studies do not sup-
port the conclusion of any significant genetic control.
It has been suggested that the myocardial sac, the fi-
brous sheath that surrounds the heart, represents the
limit for expanding chamber size. What ultimately de-
termines myocardial sac volume and to what extent it
can be increased after physical maturity remain to be
identified.

Afterload

Swimming does not induce systolic blood pressures as
high as that seen during running or resistance train-
ing. The resistance to ventricular emptying, largely
represented by mean arterial pressure, is referred to
as “afterload.” Lower afterload while swimming is
thought to exist despite the observation that exercise
which requires upper body musculature tends to result
in higher pressures than similar exercise using larger
lower body muscles. This is because the forces gener-
ated are low and swimmers are in the prone or supine
positions. In this regard, little attention has been fo-
cused upon the habit of swimmers to “catch breath.”
Swimmers tend to gasp a quick inhalation and then
exhale in a controlled, prolonged fashion (relative to
inhalation time). This might result in a change to the
vascular dynamics of the right heart by affecting right
heart afterload. Because of measurement difficulties,
however, the availability of data on the pulmonary ar-
terial blood pressure of swimmers while swimming is
limited.

Cardiac output

Stroke volume has been suggested to plateau with an
increase in exercise intensity. The plateau occurs be-
tween 50 and 60% of maximal exercise during up-
right exercise. Further increases in cardiac output
are then thought to be a result of increases in heart
rate. Recent evidence in athletes suggests that stroke
volume may not plateau in the highly trained and
may indeed increase up until maximum exercise. This
may partially account for the increased cardiac out-
put observed in the highly trained endurance ath-
letes and be permissive to the increased rate of aerobic
metabolism.

Early research on the effects of training on the heart
concluded that exercise lasting 2~5 min in duration
was effective as a means to increase heart chamber vol-
ume and thus stroke volume. Interestingly, the focus
of much of this research was on the interval of rest
that was optimal rather than the interval of exercise
that was best. The conclusion of this work seemed to
suggest that rest intervals allowing heart rate to return
to values around 120 beats-min~! were most effec-
tive in producing favorable cardiac adaptations. The
specific rest interval was a function of the athletes’

responses rather than a set time interval. As the ath-
letes increased their level of fitness, the rest interval
shortened to accommodate the improvements in re-
covery rate. While this is a very old concept dating
back to the early 1900s, there have recently been sug-
gestions of a return to this “recovery based” training
model as a more effective means to bring about posi-
tive individualistic adaptive training responses.

What is the advantage of the heart being able
to pump more blood? Some researchers believe that
skeletal muscle blood flow is actually the most impor-
tant limit to aerobic metabolism. If blood flow to the
muscles is mechanically increased beyond its natural
limit, it has been shown in isolated muscle that its aer-
obic capacity can be elevated. On the whole organism
level, there is a very high correlation between aerobic
capacity and the maximal volume of blood the heart
can pump in a minute. Exercise in the heat, which di-
verts blood flow to the skin for thermoregulatory pur-
poses, is shown to depress aerobic capacity. It has even
been suggested that the ventilatory muscles compete
with the locomotor muscles during heavy exerciseand
effectively compete for a portion of the limited cardiac
output. Maximal cardiac output, thus, may be the sin-
gle best predictor of maximal aerobic capacity,

While heart rate can modulate cardiac output, dif-
ferences in stroke volume play the more significant
role during intensive exercise. Swimmers hoping to
compete in the longer competitive events, such as the
400-m events and beyond, require sustained high rates
of metabolism such that a high aerobic capacity is
certainly an advantage, if not a requirement. Thus,
cardiac output may be a permissive trait that allows
for a high aerobic capacity and thus exceptional en-
durance performance. Cardiac output should be con-
sidered a central, functional limitation to maximal
aerobic metabolism. Sprinters have much less need
and much less capacity for aerobic adaptations. Thus,
aerobic capacity becomes only of secondary impor-
tance to sprint performance, serving primarily as a
means of improving recovery time.

Substrate delivery

The current view is that during exercise, both carbo-
hydrate and lipid transport from the capillary into the
muscle cells reach a maximal rate at moderate exer-
cise intensities. Beyond these modest levels, then, the

time! Researchers have shown that it takes minimally
6-8 weeks of exercise to result in the majority of the
increase in the desired aerobic training responses.

Heart rate

Maximal heart rates are not observed to be altered to
any great extent by training. Maximal heart rates vary
somewhat from day to day, are individualistic, and par-
tially related to inherited traits. Maximum heart rate
is a function of the biophysical constraints imposed
by the mechanisms that determine firing rates of ex-
citable tissues. There is a refractory period following
each heart beat during which the various ions need
to be concentrated appropriately across the various
cell membranes. In addition, the time required by the
spread of the action potential across the myocardium
partners to limit the maximal heart rate. Finally, there
is a certain amount of time needed for ventricular fill-
ing. As hearts approach and exceed 200 beats - min-!,
the end diastolic volume becomes less, resulting in
no significant advantage in terms of further increases
in cardiac output. Maximal values for mature swim-
mers range from 185 beats- min~! to values over 200,
Smaller, younger swimmers tend to have higher heart
rates, possibly as a function of a smaller heart mass and
a shorter conduction distance.

The results of cross-sectional observations consis-
tently show a decline in maximal heart rate with in-
creasing age. However, this relationship might vary
as a function of lifestyle. Master swimmers who have
maintained intensive, daily habitual physical activity
tend to show less decline with age when compared
to the age-related changes reported for the general
population.

As a swimmer becomes better conditioned, early
morning, resting heart rate is observed to decline.
The mechanism is referred to as “parasympathetic
overtone” and has a biophysical mechanism. Acetyl-
choline released at the end plates of the vagus nerve
acts to slow the spontaneous firing rate of the pace-
maker cells of the SA node. Resting heart rates less

conditioned endurance athletes. Increases in early
morning heart rate may be an early symptom of an in-
ability to adequately recover from the preceding work-

The rise in heart rate reflects the involvement of the
sympathetic nervous system in response to the stress
imposed by training.

Heart rate has been used for many years as an index
of exercise intensity. Individual differences in heart
rate and daily fluctuations make its use somewhat of
an art rather than a science. The “truthfulness” of the
athlete, meaning the accuracy of self-reported postex-
ercise heart rates, may also limit the usefulness of heart
tate as a measure of relative exercise intensity. Daily
fluctuations may be in the 2-3 beats. min”! range at
any given exercise intensity. When beats are counted
per 10s, asis usually done, a missed beat (or added beat)
will result in an additional 6-beat difference when re-
ported as a minute value. The rapid postexercise de-
cline in heart rate also may influence the estimated
exercise heart rate. A range of heart rate values with a
fairly broad spread is thus appropriate.

The blood

The concentration of hemoglobin within the blood
plays a leading role in transport of gases to and from
the active tissues. As noted earlier, blood volume ex-
pansion has a direct mechanical effect upon stroke
volume through increased venous filling and the
Frank-Starling effect. Blood volume expansion may
also impact venous compliance and central venous
pressure, acting in concert to assist right heart venous
return. Increases in venous return represent equiva-
lent increases in cardiac output.

The increase in blood volume may additionally act
as a buffer against reductions in cardiac performance
because of a loss of vascular volume resulting from
sweating. Although swimmers are not conscious of
it, sweating occurs during swim training, particularly
when water temperatures are high. Coaches should be
conscious of this and cognizant of scenarios in which
the athletes can become dehydrated or hypohydrated.
Asimple pre- to post-workout weight comparison, par-
ticularly when training in warm water above 80°F, will
demonstrate the magnitude of this effect.

Just as important as the volume increases are the
increases in the ability of the blood to carry oxygen.
This is the second “structural” adaptation (in addition
to heart chamber size) that acts to enhance aerobic

metabolism. Increased O2-carrying capacity will have
a proportional increase in the transport of oxygen
to the periphery. The key component of this is the
complex molecule hemoglobin and its capacity to re-
versibly bind to oxygen.

It is evident that changes in the concentration of
hemoglobin ({Hb]) result in proportional changes in
O2 delivered to the peripheral tissues. Decreases in
the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin (arterial
saturation), such as those caused by altitude (hypo-
baric hypoxia), lung disease (hypoventilation, diffu-
sion limitation, or ventilation/perfusion mismatch),
or perhaps most importantly, smoking cigarettes (an
increase in carboxyhemoglobin), will cause decreases
in oxygen transport that are directly proportional to
the extent of arterial saturation. Any factor that lowers
Oodelivery or the partial pressure of Oz in the arterial
blood will subsequently limit work done by limiting
oxygen transport and thus aerobic power output.

Training responses

The structural variables capable of increasing in re-
sponse to exercise are few and probably limited to in-
creases in stroke volume and [Hb]. The usual pattern
with training is a rapid plasma volume expansion with
little effective increase in [Hb]. Endurance-trained ath-
letes are observed to express “pseudoanemia” as a re-
sult. Nevertheless, athletes participating in extensive
training should be monitored for adequate iron intake
and body iron stores.

Hemoglobin production

Poor nutrition can impact hemoglobin production
and adversely affect the replacement of aging erythro-
cytes. Because mature erythrocytes do not contain a
nucleus or DNA, they have a finite viability on the or-
der of 120 days. The complexity of hemoglobin is such
that poor nutrition can affect hemoglobin production
in several ways. The common outcome is anemia and
a decline in total erythrocyte volume. The importance
of this cannot be overstated and the routine screening
of elite performers as a means of diagnosis and preven-
tion is warranted.

general, does not support altitude training as an ef-

is that altitude has not necessarily been shown to

The physiologists counter that the risks are associated
with limited peripheral adaptations because the alti-

account for the limited oxygen transport. Although
there has been recent research presented upon a “live
high, train low” training regime for endurance run-
ners, convincing evidence is limited and the practi-
cality for swimming is questioned.

The lung

There do not appear to be many structural changes
that specifically occur in the lung in response to in-
tensive training. This has led to the suggestion that the
lung may be “built in excess” to accommodate heavy
exercise. Other training-induced improvements in the
more plastic elements of the oxygen transport chain
simply “catch up” to the lungs. The muscles respon-
sible for ventilation, however, certainly increase their
endurance, similar to the locomotive muscles used for
swimming. There is only limited evidence for other
training-induced adaptations.

Similar to athletes in other sports, the lungs of swim-
mers have not been shown to grow larger in response
to training when normal growth and development are
accounted for. The surface area for gas exchange in the
lung is thus fixed once adult stature is attained. Nev-
ertheless, swimmers have been reported to have lungs
that are comparatively larger than age- and height-
matched sedentary controls. It has not been possi-
ble to determine if this is an adaptation to prolonged
swim training or perhaps a selective trait that allows for
swimming success. Cross-sectional research has sim-
ply shown that in contrast to other highly trained
athletes, when matched for height, swimmers have

implications, it is uncertain if this is an advantage to
the swimmer as far as gas exchange is concerned, or
perhaps the larger volume of gas in the chest simply
improves buoyancy.

The lungs represent the interface between the envi-
ronment and the blood inside the vasculature. They
have evolved as an efficient gas-exchange surface. In
a healthy lung, it takes less than a third of a second
for the blood returning from the active tissues to equi-
librate with the gases in the lung. At rest, the transit
time of blood in the lung approximates three quar-
ters of a second. Thus, there is plenty of “exchange”
time to spare. This reserve is reduced during exercise
and the extent of the decline in transit time is related
to maximal cardiac output. Recent research suggests
that in highly trained runners, cardiac output may be
so great that the time available for complete equili-
bration in the lung may be inadequate. This sets upa
secondary diffusion limitation such that arterial oxy-
genation may be less than normal during very heavy
work. Currently, there is no evidence showing similar
limitations in swimmers.

The swimmer’s lung

Interestingly, enhanced pulmonary diffusion capac-
ities have been demonstrated in swimmers at rest as
well as during exercise. It is unclear if this is related
to the larger area for gas exchange, more even gas ex-
change within the lung, or due to some other adap-
tation. Diffusion capacity for O2 across the alveolar—
capillary membrane is determined by the following
structural parameters: alveolar and capillary surface
area, the thickness of the membrane and plasma layer
separating the erythrocyte from the endothelium, and
pulmonary capillary blood volume.

The observation of greater diffusion capacity in
swimmers is consistent even when diffusion capacity
is adjusted for body size and total lung capacity. It has
been suggested that alveolar hypertrophy or hyperpla-
sia may account for the differences observed, yet no
direct evidence exists for either of these two possibili-
ties in swimmers. There exists limited, yet intriguing,
evidence for dysanaptic growth in the lung of swim-
mers favoring increases in alveolar mass over increases
in growth within the conducting zones of the lung.

A further hypothesis pertaining to the differences

the early intensive training that swimmers perform
is responsible for the observed pulmonary adapta-
tions. The literature consistently shows that success-
ful swimmers begin training, on the average, some-
where between 8 and 9 years of age. This compares to
data obtained from athletes in other sports that show
most athletes begin training in an organized fashion
between 14 and 15 years of age. There is no direct evi-
dence to support early training as the cause of the pul-
monary differences discussed, but at least one training
study using immature rats suggests that early training
might be causal in nature to lung adaptations observed
in competitive swimmers.

Ventilation

The ventilatory muscles of the chest and the di-
aphragm act to keep the lung ventilated in a tightly
coordinated manner in response to changes in blood
gases. The goal is to keep the composition of gas in
the lung constant (and thus arterial gases constant)
regardless of the metabolism of the tissues. If more
Oy is removed from the lung gas by the blood, then
more air must be ventilated to keep the gas composi-
tion in the lung constant. That is not to imply that
lung gases are monitored by the central nervous sys-
tem, although this has been proposed at various times
in history. It simply is meant to imply how tightly the
system is regulated.

Ventilation is controlled such that as exercise inten-
sity increases, pulmonary ventilation increases pro-
portional to the intensity of exercise. As exercise be-
comes more intense, however, there exists an intensity
beyond which ventilation increases at an even greater
rate. While this has been described for runners and cy-
clists, the process is much more complicated in swim-
mers because of their activity taking place in the water.
The importance of this increase is severalfold.

First, the significance of the increase is related to
concurrent increases in cardiac output. Because venti-
lation can increase toa greater extent than cardiac out-
put, the ratio of the two increases as exercise intensity
increases. The outcome of this is an increase in alve-
olar oxygen partial pressure, lower alveolar CO2, and
a more favorable environment for diffusion. Because
swimmers exercise in the prone or supine position, it
is also suggested that the postural effects upon blood
flow in the lung might not exist, resulting in more

homogeneous ventilation versus perfusion match
from the base to the apex of the lung. Both mecha-
nisms would act to insure that arterial saturation is
maintained during intensive exercise.

Second, with the increase in ventilation being pro-
portionally greater than the increase in metabolism,
there is an increase in the elimination of CO2 from
the tissues and lung. Because of the way in which CO,
is transported from the tissues, increased ventilation
will act to buffer the changes in acidity by the elimi-
nation of COz in the lung.

With the possible exception of the backstroke, ven-
tilation during swimming requires an artificial breath-
ing pattern in the sense that breathing is restricted by
elements demanded by stroke mechanics. Swimmers
might therefore be described as using an “obligatory
controlled frequency breathing” pattern. The breath-
ing frequency of a swimmer is “entrained” to the pull
frequency of the various strokes. The swimmer uncon-
sciously regulates ventilatory volumes by increasing
the size of each breath (tidal volume) or by increas-
ing the breathing frequency through increased stroke
tempo. This happens because swimmers can breathe
only when their faces are in a position to do so. Recent
evidence proposes that swimmers exhibit similar pul-
monary traits as runners who have engaged in specific
inspiratory muscle training.

Breathing patterns

One of the biggest problems coaches fight is young
swimmers who modify their stroke pattern in order to
accommodate their breathing. Rather than learning
to breathe when optimal (in terms of having the least
effect upon their propulsive movements), many be-
ginning swimmers allow breathing to completely dic-
tate their stroke characteristics. It is not uncommon
to see experienced swimmers even “overbreathe” or
take breaths because of habit, when no breath is actu-
ally needed. Swimmers breathe habitually according
to a rhythmic cadence that seems, at times, to over-
ride physiological cues. This is not common, or per-
haps not as obvious, during other modes of exercise,
but from the coach’s view, is a hard habit to break in
swimming.

Because of the difficulty of measuring breathing
parameters while actually swimming, not much is
known about the specifics of breathing strategies of

would seem logical particularly in the well-trained en-

Another interesting topic to consider is the effect
of bilateral breathing on blood gases. Bilateral breath-
ing refers to the swimmer breathing during the crawl
stroke in a pattern that alternates from side to side,
usually every third stroke. The swimmer might do this
as a means to keep an eye on the competition on ei-
ther side or to “even out” the pull pattern. In eight
strokes (right arm, left arm, etc.) a swimmer would
usually take four breaths. With bilateral breathing, a
swimmer might take only three or two. The decrease
in breathing frequency would be expected to be of lit-
tle physiological significance as long as the swimmer
can expand the size of each breath. Swimmers’ breath-
ing rates approximate 30 breaths. min~', which may
be less than half of that observed in athletes while
running at a quick training pace. It is possible for the
swimmer to increase breathing frequency by simply
increasing stroke tempo. A quicker stroke tempo is not
necessarily a bad thing unless the swimmer does so by
shortening each stroke. It would seem that for short
events, those where power output is most significant,
the swimmer might be better off simply breathing to
the normal or dominant side.

Breath holding

Breath holding has been an issue in swimming for
some time. In the present context, breath holding will
refer specifically to the cessation of breathing beyond
some usual breakpoint rather than breathing using
some slightly reduced frequency (hypoventilation).
Both breath holding and reduced frequency breath-
ing are used as training techniques in swimming. The
opposite practice of hyperventilating as a means to
blow off CO2 and thus increase the time for a breath
hold is also commonplace within competitive swim-
ming. This maneuver is relatively uncommon prior to

competitive events (except perhaps in the shortest
sprints) but all too common during practice sessions.

The problem with hyperventilation followed by a
breath hold lies in the rapid reduction in arterial O2
that occurs with intensive exercise while breath hold-
ing. Breathing is regulated in part by the partial pres-
sures of gases within the blood. When swimmers hy-
perventilate, they lower arterial COz2, thus eliminating
what is the strongest stimulus to breath. Hyperventi-
lation has little effect upon arterial O2, however, as
the blood is normally very nearly saturated with oxy-
gen. In response to breath holding then, the drive to
breathe has been eliminated and the athletes swim
underwater as far and as fast as they can. Because
metabolism is increased, large amounts of O2 are ex-
tracted from the blood ina single pass through the cir-
culatory system. If no breaths have been taken, upon
the blood’s return to the lung for gas exchange, no new
Oz is available, and thus blood O2 drops. The rapid
and drastic drop in O2 can act asa CNS depressant and
can rapidly cause a loss of consciousness. This occurs
because the brain has little to no metabolic ability to
produce energy without oxygen. The outcome may be
fatal if the swimmer passes out with no witnesses to
take him or her out of the water. Because breathing has
stopped owing to the depressed CNS activity, it may
be difficult to initiate breathing even if the swimmer
is now on the pool deck. This practice is extremely un-
wise and provides no benefit to the swimmer in terms
of desired training adaptations.

Controlled frequency breathing
(hypoxic training)

The idea behind reducing breathing frequency is re-
lated to the idea that exposure to lower Oz pressures
has a beneficial effect upon muscular adaptations.
It was hypothesized that capillary density, muscle
myoglobin levels, and mitochondrial mass may be
increased. In short, the idea was that controlled fre-
quency breathing (CFB, or intermittent breath hold-
ing) would result in training responses similar to those
seen during altitude exposure. The debate, however,
has always been whether or not CFB results in hy-
poxia or just hypercapnea (elevated COz2). Again, the
difficulty in determining which is the case is related
to the difficulty in collecting measurements in the
water. Given the recent data obtained from runners,

Snorkel training

A corollary to CFB is the use by swimmers of snorkels
while completing interval sets. The effect of a snorkel is
essentially enlargement of the volume of the anatomi-

for the swimmer to increase the depth of breathing to

Summary

Coaching success results from the induction of opti-
mal training adaptations in the existent physiologi-
cal makeup of the swimmer. The important param-
eters are numerous and can roughly be divided into
structural and functional variables. The functional
adaptations generally come as a result of underlying
structural improvements. Because the limitations to
the various “links in the oxygen transport chain” are
generally well matched, improvements are a result of

proportional changes in multiple steps rather than
improvements in one “weak link.” Stroke volume in-
creases as a result of morphological increases in ven-
tricular volume and blood volume. This leads to an
increase in cardiac output, which is highly correlated
with increases in aerobic capacity.

Mitochondrial metabolic activity ultimately sets
the demand for substrates and oxygen transport. This
is masked, however, by the limits set by the cardiopul-
monary system's ability to “deliver” during very in-
tensive, prolonged exercise. The ability to sustain in-
tensive exercise fueled largely by aerobic metabolism
is a function of the match between this high tis-
sue demand and the abilities of the delivery system
to meet them. For elite endurance performance this
match is everything. As we shall see in the next chap-
ter, however, for the sprinter success lies in the abil-
ity of the peripheral tissues to generate propulsive
power.

Introduction: sprint vs. endurance

The fastest swimmers in the water are clearly the 50-m
freestylers, while the swimmers with the most en-
durance, i.e., the ability to swim fast for a long time,
are the open-water “marathon” swimmers. In order
to sprint, the muscles of locomotion need to be able
to generate very high mechanical power outputs, but
only for short periods of time. In contrast, when swim-
ming distance events, the limb musculature must be
able to produce much less peak power, yet sustain rela-
tively moderate power output fora long period of time.
Sprinters must train so they can develop a high peak
muscular power output, while distance swimmers
train so they can sustain power output for extended
time periods with little muscular fatigue. Because the
events are different, do athletes prepare differently?
Are their physiological differences a result of how they
train? Or, are the athletes best suited for these contrast-
ing events genetically different?

The answer to these questions is that their abilities
are, in part, related to inherent traits exhibited by their
peripheral tissues, and, in part, to how the athletes pre-
pare for their respective competition. It is important to
recognize that regardless of how an athlete is trained,
there are inherent differences in the muscular char-
acteristics of talented sprinters and talented distance
swimmers. Other differences become apparent in re-
sponse to drastically different training programs, but
many of the essential characteristics common to great
sprinters or great endurance athletes are inherited.

Fundamental differences in specific traits of the pe-
ripheral tissues, primarily the skeletal muscles, effec-
tively discriminate between great sprinters and tal-
ented distance swimmers.

This chapter reviews the characteristics of skeletal
muscles and focuses upon those traits that convey spe-
cific sprint and endurance swim performance. The
later sections of this chapter will integrate this in-
formation with the energetic and cardiopulmonary
adaptations that must occur in order to provide
for elite swim performance in sprint and endurance
events.

Muscle anatomy

Anatomically, a muscle, such as the tricep, is com-
posed of distinct, visually discernable units referred
to as muscle fascicles (Fig. 3.1). The fascicles are fur-
ther composed of individual microscopic muscle cells,
synonymous with the term “muscle fiber.” Muscle
fibers are large multinucleated cells whose cytoplasm
contains contractile myofilaments, high-energy inter-
mediates, soluble proteins, enzymes for metabolism,
ribosomes, mitochondria, and substrates such as
glycogen and lipids. Muscle fibers are “excitable,” and
thus their membranes can propagate action potentials
and distribute ions selectively. Muscle fibers can vary
in length from a few millimeters to tens of centime-
ters. They express variable abilities to change certain
functional traits in response to external cues such as

limiting factors as far as contraction and relaxation are
concerned include several steps that are limited by the
availability of ATP. The rates at which these processes
can occur are related to the specific activity of the en-
zymes involved. The extent to which they can occur is
related to the metabolic capacity of the muscle fiber.
While the force produced and power generated by a
muscle are limited by the number of cross bridges that
can be formed (or volume of muscle recruited), the
ability to sustain a contraction may be limited by the
capacities of the metabolic pathways to supply ATP.

Muscular strength and power

Great performances in sprint swim events are related,
in part, to the ability of the muscles of locomotion
to generate mechanical power. Although the relation-
ship is not necessarily perfect, it is generally true that
the greater the muscle mass (greater cross-sectional
area), the greater the instantaneous force that can be
generated. Bigger muscles can generate more force be-
cause they can form more cross bridges within the
muscle myofibrils. However, while this sounds fairly
simple, the relationship between muscular strength

Peripheral adaptations: the skeletal muscles 37

and muscular power is complicated, as is the relation-
ship between muscular power and swim performance.

Strength is related, in part, to the ability of the CNS
to recruit muscle fibers and, in part, to muscle cross-
sectional area. However, the strongest athletes are not
necessarily the fastest swimmers. Recent research sug-
gests that while strength is related to muscular power
outputinswimmers, strength is nota good predictor of
swim performance. This is particularly true for women
swimmers. It may be that because women swimmers
have less inherent potential to develop muscle mass,
they tend to rely on stroke technique and stroke me-
chanics to generate swim velocity more so than men.
Research has shown that when normalized for muscle
cross-sectional area, the capacity of muscle to generate
force and power is similar for men and women. How-
ever, women in general simply have less muscle mass.

Hypertrophy

Organic muscular changes are gained largely through
cellular hypertrophy. These improvements occur
much more slowly, over many weeks and months.
Hypertrophy refers to increases in muscle fiber size
by increases in the volume of contractile proteins.
There is a suggestion that myogenic or “hypertrophic”
changes are more likely to occur in the specific muscle
fibers trained, even though increases in the cross-
sectional area of all muscle fiber types ultimately con-
tribute to maximal strength gains. There is not much
evidence in support of increases in fiber numbers in
response to training in humans. Nutrition has been
shown to influence the ability of an athlete to induce
hypertrophic changes. Limited protein intake (quan-
tity and quality) can limit the anabolic capacity in re-
sponse to a training program.

The central nervous system

The CNS is also known to play a role in muscular
force, muscular power, and muscular fatigue. Initia-
tion of a movement, coordination of the movement,
and the generation of the appropriate amount of force
required to complete a motor task clearly involves the
brain and the spinal cord. There is evidence to sug-
gest that with training, strength and power are, in

training bout. This requires changes within the CNS
and peripheral reflex pathways as it occurs too fast to
be organic in nature. It is not uncommon to observe
increases of 15-20% in power output following one or
two power-training sessions.

It has also been shown that the “excitability” of the
motor neuron pool within the spinal cord can be an
important variable in terms of the amount of force
an individual can generate. Research has shown that
recovery from extensive training results in an increase
in the excitability of the neuron in the spinal cord
that correlates to increased power and performance in
swimmers.

Fatigue

The cause of muscular fatigue is a very complicated
subject. Fatigue can be defined as a decline in the force
a muscle can generate. One theory of muscular fatigue
is that it is more a function of CNS transmitter deple-
tion than it is an inability of the metabolic pathways
to maintain energy supplies within the muscle. The
symptoms of Parkinson’s disease include a general feel-
ing of fatigue anda need for subjectively greater efforts
to complete even minimal muscular tasks. Parkinson's
disease is thought to be related to transmitter deple-
tion within specific areas in the brain responsible for
initiating movements. Pharmacologic therapies that
enhance transmitter production or biological activity
reduce the severity of the symptoms of Parkinson’s dis-
ease, at least in the short term. It is not impossible that
overtraining and excessive fatigue in swimmers may
be partially mediated by similar mechanisms.

We have seen previously that a cause of fatigue
may be metabolic, particularly in short sprint swims.
Fatigue can result from a depletion of available energy
because of an inhibition of the metabolic pathways.
This can be caused by the accumulation of metabolic
by-products such as hydrogen ions. This is suggested
as one cause of fatigue in very intensive sprint activi-
ties. In contrast, fatigue can occur as a result of insuf-
ficient substrate availability such as when prolonged
sustained activity depletes glycogen stores. It is doubt-
ful that this occurs in any of the common competi-
tive events but it is likely to be an issue during routine

intense training and during prolonged marathon
swimming.

The neuromuscular junction has also been impli-
cated as a potential source of fatigue. We have already
described how fatigue can be mediated by transmitter
depletion within theCNS. Other research has shown
that depletion of transmitters at the end of motor neu-
rons can also result in decreases in muscular force.
Clearly, the causes of fatigue are varied and are a func-
tion of the intensity of the exercise bout, its duration,
the physiological traits of the athlete, and the ath-
lete’s training state. Different athletes might fatigue
for different reasons even when participating in a sim-
ilar swim workout. The important point here is that
the CNS is likely an important contributor to strength
and power as well as fatigue. During the training plan,
careful consideration must be given to the specific ef-
fects training might have on CNS function.

Muscle fiber type

The specific traits of the muscle fibers are thought to
be, in part, dictated by the nerve fibers that inner-
vate them. They can be differentiated as well by the
characteristics of the proteins involved in the fiber’s
contractile apparatus (Fig. 3.3). Fibers that have high
myofibriller ATPase activity also have high maximum
velocities of shortening and are thus referred to as “fast
twitch.” Slow-twitch fibers have low ATPase activity
and take longer to reach peak tension. Muscles in the
body are generally composed of different percentages
of slow and fast-twitch fibers seemingly reflected by
how these muscles are used.

A motor unit, the motor neuron and all of the fibers
that are innervated by it, is the fundamental func-
tional unit of muscular activity. The metabolic char-
acteristics of the fibers within a given motor unit can
also be defined. Typically one of the mitochondrial
enzymes involved in oxidative metabolism is qualita-
tively assessed. This results in assigning either high or
low activity to oxidative characteristics of the fiber.
This has led to classification of muscle fibers as being
Type I or II, slow or fast. In addition, the oxidative
capacity of fast-twitch fibers can be classified as high
oxidative (Ila) or low oxidative (IIb). Several additional
fiber types have been described, with the most notable
of these being Type IIx. This latter fiber type has been
suggested to be somewhere between IIa and IIb as far

These specific traits act to influence the motor unit’s

nizing that the fast-twitch fibers contribute more force
at high limb speeds than do the slow-twitch fibers. Pos-
tural muscles, which are fatigue-resistant, are largely
slow twitch, while the prime movers have a greater
proportion of fast-twitch fibers.

Force-velocity relationship

Other factors specifically related to the architecture of
the muscle also affect muscular strength and power.
As noted earlier, the rate at which the muscle myofib-
rils shorten is a function of the inherent enzymatic
makeup of the fiber and is used as a means of differen-
tiating one fiber type from another. Fiber-shortening
velocity is an important factor in determining mus-
cle force output that makes the relationship between
strength and power even more complicated (Fig. 3.4).
When a muscle fiber is stimulated to contract, the rate
at which it does so is affected by the tension it is re-
quired to develop. The greater the tension or resis-
tance the muscle must overcome, the slower the veloc-
ity of shortening. When a fiber is required to shorten
with little or no resistance, the velocity of shorten-
ing is very high and power is high as well. At the
maximal force that a fiber can generate, there is no
shortening and thus the power falls to zero. The rela-
tionship between force and velocity dictates that the
maximal power a fiber can generate occurs when the
fiber exerts about one third of its maximal tension. It
has been suggested that changes in power following
a training program are most evident at the velocity at
which the muscle is trained. Training at a slow velocity

might improve strength without much effect at the
faster shortening velocities typically observed during
swimming.

Added to this relationship is the observation that
the rate at which a muscle shortens is related to
its length. Longer muscles shorten faster at a given
tension than short muscles because of the fact that
there are more muscle contractile “units” in series
in the longer fibers (Fig. 3.4). These characteristics may
prove to be important in terms of conferring success
in the various swim events.

Skeletal muscle mass

Athletes have little control over many of these factors
but because of the importance of power as a deter-
minant of maximum swim velocity, specific power
training is almost universally included as a critical
component of a swimmer’s training program. This
should be included if for no other reason than to in-
crease the muscle mass (and cross-sectional area) of
the prime movers. Invoking specific changes in muscle
mass through the swim season, however, has proven
difficult for the typical swim coach. As it turns out,

The difficulty for coaches who are training swim-
mers is that extensive, prolonged, exhaustive swim
practices tend to present cellular and central changes
consistent with improved muscular endurance rather
than improved muscular power. In other words, it has
been shown to be difficult to improve both the capac-
ity to generate high muscular power outputs and the
capacity to improve muscular endurance simultane-
ously. This is true even though the limiting factors for
the two traits are different. The type of training that in-
fluences one cellular trait in a positive manner seems
to compromise the other.

Arelevant question is: does a typical age group swim
training program favor sprinters or endurance ath-
letes? The answer to this question is dependent upon
the unique training plan of the swimmer’s coach. It
is tempting to hypothesize that individuals with a
mixed muscle fiber type might hold an advantage
at younger ages until the expression of other inher-
ent traits is fully realized. However, while muscular
endurance can be enhanced in young children, the
ability to increase aerobic capacity is limited until the
middle teens. Similarly, athletes can increase strength
and power through neurological means, but signifi-
cant gains due to hypertrophic muscular mechanisms
only occur postpuberty. The neuroendocrine axis is
not mature in young children to the point where phe-
notypic expression is significantly altered by training

until postadolescence. Thus, weight training and
power training should probably be postponed until
the athletes are physically mature. Or, it should be in-
cluded in the program at the point where significant
gains in muscular power are apparent. The research lit-
erature suggests that this might occur at or around the
age of 12 or 13 years in girls and 14 or 15 years in boys.
This is similar to what has been found to be true for
aerobic capacity. Large differences in Vozmax among
athletes become apparent only after puberty, which,
on the average, occurs during the early teenage years in
both girls and boys. There is not much literature avail-
able on the fiber type of young children. Fiber typing
is an invasive process that would be difficult to justify
for use in children for any purpose.

Sprint muscle

Now we address the prevailing thought on sprinting
and sprinters. The muscles involved in moving the
limbs of elite sprinters have been shown to contain a
high proportion of Type II fibers. In contrast, success-
ful distance athietes are known to have high percent-
ages of Type I fibers in their prime movers. Over the
last 25 years, many athletes have been “fiber-typed.”
The fiber type of the vastus lateralus, for example,

tions, cardiac and pulmonary responses, as compared
to the distance athlete. Distance athletes, in contrast,
are able to endure partially because of peripheral mus-

capacities (central endurance). The distance athlete
excels as a function of the adaptive structural and func-
tional responses of the heart, lung, and blood, periph-
eral vascular changes, as well as several very specific
peripheral skeletal muscle adaptations.

Because the skeletal muscles comprise nearly 50%
of body weight, they represent the major site of

select traits largely determine an individual’s capacity
to adapt to training and success in the various swim
events. While virtually any competitive swimmer can

complete the swim in 15 min or less. Similarly, many
swimmers can finish a 100-m swim in under a minute.

it has been many years since any swimmer, sprint or
otherwise, has been successful at the elite level with-
out an extensive training regimen.

Physical characteristics

Coaches often refer to certain individuals as “pure
sprinters” or “drop dead” sprinters. The pure sprinter is
an athlete that has difficulty performing ata high level
throughout a practice session, let alone throughout a
week of multiple practices per day. These individuals
appear to be able to sprint for 20-30 s (swim the 50
or 100 m) and fatigue at distances less than 100 m.
While this is an empirical observation from the
coach’s perspective, not much research has been fo-
cused specifically on “sprint-like” activity. The reason
for this is simple. Sprint activity cannot be sustained
beyond a fraction of a minute and thus careful analysis
of the physiologic and cellular determinants of sprint-
ing is nearly impossible. Time, or in this case the lack
of time, is the culprit.

Are there ways of assessing the “explosiveness” of a
swimmer without invasive muscle biopsy procedures?
Studies suggest that dryland measures that are some-
what useful include the standing vertical jump and
the two-hand chest pass. More sensitive measures are
those obtained in the water and include measuring
power via the use of a pulley-weight system such as the
commercially available Power Rack®. The procedure
involves having the athlete swim against progressively
increasing resistance while recording their time and
stroke count. Maximal power and power per stroke can
be measured in this manner and accounts for nearly
90% of the variance in maximal swim velocity.

Approaches available to describe other determi-
nants of sprint swimming include using a crass-
sectional sample of a diverse population of sprinters.
Another approach is to try to understand the underly-
ing fluid dynamic principles that contribute to max-
imal swim velocity. This will be the primary focus of
Chapters 4 and 5. Swimming fast is a balance between
propulsive forces and resistive forces. The relationship
between propulsive and resistive forces is such that re-
sistive forces are largely represented by the water and
increase with the square of the swimmer’s velocity.
Thus, as the velocity of the swimmer increases, the
muscular power required to swim just a bit faster in-
creases at an ever-greater rate, proportional to the in-
crease in resistance. Swimming fast, at velocities at or
above 2 m-s~!, requires a tremendous generation of
muscular force, an ability to generate it quickly, and
the ability to apply the force efficiently and effectively.
It would appear that the power output required to
achieve this velocity is such that metabolically it is
very difficult to sustain for much more than a minute.
Nevertheless, the sprinter’s skeletal muscles (and per-
haps the sprinter’s other specific anthropometric and
physiologic characteristics) play a large role in this re-
gard. Therefore, the two components of speed in swim-
ming are those inherent traits that convey muscular
and mechanical power and the neuromotor traits that
determine technique or skill.

Clearly the relationship between strength, power,
and swim velocity is complicated to a large extent
by those traits that dictate technique, or rather the
mechanical application of the strength and power
to the water, resulting in forward motion. The traits
that favor the generation of mechanical power include
height andarm length. Prominent sprinters tend to be
taller than average height. Arm span (from finger tip
to finger tip with the arms perpendicular to the body)
is generally equal to body height. In talented sprint-
ers, arm span tends to be 6-10% greater than height.
Hand size is important, as is foot size. Surprisingly,
the best sprinters are also shown to be the best kickers,
and maximal kick velocity correlates with sprint swim
time very highly.

While having a high Type IIb component is bene-
ficial, in terms of explosiveness and maximal power
output, the down side of this is that the traits that fa-

Training

One problem in terms of training the sprinter is that
the adaptability of the Type II fibers is low as far as
metabolic pathways are concerned. These fibers do
appear to be able to respond to simultaneous sprint
and endurance training. Hypertrophy does occur with
strength training, with an increase in myofibriller
content. Force production and power output increase
proportionately. Enzymes, mostly glycolyticenzymes,
responsible for generating energy from the available
substrates, however, are only likely to increase by
10-15% with sprint training. Immediate energy sup-
plies increase little or only proportional to the increase
in muscle mass. This contrasts to the 200-300% in-
crease in the aerobic enzyme concentrations in the
slow-twitch fiber with endurance training. What ap-
pears to occur then is when the fast-twitch fibers in-
crease their ability to generate force and power to a
significant degree with appropriate training, the abil-
ity to supply the energy required to sustain this power
is only marginally increased. The “holy grail” of sprint
coaching is referred to as “sprint-specific endurance.”
Coaches are looking for training tactics that will in-
crease maximal power output and help to sustain it
for as long as possible.

On the metabolic basis alone, the prediction might
be that improvements in short sprint performance
come from strength gains and sprint training, lead-
ing to greater instantaneous power output with little
or no increase (and maybe even a decrease) in the abil-
ity to resist fatigue. An example might be that over
100 m, the athlete with a preponderance of Type II
fibers can be trained to take it out faster but the drop-
off between the first and second halves might remain
approximately the same. The improvements in short

of the race, rather than relative improvements in the
second half. For the “pure sprinter,” the only tactic
available might be to train the front end of the race
and “get out fast,” as the ability to bring it back might
be inherent and of limited trainability.

Asacoach, itis tempting to attempt to establish a sig-
nificant aerobic base by interval or over-distance train-
ing with short rest. The problem lies in the fact that if
you overtrain a sprinter using programs that enhance
fatigue resistance and stimulate aerobic metabolism,
more likely than not, the sprinter’s ability to sprint
will not be enhanced, rather only compromised. The
specificity of training applies at the cellular level as
well as to the whole body. Sprinters who undergo
extensive over-distance training and training to im-
prove aerobic capacity generally express a decrease in
their explosive power output. It is nearly impossible
to train for explosiveness and endurance at the same
time without compromising the traits that lead to
explosiveness.

It is important to remember that much of the im-
proved power output gained by sprint swimmers is
neurological rather than biochemical. There is scien-
tific evidence that shows endurance training might
reduce the excitability of the motor neurons. This can
be interpreted as reducing the recruitment of muscle
fibers given the same central motor stimulus. Mid-
season declines in explosiveness might be of CNS ori-
gin rather than peripheral or muscular as is generally
assumed.

When a sprinter is trained using a program designed
to increase endurance, many changes are evident. As
might be expected, mitochondrial volume is increased
and subsequently there is an improvement in aero-
bic enzyme concentration. While this improves the
swimmers’ ability to sustain submaximal swim veloc-
ities and their ability to recover from intensive bouts
of exercise, their ability to sprint is significantly dete-
riorated. The Type IIb fibers lose cross-sectional area
and the ability to produce power through non-robic
means is also reduced. With an increased mitochon-
drial volume comes the increased ability to “clear” lac-
tate evidenced by lower blood lactate values anda shift
in OBLA. This would act to favor a quicker recovery but
not necessarily improve performance per se.

Consistent with Noakes’ revised model of fatigue,

line with the observation that swim times only im-
prove after the sprint athlete is fully recovered and
tapered. The distance swimmer might show contin-
ued improvement as systemic and enzymatic adapta-
tions continue to occur. The question therefore be-
comes: is continued aerobic training optimal or even
necessary for the sprinter? Some coaches today believe
that sprinters can train hard and swim well year-round
without approaching the point of general exhaustion
or becoming overtrained.

An interesting observation that might be of rel-
evance here is the possibility that muscle fibers
might also self-regulate specific traits as a function
of their metabolic needs. When high rates of aero-
bic metabolism are required, the muscle fiber may
limit hypertrophy specifically as a means to achieve
optimal diffusion of respiratory gases into and out
of the cell. Diffusion is, in part, related to the dis-
tance or tissue thickness across which the gases dif-
fuse. Thus, the maximal diffusion rates within mus-
cle tissues are a function of the distances between the
capillary and the intracellular mitochondria] matrix.
Increases in the aerobic capacity of the muscle at some
point will require increased capillary density and in-
creased mitochondrial mass per volume of muscle tis-
sue. These increases must be proportional to any gains
in muscle mass, and may be greater. This assumes, of
course, that the various components of the system
are roughly matched and that symmorphosis drives
function.

What this says in simple terms is that distance swim-
mers and ultra-marathoners cannot afford the relative
muscularity of the sprint swimmer when viewed from
acellular metabolic basis alone. It may be that the need
for high diffusion rates acts to limit the amount of mus-
cle hypertrophy that can be sustained maximally. On
the other hand, sprinters who are limited in their per-
formances by the ability to generate muscular power
may not necessarily be helped in these short events by
improving their aerobic potential. In the world of the
sprinter, the goal is strictly to increase instantaneous
power output while minimizing the various elements
of resistance.

Sprint talent identification

Is it possible that competitive swim programs “weed
out” pure sprinters by the time they reach high school?

This seems to be a distinct possibility even though,
in the United States at least, much of the competi-
tion for the younger age groups tends to be short
sprint-type events. Despite this, many coaches seem
to be training their young athletes to endure the
practice sessions rather than to be able to swim spe-
cific competitive events. The pure sprinter may be
successful in meets when adequately rested but may
have difficulty practicing with any sustained qual-
ity. Alternatively, once swimmers reach their mid-
dle teens, many of the purely sprint events are elimi-
nated from age group competitions and emphasis is
placed more upon middle distance events. Practice
distances and practice expectations rise such that the
sprinter can easily become discouraged and eventu-
ally quit. While it is common practice at the colle-
giate level to identify a sprint group and train them
accordingly, few age group coaches have the time or
personnel to be able to do so. Furthermore, the ex-
pression of the underlying inherited traits, the phe-
notype of an individual, becomes more apparent
postpuberty.

General conclusions on sprinters

With this information in mind, if a perfect sprinter
could be designed, what would one look like? Mus-
cularity would be a great trait to start with though
not all sprinters exactly fit the stereotype. Tall, large
hands, broad shoulders, long arms and legs, lean,
muscular with big feet would be included in a set of
traits that might define our perfect sprinter. Interest-
ingly, these are virtually the same traits that Johnny
Weissmuller (who in the 1920s once held every sprint
freestyle world record) listed nearly 70 years ago when
asked to describe what made him a great sprinter.
One need only look toward Gary Hall Jr., Alexander
Popov, Matt Biondi, Pieter van den Hoogenband, Jim
Montgomery, and others to see that similar traits re-
main appropriate today. However, this does not mean
that these specific traits are absolute requirements for
outstanding sprint performance, as there are always
successful individuals who might be seen as excep-
tions to these generalities. In these cases, it may be
the intangible factors that contribute the most to out-
standing performance. The sport psychologist might
be right in stating that winning is 90% mental and
10% physical.

Distance swimmers

The elite distance athlete is much tougher to describe.
To a greater extent the ability to excel at the longer
competitive events is much less dictated by anthro-
pometric traits (height, arm span, etc.) than are the
sprint events. This may be due to the importance of
the “distance swimmer’s mentality,” or to less appar-
ent physiological characteristics.

As the event distance increases, the contribution
of the aerobic pathway to performance increases. As
such, the importance of the match between mito-
chondrial respiration and the ability to supply the
tissues with necessary metabolic substrates become
paramount. Unfortunately, there are few external
clues to an individual’s mitochondrial mass. Cardiac
volumes are also impossible to casually assess.
Performance-related variables must therefore be used
by coaches to predict endurance talent.

Physiologists are confident that the rate at which
food energy can be converted to physiologically avail-
able energy largely determines swim performance. In
distance events, this conversion rate is primarily a
function of mitochondrial respiration and the ability
of the cardiorespiratory system to supply the periph-
eral tissues with substrates. These are reflected in the
assessment of aerobic capacity ( Voomax) and the anaer-
obic threshold.

The difficulty in assessing these values in swimmers
is that the most accurate means of doing so requires
that it be done while swimming. Because of the need
for ventilatory volumes and expired gas analysis, mea-
suring the Voomax in swimmers is far from routine. The
development of swim flumes has eased the problems
and yet the accessibility to the few flumes in existence
has limited the value to coaches. It should also be rec-
ognized that the ability to significantly alter Voomax
through training is only apparent after puberty. Re-
search has shown that children express a surprisingly
similar aerobic capacity up to the early teenage years
irrespective of their sex. This may be one explanation
for why girls can compete with boys on an even basis
until this age.

In contrast to the very high values obtained
from elite cross-country skiers (in excess of 80 ml
O2-kg-!-min=!), Voamax values for swimmers are
much lower (on the order of 55-65 ml. kg-! . min-?).

Peripheral adaptations: the skeletal muscles 47

There are potentially two reasons for these findings.
First, itis known that Vozmax isafunction of the muscle
mass being employed during the exercise. Swimming
uses the muscles of the chest, arms, and back, and sec-
ondarily the trunk, and leg muscles. It is suggested
that the muscle mass employed during swimming is
thus less than perhaps cycling or running. Secondly,
when the values for swimmers are reported, they are
not commonly separated by event. Thus, the values
forsprinters, mid-distance, and distance swimmers are
pooled, oraveraged, and only a single value is reported.
It is likely that the distance athletes have significantly
higher values for VOzmax When compared to the sprint-
ers, similar to what is reported for athletes in other
sports.

The anaerobic threshold was originally proposed
as the point whereby oxygen became limited during
a progressive test. We now know that except during
near-maximal or maximal exercise, oxygen consump-
tion does not appear limited by oxygen availability.
The threshold, as indexed by the appearance of lac-
tic acid levels in the blood and nonlinear increases in
ventilation, isnow seen as a marker of balance between
aerobic and non-oxygen-consuming metabolic path-
ways. As such, it is a better predictor of success in en-
durance events than is VoOomax. The optimal combina-
tion for outstanding performance isa high Vozmax and
a high anaerobic threshold. The high Vozmax Comes as

and the cardiovascular capacity to deliver oxygen and
other necessary substrates ata rapid rate. Peripheral tis-
sue adaptations include high tissue vascularity, high
mitochondrial volumes, high myoglobin concentra-
tions, and enzymatic adaptations allowing high rates
of fat metabolism.

Itis possible to train an athlete who might bea geno-
typic sprinter to express a distance athlete’s pheno-
type. Aerobic training tends to “push” the inherent
fiber type toward the metabolic traits of the Type I

swimming.

Distance events

The pure distance events are the 800- and 1500-m
freestyles. Although the 400 freestyle and 400 individ-
ual medley may be considered by some to be distance
events, they are more properly classified as middle-
distance, but usually serveas companions to thelonger

no true distance event comparable to the marathon.
The energy systems used during 400-, 800-, 1500-m
races lasting approximately 4, 8, and 16 min, respec-
tively, compare more favorably to running distances
between 1500 m and 5 km than the energy systems
used during the marathon. Unlike running, it iscom-
mon to see distance swimmers compete in all the
events, from 50 to 1500 m, at some point in a season.
For example, a distance swimmer may be required to
swim a fast 200 on a relay. Hence, the distance swim-
mer uses all the energy systems and types of training
discussed in this book, but in different proportions
than the sprint swimmer.

Physical characteristics

A picture of the typical distance swimmer and dis-
tance training over the past 30 years can be con-
structed from opinions expressed by successful dis-
tance coaches at the American Swimming Coaches
Association World Clinics (Distance Training School,
1997).

Distance swimmers come in all shapes and sizes, but
just as the distance runner must have a high strength-
to-weight ratio, so must the distance swimmer. The
characteristics discussed previously that infer high aer-
obic capacity are essential—high mitochondrial den-
sity, high percent of slow-twitch fibers, large cardiac
output, etc. Some of the best distance swimmers have
been tail, slender, buoyant, flexible, light-framed, and
lightly muscled, i.e., they look like distance runners.
Because of their fiber type, they usually are not good
jumpers.

Endurance ability is evident at an early age. The bud-
ding distance swimmer may not be the fastest member
of the team, but can sustain a high energy output for

a long time and can withstand more training volume
than the rest of the team. At the elite level, the most
successful distance swimmers tend to be younger than
the most successful sprinters. For example, over the
past decade at the US Long Course Nationals, the av-
erage age of the women finalists in the 1500 m was
16.8 years, compared to 21.3 years for the finalists in
the 50-m freestyle. The men show a similar pattern.
The average age of the finalists in the men’s 1500 m
was 19.8 years compared to 23.4 years for the finalists
in the 50-m freestyle.

Mental characteristics

It takes a certain type of person to be a distance swim-
mer, one with the attitude and work ethic necessary
to enjoy performing difficult workouts day in and day
out, even doing more than is required. Distance swim-
mers enjoy hard work and competition, both in prac-
tice and at meets. They enjoy competing against the
clock and have a keen sense of pace. Distance swim-
ming requires concentration, and it has been said that
smart people win the distance events, especially long
course meters. Distance swimmers have an awareness
of what they are doing in practice and want to know
why they are doing it. Other common descriptors for
the personality of the distance swimmer include easy-
going, low key, well organized, independent, doers,
and well adapted.

Training

It takes careful preparation to succeed as a distance
swimmer. As Bill Sweetenham says, “The best prepared
swimmers win the 1500.” Although the volume of
training performed by distance swimmers has fluc-
tuated over the past several decades, it is universally
accepted that in order to be successful, one must work
very hard, not only in terms of volume of work, but
quality as well. The typical volume seems to be about
80 000 m per weekin 10-11 workouts, with some anaer-
obic work for speed. There is no secret, just lots of
hard work. Dick Jochums summarizes distance train-
ing as follows: “The key for the distance swimmer is to

Taper

Because distance events are physically and emotion-

too often. The length of the taper depends on age,
muscle mass, length of the race, and the mental char-
acteristics of the athlete. Older and more heavily mus-

races usually require less taper. Some distance swim-
mers do not respond well toa taper, mentally or phys-

one sentence: “The taper, for the distance freestyler,
is basically a two-week period of race rehearsal and
rest.”

Motivation

The key to a successful distance program is a close rela-
tionship between the swimmer and the coach, because
it is the coach who creates an attitude and an environ-
ment that promotes hard work. “The way to make it
fun is to create enthusiasm for the event, highlight
the event, prioritize the event and put distance swim-
mers together as frequently as possible to train, not
to compete. They will compete by simple training to-
gether” (Bill Sweetenham). “In my mind, there is no
secret when it comes to endurance training. The key is
that the coach must motivate the athlete to train hard
on a consistent basis” (Mark Schubert).

Conclusions

The proteins within the skeletal muscles comprise the
microfilaments that generate force. To generate force,
however, requires metabolic support via energy pro-
duction within the cells, This must be accompanied
by cardiovascular changes and the ability to supply
the muscles with needed substrates. Skeletal muscle

support the specific muscular adaptations must be a

swer is: Yes! Elite sprinters are different from elite dis-
tance swimmers. In addition, they train differently to
enhance those traits necessary for success in their re-
spective events, Central factors as well as important
metabolic and inherent peripheral traits character-
ize individuals and tend to favor success in specific
events. Because of the unique combination of require-
ments necessary for success, training must be specific
and strategies for training swimmers must be founded
upon each individual’s inherent traits.

The mechanics of swimming.

Introduction

Mechanics is the field of physics that deals with the
laws of motion, and the effects of forces upon objects
or the behavior of those objects. Therefore, the me-
chanics of swimming is the study of how swimmers
interact with the water to accomplish motion. The
forces behind this motion are highly complex, and
an understanding of them requires knowledge of not
only the swimmer’s motion, but also the motion of
the water, and the interaction between the two. That
may seem obvious, but in the twentieth century, most
swimming scientists, trained in biomechanics but not
fluid mechanics, focused mainly on the motion of
the swimmer. The motion of the water was usually
ignored. However, just as a set of footprints can tell
an accomplished tracker many things about a person
being tracked (direction, speed, weight, height, etc.),
the water motion around and behind a swimmer can
reveal many things about the swimmer.

There are sophisticated tools and techniques in use
today by engineers and scientists in mainstream engi-
neering fields that can significantly advance the state-
of-the-art in swimming mechanics. Most of them
remain untapped, however, simply because the swim-
ming community is unaware of them or deems them
too complicated. A successful migration of these tools
into the field of swimming mechanics would greatly
advance the state-of-the-art in swimming. This will,
however, require a better understanding of fluid me-
chanics by the swimming community. The next two
chapters contain information designed to assist the

reader in acquiring such understanding. Some of the
information is standard fare for swimming books, but
much of it, derived from the field of fluid mechan-
ics, will be new to the swimming community. With
this additional knowledge, it is hoped that swimming
scientists will be encouraged to use the more sophisti-
cated tools available to them, and that swim coaches
will be provided with useful background information
to help them properly interpret and apply the results
of such research.

Chapter 4 presents some basic principles of fluid
mechanics as they apply to swimming, and by neces-
sity, also contains a number of definitions. Chapter 5
applies the principles presented in Chapter 4 to the
two interrelated topics of resistance and propulsion.
Although some mathematical equations are shown,
the derivations of those equations are not presented,
nor do we discuss “how” to perform the four swim-
ming strokes. There are many other books that suc-
cessfully accomplish those tasks. The goal herein is
simple: Show how the principles and concepts of
biomechanics and fluid mechanics can be applied to
swimming. Many of the examples employed herein
to explain these principles involve shapes such as
spheres, cylinders, airfoils, etc. These were used be-
cause their simple shapes often better demonstrate
the principles. More importantly, the research ap-
plying these principles to swimmers has not been
done.

Some readers may find this material to be too com-
plicated and beyond the requirements of the average

Fluid mechanics for swimmers

By necessity, this chapter must include many defini-
tions. Although such lists are as unsavory to the author
as they probably are to the readers, they are, unfortu-
nately, a necessary evil. You must first be familiar with
the language of fluid mechanics in order to apply it to
swimming.

General mechanics definitions

¢ Motion is the process of changing position. Motion
may be broken down into two categories: translation
and rotation. Translation occurs when all parts of
an object travel the same distance in the same direc-
tion in the same time. Rotation occurs when all parts
of the body rotate about an axis either inside or out-
side the body, and travel through the same angle and
in the same direction in the same time.

* Speed is the rate at which an object travels.

* Velocity (v) is a speed in a specified direction.

*¢ Acceleration (a) is the rate at which velocity changes
with time. It may be positive, indicating an increase in
velocity with time, or negative, indicating a decrease
in velocity with time

* Acceleration due to gravity (g) may be taken as a con-
stant 9.8146 m-s~?.

* Force (F)is that which produces or tends to produce
motion ora change in the motion of bodies. A propul-
sive force causes motion and a resistive force hinders
motion. A force divided by an area equals a pressure.
* Mass (m) is the amount of material that an object
has, as reflected in its inertia.

° Weight (W) is the magnitude of the force of grav-
ity pulling on an object. Mass will always be con-
stant under varying gravitational forces, but weight
will change. For example, an astronaut will weigh less
onthe moon than on the earth, but will have the same
mass.

* Center of gravity (c.g.) is the point through which the
weight of an object appears to act. This is a very im-
portant point because it affects a person’s balance and
stability. For sports applications, the center of gravity

of a body.

* Angular velocity (w) is the time rate of change of an-
gular rotation about a specified axis.

¢ Angular momentum (L) is a quantity of angular (rota-

¢ Fluid—Most common fluids we encounter (such as
air and water) may be classified as simple fluids, i.e.,
they deform continuously when a shear load is applied
to them.

* Density (o)is the mass per unit volume ofa substance.
The undisturbed mass density of water over the range
of environmental conditions encountered by swim-
mers is essentially a constant (see Table 4.1). However,
the swimmer, through stroking and kicking motions,
can temporarily modify the water density through the
entrainment of air in local areas near the body.

* Absolute viscosity (u) is a property that reveals how
much a fluid can resist shearing deformation. It is
defined as the shear stress applied to a laminar fluid

element divided by the rate of shear strain produced.
For example, molasses has a higher viscosity than
water.

* Kinematic viscosity (v) is the absolute viscosity di-
vided by the density. It often arises in mathematical
treatments of fluid motion. Both the kinematic and
absolute viscosity of water change with temperature,
another property of water.

* Compressibility is a measure of how much a fluid can
be compressed. Unless air is entrained in the water, wa-
ter is essentially incompressible, and as such, is easier
to deal with than are compressible fluids such as air.

¢ Temperature (T) is important for swimming fluid me-
chanics because the viscosity of the water varies with
temperature, see Table 4.1.

¢ Pressure (p) is a force per unit area. There exists a
pressure at every point within a fluid. When a fluid
is flowing around an object, the direction of pressure
upon that object is by definition perpendicular to the
object’s surface. That pressure may be either positive
or negative (suction).

¢ Hydrostatic pressure is a pressure that arises in static
fluids because any point beneath the surface of a fluid
has to support the weight of the fluid above it. The hy-
drostatic pressure at any pointina fluid is proportional
to the depth of that point beneath the free surface.

¢ Buoyant force is a force that is a beneficial conse-
quence of hydrostatic pressure. The upward buoyant
force on a body in a fluid is equal to the weight of
the fluid displaced by the body. The bottom surface
of an object submerged or partially submerged in a
fluid has pressure acting on it that is larger than the
pressure acting on the top surface of the body. This is
because hydrostatic pressure increases with depth of
submergence. Thus, the net water force on the body is
upward, acting against the force of gravity.

* Center of buoyancy is the center of gravity of the water
displaced by a body submerged or partially submerged
ina fluid.

* Streamline is a continuous line drawn through a fluid
so that it has the direction of the flow velocity at every
point.

* A fluid particle is simply a “particle” of fluid that can
be envisioned as moving in the fluid flow. It will always
move tangent to the streamline when the flowis steady
(does not change with time).

* Turbulence in a flowing fluid means that there
are velocity fluctuations where the fluid changes its

magnitude and/or direction. Although turbulence
involves random fluctuations, it has been found by
experiment that certain average properties of the fluc-
tuations are adequate to describe turbulent flow. These
two standard properties arecalled turbulenceintensity
and turbulence length or scale.

* Turbulence intensity may be viewed as a measure of
the fluid velocity fluctuation over time relative to the
steady state velocity. Mathematically it is defined as
the ratio of the root-mean-square of the velocity fluc-
tuations to the mean flow velocity. In a swimming
pool during a race, swimmers will encounter turbu-
lent water that has been churned up by themselves or
other swimmers, as well as still water with little or zero
turbulence.

¢ Turbulence length or scale may be viewed as the size of
pockets or balls of turbulence in the water. It is likely
that turbulence scale will be comparable in size to pres-
sure wakes and vortices shed from other swimmers.

¢ Angle of attack (a) is the angle at which an ob-
ject is inclined from the direction of flow. Figure 4.1
shows a body moving at an angle of attack of approx-
imately 20°.

Dimensionless parameters
of fluid mechanics

There are several dimensionless parameters that play
very important roles in fluid mechanics. Four of these
parameters can be applied to swimming, and they
are defined next. Each parameter contains something
called a characteristic length (L). This is a dimension
that best describes the size of an object involved in
the fluid flow of interest. Examples of a characteris-
tic length for an airplane wing, sphere, and a swim-
mer’s hand would be, respectively, the wing chord
length, the sphere diameter, and the width of the hand
(thumb to little finger).

* Reynolds number (Re) was developed in 1863 by
Osborn Reynolds. It provides a criterion to determine
the state of flow for problems where the relationship
between inertia and viscous forces is important—a
common occurrence in swimming. Reynolds number
is defined as

Re =" = — (4.1)

where p is the fluid density, v is the velocity of the
fluid relative to an object in the flow field, L is the
characteristic length, y is the fluid absolute viscosity,
and v is the fluid kinematic viscosity. Two examples of
Reynolds number calculations are shown below:
1 Example: Calculate the Reynolds number for the
downbeat kick of a butterfly swimmer’s foot moving at
5.5 m-s~!, when the foot is 0.12-m wide and the water
temperature is 25°C.
Solution: Re = vL/v = $.5 m-s~!(0.12 m)/0.891
x 10-6 m?.s~! = 7.407 x 105
2 Example: Calculate the Reynolds number for a
swimmer’s hand moving at 2.4 m - s~!. The hand
width is 0.1 m and the water temperature is 25°C.
Solution: Re = vL/v = 2.4m-s~! (0.1 m)/0.891 x
10-6 m?-s~? = 2.694 x 105
¢ Froude number (Fr) isa dimensionless parameter that
is significant for fluid flow around objects that are in
proximity of, or penetrating through, a free surface.
For swimming applications, the free surface is the air-
water interface. The Froude number is important for
wave drag, and is defined as

Fr= — 4.2

where v is the velocity of the fluid relative an object
in the flow field, g is the acceleration due to gravity
(9.8146 m-s~2), and L isacharacteristic length descrip-
tive of an object in a flow field, just as for Reynolds
number.

1 Example: Calculate the Froude number for a swim-
mer in the streamlined position, moving at 1 m.s“!
with a length L, fingertips to toes, of 2.1m.

Solution: v = 1 m-s~!, L = 2.1m, g = 9.8146 m-s-?

General categories of fluid motion

It is useful to classify fluid flow into categories based
upon its physical characteristics. The characteristics
are numerous, and they can be combined together in
a variety of ways to form many categories of flow. Each
unique category of flow is governed by mathemati-
cal equations that can differ greatly from one another
based upon the characteristics of the flows involved.
For instance, the flow of a fluid that is steady, incom-
pressible, and inviscid (also called an ideal fluid) is rep-
resented by mathematically simple equations in com-
parison to those for unsteady compressible viscous
flow. The mathematics will not be presented here, but
the reader should conceptually understand the differ-
ences between the various types of fluid flow that are
discussed next. Why is this important? This informa-
tion willbe helpful in understanding Chapter 5, where
the drag and propulsive forces discussed depend upon
the type of flow being evaluated.

¢ Internal vs. external vs. open channel flow—Internal
flow is flow completely bounded by solid boundaries.

The mechanics of swimming 55

Examples are water flowing through pipes or air flow-
ing through ducts. External flow is the unbounded
flow around solids totally immersed in a fluid, such as
airflow around an airplane. Open channel flow occurs
when there is a so-called free surface (air—water inter-
face) present. An example of this would be the flow of
a river. The flow of water around a swimmer has char-
acteristics from both external flow and open channel
flow. While many of the fluid mechanics phenomena
we will apply to swimmers come from external flow
assumptions, some of them, such as wave drag, result
from the presence of a free surface.

* Steady vs. unsteady flow—When the time-averaged
properties at each point in a flow field do not change
with time, the flow is called steady. For a body mov-
ing through water, this requires that a body’s size,
shape, orientation, and velocity relative to the water
remain constant. The flow around a swimmer is al-
most always unsteady. The changes in speed and/or
the direction of motion of the arms and legs are obvi-
ous, and these changes significantly affect how much
propulsive force swimmers can develop. Also obvious
is the change in body velocity during the breaststroke
(+45% from the mean body velocity), But even the
body velocity of an elite freestyle swimmer can vary
as much as +15% from the mean velocity. The un-
steady flow about swimmers hands and arms will be
discussed at length in Chapter S. Itisimportant to note
that a fluid can be both steady and turbulent. It is the
average flow properties remaining constant with time
that make the flow steady, and it is the microfluctu-
ations about these average values that make the flow
turbulent.

© Compressible vs, incompressible flow—When the den-
sity of a fluid changes, the flow is compressible. Flow
is incompressible when variations in density are neg-
ligible, as is true for most flows irivolving swimming.
One exception occurs when air bubbles are injected
into the water by a swimmer’s arms and legs, This phe-
nomenon is called entrainment, and the addition of
the bubbles changes the average density of the water
in the entrainment area. Once the arms or legs have
moved far enough to leave the bubbles behind, the
flow becomes incompressible again.

The movement of the liquid-bubble mixture caused
by entrainment is called two-phase flow. Two-phase
flow is a very complicated subject, but one simple
way to model such a mixture is to consider it a

homogeneous fluid with a mass density approxi-
mately equal to that of water with a compressibility
arising from the air bubble content. There have been
more accurate studies that show how density varies
with bubble size, air-water mass ratios, and pressure,
but their application to swimming is not yet practical,
mainly because we do not have quantifiable dataabout
bubble entrainment. Also, the effective “shape” of the
hand (that the water “sees”) may be totally changed
by bubbles temporarily adhering to the hand surface,
thus changing the propulsive ability of the hand.

8 Viscous vs. inviscid flow—Inviscid fluid flow has no
viscosity. Put a swimmer in such a fluid, and there is
no drag! Actually such a fluid does not really exist, but
the concept can be very useful for some flow situa-
tions. For example, for fluids, such as water, that have
a relatively small viscosity, the effects of internal fric-
tion in the fluid are significant only in a thin region
along any boundary. For swimmers, this means that
viscosity is only important for the fluid flowing very
near the swimmer’s skin. This area of flow is called the
boundary layer. Although small in size, the bound-
ary layer plays a large role in drag calculations (this
is discussed in more detail later in this chapter). Out-
side the boundary layer, the flow may be considered as
inviscid.

* Uniform vs. nonuniform flow—Uniform flow occurs
when the velocity is equal at every point in the flow
(equal in both magnitude and direction) at any given
instant in time. The velocity can, however, change
with time. Flow where the velocity varies from place
to place for any given instant of time is called nonuni-
form. The flow of water moving around a swimmer is
nonuniform.

* Rotational (vortex) flow vs. irrotational flow—When
fluid particles in a fluid rotate about any axis the
flow is called rotational or vortex flow. Otherwise, the
flow is called irrotational. Flow around swimmers is,
at many places, rotational. The most obvious exam-
ples are the vortices created by a swimmer’s hands and
feet.

* Ideal flow—Fluid flow that is both incompressible
and inviscid is called an ideal fluid. Ideal fluids can
be represented by mathematically simple equations.
¢ Laminar vs. turbulent flow—Viscous flow may be split
into two subcategories: laminar flow and turbulent
flow. In laminar flow, the motion is smooth and can
best be understood by envisioning water flowing

along in layers or laminae that are moving at different
velocities. There is no mixing between adjacent layers;
dye injected into a laminar flow would follow a single
line. Turbulent flow is characterized by a mixing up of
all the layers of the fluid, and dye injected into a tur-
bulent flow would quickly break up and be dispersed
among the various layers of the fluid. A comparison
of the two flows is shown in Fig. 4.2. Swimmers en-
counter both types of flow, and whether the flow is
laminar or turbulent greatly affects a swimmer’s drag.
* Boundary layer flow vs. free stream flow—When fluid
flows around an object, the object has a localized effect
on the flow velocity. The fluid velocity is zero at the
solid~fluid interface, and increases to what is called
the free stream velocity within a thin layer of fluid
immediately adjacent to the interface. This thin layer
is called the boundary layer, and the flow inside it is
viscous. The depth of the boundary layer varies with
the pressure, velocity, and viscosity of the fluid and
the shape and roughness of the object. Flow inside
a boundary layer can be either laminar or turbulent.
Laminar flow is generally characterized by smaller
Reynolds numbers than is turbulent flow. A laminar
boundary layer will get thicker as the fluid moves along
the surface, and may eventually become turbulent or
separated (see later). Laminar and turbulent bound-
ary layers have different flow profiles (Fig. 4.3) that
account for significant differences in drag.

Outside the boundary layer, the free stream flow
may be considered to be inviscid and can be split into
two categories: undisturbed free stream flow, which is

For submerged objects, there is a critical Reynolds

transition from laminar flow to turbulent flow. The
value of this number depends on the object’s surface
roughness, the amount of initial turbulence in the st-
ream, and how quickly pressure and velocity change
along the length of the boundary layer. At swimming
race velocities, the Reynolds numbers for various mov-
ing body parts are of the orders 10° and 10°.

¢ Separated vs. attached flow—Attached flow occurs
when the boundary layer follows the contours of the
submerged object. If the boundary layer stops follow-
ing these contours, the flow is said to be separated. The
total drag on a swimmer or any object moving through
water is greatly increased when boundary layer sep-
aration takes place. Engineers go to great lengths to
design objects so that flow passing by them remains
attached to the surface. They try to avoid separation by
not making any “sudden” changes to the surface shape
of the object in the flow. It is analogous to driving your
car around a curve in the road. If the road curves too
sharply for the speed you are traveling, your car will
slide off the road. The same idea applies to water as it
moves around a body. If the body curves too sharply for
the velocity of the water, the water just cannot “make
the curve,” and will separate from the surface, creating
a low-pressure area behind the object. An example of

this may be seen in Fig. 4.4. Because of the shape and
velocity ofaswimmer moving through water, there are
areas where the boundary layer separates from a swim-
met’s body. How this separation increases a swimmer’s
drag will be discussed in Chapter S.

Categories of flow that apply
to swimming

The motion ofa swimmer is far more complicated than
even that of a fighter aircraft undergoing the most
extreme maneuver possible. Indeed, in a single-stroke
cycle swimmers encounter all the categories of flow
listed earlier, except internal flow. This wide range
of flow categories and the complex variation of flow
with time and location prohibit exact closed-form
analyses of the fluid flow field around a swimmer.
However, in some cases, simplifying assumptions
may be made to reduce the complexity of the flow
problem, and allow the application of simplified
fluid mechanics equations to be applied to specific
parts of a stroke. When this is done, it is important
to remember the assumptions (and associated limi-
tations) that were made to allow the development of
the simplified equations. These assumptions should
properly be viewed as information as significant as
the principles or equations themselves. Why is this
obvious fact even mentioned? All too often in the
published literature, theories or results valid for a
specific type of flow have been broadly misapplied to
all flow types. One example, discussed in Chapter 5,
is the persistent misuse of Bernoulli’s equation to
explain the lift generated by a swimmer’s hands.

Principle of relative motion
for steady flow

On December 17, 1903, Wilbur and Orville Wright
made history as they flew mankind’s first sustained
powered flight in a heavier-than-air machine. The
Wright brothers were much more than a couple of
bicycle mechanics—as they have occasionally been
described. Their correspondence with knowledgeable
engineers throughout the world and their lectures

to engineering societies about aerodynamics showed
them to be well ahead of other aviation enthusiasts of
their time. Although they used data obtained from
various gliding experiments by Otto Lilienthal and
Octave Chanute, it was their own research in their own
wind tunnel that contributed most to their success.
They had reasoned that the aerodynamic forces on
an airplane are the same whether the airplane moves
through still air or the airplane is fixed and air is
moved past it. In other words, it is only the relative
motion of the air and the airplane that is important.

This principle is very convenient because it allows
us to change our frame of reference, one moment dis-
cussing water flowing past a swimmer and the next
moment discussing a swimmer moving through the
water, knowing that the forces generated between the
water and swimmer are the same in both circum-
stances. There is, however, one very important restric-
tion to this principle: It only applies to steady flow, and
not to unsteady flow.

For unsteady flow, the force on a stationary body
in an accelerating fluid is greater than the force ona
body accelerating through a fluid by a factor called
the horizontal buoyancy force. The horizontal buoy-
ancy force, so named because it is brought about by a
horizontal pressure gradient, is equal to pVa, where
p is the fluid density, V is a characteristic volume
of the body (similar to a characteristic length), and
a is the acceleration of the body. As was noted previ-
ously, the velocities ofa swimmer’s handsand center of
mass during the four strokes show various degrees of
unsteadiness. So while the application of the princi-
ple of relative motion to a freestyler’s center of gravity
would result in only a small error, a similar applica-
tion to the body motion of a breaststroker or the hand
and arm motions for any of the four strokes would re-
sult in more significant errors. A method to account
for unsteady flow in drag calculations is presented in
Chapter 5.

Resistance and propulsion

Barry S. Bixler

Have you ever dreamed of flying through the sky like
a bird? As children, most of us had that dream at some
point in our life. And even once in a while as adults,
in those rare moments of uninterrupted quiet, some
of us still wonder what it would be like to soar ef-
fortlessly above the earthbound masses. Astronauts
achieve weightlessness of course, but they can only
propel themselves by pushing off from their spacecraft
wall, and then they cannot change direction or speed.
The fact is—we humans do fly—not in air, but in wa-
ter. We call it swimming. We propel ourselves through
water without aid of machines, changing speed and di-
rection at will, or even just “hovering” like humming-
birds at the water’s surface. Swimming is the closest
thing to flying (without other apparatus) that we hu-
mans will ever do, and in this chapter, we will discuss
how we accomplish it.

Newton's laws of motion

The starting points for almost any subject in mechan-
ics are Isaac Newton’s laws of motion. They were for-
mulated by Newton after carrying out a large number
of experiments, and were published in the Principia
(1686):

¢ First Law: A body of constant mass remains at rest, or
moves with constant velocity in a straight line, unless
acted upon by a force.

* Second Law: A particle acted upon by a force (F)
moves (velocity v) so that the time rate of change of its
linear momentum equals the force. Mathematically,

for a mass (m), which can change with time, this may
be written as three equations:

F, = =m; (S.1)

where i represents the three principle coordinate axes.
* Third Law: To every action there is an equal and op-
posite reaction.

Newton’s second law for swimmers

Newton’s second law refers to a particle. But what hap-
pens when we havea system of particles or an extended
body (not discreet particles), such as a swimmer, acted
upon by forces? Assuming the swimmer is made up of
a system of masses (arms, legs, head, etc.), then the
center of mass (or center of gravity) of this system
moves as if the total external forces applied to the
system were acting on the entire mass of the system
concentrated at its center of mass. Thus, the three
equations of Newton’s second law are still applicable.
However, extended bodies also require a description of
their angular motion. Three additional equations are
necessary:

Mj = Tit aot + 122 + is 22 (5.2)
where M; are the applied torques about each of the
principal coordinate axes, w;, w2, and w3 are the an-
gular velocities about the three axes, and lij are the
moments or products of inertia at time f.

60 Chapter 5

If we know the mass and all the forces acting upon
a swimmer, we can, by applying these six equations,
solve for the motion of a swimmer’s center of mass at
any point in time. But, as we shall see in this chapter,
the forces acting upon a swimmer depend upon ve-
locity, position, and time. Their complexity makes an
exact mathematical representation of them very diffi-
cult, and hence, an accurate solution to the equations
of motion becomes difficult as well. It is these forces,
both resistive and propulsive, that are the main topic
of this chapter.

Although six degrees of freedom (three translational
and three rotational) are required to thoroughly de-
scribe all possible motions of the center of mass of a
swimmer, the main direction of interest is the longitu-
dinal (forward-back) direction. Significant local cyclic
translations and rotations by the arms, legs, head, and
torso occur in all directions, but the major movement
ofthe swimmer’s center of massis along the body’s /on-
gitudinal axis (parallel to the lane lines). If we temporar-
ily limit our discussion to this direction only, then
the following simple equation that relates a swimmer’s
mass and acceleration to force may be stated:

Propulsive forces — Resistive forces

= Mass x Acceleration (5.3)

where propulsive forces are the longitudinal compo-
nents of force generated by swimmers to propel them-
selves forward and resistive forces are the longitudinal
components of force that resist forward motion.

Although this equation oversimplifies the problem
in several ways, this single equation clearly shows that
for swimmers to go faster, they must increase propul-
sive force and/or decrease resistive force. This is no
great surprise, but how that is accomplished takes a
little more thought. And there is one important aspect
of equation 5.3 that must be remembered—seldom do
swimmers generate forces in the exact direction they
want to go (down the lane to the wall). Thus, force
components in the direction of interest must be cal-
culated from the overall propulsive force (Fig. 5.1). The
same applies to the resistive forces.

It may be added that although we distinguish be-
tween propulsive and resistive forces, in reality, we
propel ourselves through the water by creating resis-
tive forces. We move our hands through the water,

pushing or pulling against it. The water resists this mo-
tion, and resistive forces are created. Newton's third
law now comes into play, and an equal and oppo-
site propelling force is created, moving the swimmer
ahead through the water.

Drag and lift forces

When a swimmer moves through water, the water ex-
erts a resistive pressure (always perpendicular to the
body surface) and resistive shear stress (parallel to body
surface) on each individual “local” part (head, arms,
legs, etc.) of the swimmer’s body. Pressure and shear
forces acting upon each local part may be calculated
by dividing the pressure and shear stresses by the ar-
eas upon which they act. Then, these forces can be re-
solved into components along three orthogonal (per-
pendicular to each other) axes. Commonly, one axis
is aligned with the direction in which the local body
part is moving. The force component in this direction
is called drag, and the drag force always points in the
direction opposite to which the body part is moving.
The other two force components can either be com-
bined to create a single force called three-dimensional
(3D) lift (which is still perpendicular to the drag force),
or remain separate as two-dimensional (2D) lift and
axial force (or other description suitable to the appli-
cation). This force component resolution along the
three orthogonal axes is shown in Fig. 5.2. Lift force
is simply a force perpendicular to the direction of motion.
Note that this definition says nothing about how the
lift force was created.

Since the various parts of a swimmer’s body are not
moving in the same direction, the “local” drag and
lift forces for each part are not resolved into the same

lift forces on a swimmer’s body, all local drag and lift
forces should be resolved into the “global” coordinate
system, which is aligned with the swimmer’s motion
toward the wall. A simplified 2D example of this reso-
lution is shown in Fig. 5.3. The true resolution must,
of course, be done in three dimensions.

Aerodynamic body types

Bodies moving through a fluid may be aerodynami-
cally split into two groups: slender bodies and bluff bod-
ies. Examples of slender bodies are flat plates or thin
airfoils at zero angle of attack. Examples of bluff bodies
are thick airfoils, spheres, cubes, or anything else that
presents a rather broad surface to the flow around it.
A slender airfoil rotated to an angle of attack of only
10° becomes a bluff body. A swimmer’s body falls into
the bluff body group. While friction drag is the ma-
jor drag component on a slender body, most of the
drag on a bluff body is form drag (sometimes called
pressure drag). Figure 5.4 shows the percentage of to-
tal drag due to form drag for an airfoil (Re = 4 x 10°
and a = 0) plotted vs. the ratio of the airfoil thickness
(T) to the airfoil chord length (ZL). It is easily seen that

as the ratio of the airfoil thickness to its chord length
gets larger, form drag becomes dominant, even for a
very smooth airfoil. For the extremely bluff shape of
a swimmer, where significant flow separation occurs,
form drag is the dominant drag.

The drag and lift equations
for steady flow

An exact closed form mathematical analysis of the
flow around a submerged or half-submerged bluff
swimmer’s body is effectively prohibited by signifi-
cant boundary layer separation from the body. Ex-
perimental testing has traditionally been used to es-
timate various drag and lift forces on a swimmer,
although recently, as computers have gotten faster, a
technique called computational fluid dynamics (CFD)
has emerged as an alternative and supplement to ex-
perimental testing. This technique is discussed later in
this chapter.

For a totally submerged bluff object in steady flow
conditions and away from the water surface, the re-
sults of either an experimental test or a CFD analysis
are usually plots of the drag coefficient Cp and lift co-
efficient C, vs. Reynolds number. An example of such
a plot, made for the drag of a cylinder, is shown in
Fig. 5.5. Similarly shaped curves could be developed
for any bluff object, and for swimmers and any other
bluff object, they would look very similar. Note that
Fig. 5.5 is a log-log plot, and that the relationship be-
tween the drag coefficient and the Reynolds number
is very nonlinear. The drag and lift coefficients are de-
fined as

the “quasi-steady“ approach to estimate hand and
arm forces created by swimmers during the propul-
sive phase of their strokes. Drag and lift coefficients
at various angles of attack for a typical hand or a
hand/arm combined have been determined through
experimental testing in flumes (Schleihauf 1979), tow
tanks (Berger et al. 1995), and wind tunnels (Wood
1977), or by CFD (Bixler 1999; Bixler & Riewald 2002).
Then, usingvideo to estimate the positionandvelocity
of the hand/arm during a typical stroke, the propul-
sive drag and lift force of an accelerating hand/arm
has been calculated using steady-state coefficients for
velocities at “snapshot” time points during the stroke.
This technique is a good first step toward handling un-
steady motion, as it takes into account the changes in
velocity during a stroke. However, it ignores the in-
0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 ertial aspects of the unsteady motion, which can be
T/L significant.

Fig. 5.5, there can be limited ranges of Reynolds num-

drag and lift force as the water resists its motion, and
imparts an equal but opposite force to the water, thus

the “quasi-steady” approach to estimate hand and
arm forces created by swimmers during the propul-
sive phase of their strokes. Drag and lift coefficients
at various angles of attack for a typical hand or a
hand/arm combined have been determined through
experimental testing in flumes (Schleihauf 1979), tow
tanks (Berger et al. 1995), and wind tunnels (Wood
1977), or by CFD (Bixler 1999; Bixler & Riewald 2002).
Then, using video to estimate the position and velocity
of the hand/arm during a typical stroke, the propul-
sive drag and lift force of an accelerating hand/arm
has been calculated using steady-state coefficients for
velocities at “snapshot” time points during the stroke.
This technique is a good first step toward handling un-
steady motion, as it takes into account the changes in
velocity during a stroke. However, it ignores the in-
ertial aspects of the unsteady motion, which can be
significant.

Fluid added mass and the drag
equation for unsteady flow

As a swimmer’s hand moves through a stroke cycle,
accelerating and decelerating, the hand experiences a
drag and lift force as the water resists its motion, and
imparts an equal but opposite force to the water, thus
providing propulsion. Look again at Newton’s second
law of motion (eq. 5.3).

What is the mass m in equation 5.3? The answer
is water and the hand mass itself. The next obvious
question is, How much water? Some water is pushed
by the hand and some flows around the hand. The ad-
ditional mass of water pushed by the hand is called
the fluid added mass or virtual mass, and scientists and
engineers have been analyzing and experimenting for
over 200 years to determine the correct added mass
for various objects moving in either air or water. Ob-
viously, added mass is more significant in water than
in air because of the differences in density.

Added mass can be represented by a nondimen-
sional added mass factor k, which is determined exper-
imentally and is defined as the added mass divided by
the mass of fluid displaced by the object. Research on
added mass began in the late 1700s, with significant
progress made by the early 1800s. Much of the early
research on unsteady flow was done using symmetric

objects at zero angle of attack, and the lift forces in
most cases were zero. Hence, for the moment, we will
focus on drag forces, although similar arguments can
be made for lift forces.

It is possible to write a drag equation for unsteady
flow that includes added mass, assuming a moving
body is well beneath the surface (no wave-making). If
a body is accelerated through water that was initially
at rest, its drag at time t may be written as

Fp = ; pCp VA + kpva (5.6)

where 9 is the fluid density, Cp is the drag coefficient
for steady-state flow, V is the instantaneous velocity
at time t, A is the characteristic area of the body on
which Cp is based, k is the added mass coefficient, also
called the fluid inertial coefficient, V is the characteris-
tic volume of the body on which k is based (usually the
displaced volume of water), and ais the instantaneous
acceleration at time f.

The first term of equation 5.6 is recognizable as the
drag due to steady-state motion. The second term rep-
resents the unsteady effects, Both Cp and K are deter-
mined experimentally. The value of k is variable and
depends upon the state of motion. It is obvious that
a significant testing program would be required to de-
velop accurate and reliable added mass coefficients.
Further complications would develop if k were de-
termined by oscillating acceleration tests rather than
unidirectional acceleration tests. In that case, k would
also be dependent upon the amplitude and oscillation
period of the test apparatus.

It is important to emphasize that equation 5.6 is
valid only when there is no wave drag or compressibil-
ity. This means that it could be applied to the motion
of the hand once it is well under the surface and all
trapped bubbles have fallen away.

It is interesting that equation 5.6 provides a math-
ematical explanation as to why some coaches intu-
itively talk to their swimmers about “grabbing” as
much water with their hands as possible. The more
water that is “grabbed,” the larger the added mass.

Equation 5.6 is valid for an accelerating or decel-
erating body in an initially stationary fluid. For fluid
accelerating around a stationary body, k would be re-
placed by (1 + k), accounting for the additional buoy-
ancy force, pva, mentioned in Chapter 4.

The acceleration number

A less complicated, alternative approach that ad-
dresses unsteady flow was developed by Iversen and
Balent (1951) for unidirectional accelerating or de-
celerating objects (no cyclic oscillation). They deter-
mined that a dimensionless parameter called the accel-
eration number (5) could be correlated to unsteady drag
resistance. This parameter, introduced in Chapter 4, is
equal to aL/ V2, where ais the constant acceleration, L
isa characteristic length, and V is the average velocity
through the unsteady motion.

Comparison: quasi-steady forces
vs. actual unsteady forces

Riewald and Bixler (2001a, 2001b) used CFD tech-
niques to calculate the time-dependent forces in an
accelerating and decelerating hand/arm and compare
them with forces calculated using the quasi-steady as-
sumption. It was shown that even for a mild accelera-
tion of 2 m- s-? (with attack angle of 60°), unsteady
drag and axial forces are significantly different from
quasi-steady forces, while the lift forces from both
methods are more similar. This trend was also seen
for other accelerations and angles.

Riewald and Bixler (2001a) also found simple rela-
tionships between the acceleration number and the
ratio of the average unsteady force divided by the av-
erage quasi-steady force (during a stroke segment of
constant acceleration or deceleration). These relation-
ships allow the calculation of unsteady forces using
steady force coefficients and the acceleration num-
ber. The acceleration numbers used in the analyses
ranged from 0.10 to 0.45. The most disparity between
unsteady and quasi-steady forces occurred for drag,
where for the arms, unsteady drag could be more than
twice the quasi-steady drag, and for the hands, un-
steady drag could be more than 1.5 times the quasi-
steady drag. One interesting discovery was that al-
though swimmers may still be pushing backwards at
the end of their stroke, if their hand and arm are de-
celerating too sharply, the inertia effects of the decel-
eration will dominate to the extent that the swimmer
is producing a negative propulsive force.

The types of drag

We are interested in both drag and lift forces, but dur-
ing the following discussions, we will mainly be refer-
ring to drag. This is only a matter of convenience, as
many of the same principles that apply to drag also ap-
ply to lift. Also, it should again be emphasized that al-
though we sometimes distinguish between propulsive
drag forces and resistive drag forces, in reality, we pro-
pel ourselves through the water using resistive forces.
We move our hands, arms, and feet through the wa-
ter, pushing or pulling against it. The water resists this
motion, and drag and lift forces are created. Newton’s
third law is applicable, and an equal and opposite pro-
pelling force is created, moving the swimmer through
the water. Throughout this discussion of drag, we will
switch between propulsive and resistive drag examples
without comment.

Drag can be categorized in two ways. The first way
is to categorize drag according to what the swimmer
is doing. This gives us either passive drag, which is the
drag swimmers encounter when their body isina fixed
position (such as streamlining off a turn), or active
drag, whichis the drag they encounter when “actively”
stroking and kicking. Although active drag is the most
meaningful of these two, it is impossible to evaluate
analytically at the present. All approaches to date have
been experimental in nature. One way (di Prampero
et al. 1974) has been to add extra known drag incre-
mentally to a swimmer, require them to swim at the
same speed, and then measure Voz uptake for each ex-
tra drag added. By developing an equation that relates
Vo above resting to extra drag, the active drag may be
determined by extrapolating the equation to the base-
line of resting Voz. Swimmers studied by Kolmogorov
and Duplisheheva (1992) also towed bodies of known
drag, but instead of requiring the swimmer to swim ata
constant velocity, they had the swimmers swim at the
maximum velocity possible. Then, knowing the differ-
ence in velocity with and without the towed weight,
they assumed that the power used in both cases would
be the same. That allowed them to back-calculate the
active drag. Probably the best approach to date has
been used by Toussaint et al. (1988), where using the
MAD (Measuring Active Drag) system, swimmers push
off from pads mounted below the surface of the water.
The pads measure the force, and once the pad forces

Resistance and propulsion 65

are integrated over time, they yield the average force
required to overcome the active drag at the swimmer’s
velocity.

The other way to categorize drag is according to what
is causing it (pressure, friction, waves, etc.). This way
presents the most opportunities to quantify the drag,
and thus will be the focus in this book.

Both pressure (normal to the surface) and shear
stresses (tangential to the surface) applied by the water
to a swimmer’s skin and swimsuit may contribute to
dragand lift. Ifwe divide the pressure and shear stresses
by the areas upon which they act, we will get normal
and shear forces. Each of these forces can be resolved
into local drag and lift forces, as shown in Fig. 5.6.
Thereafter, the local forces can be further resolved into
“global” drag and lift forces, as was shown in Fig. 5.3.

The drag due to pressure is, naturally, called pressure
drag, and the drag due to a shear load is called skin
friction drag. There are several types of pressure drag
forces, and even among fluid mechanists there is some
disagreement about how they should be categorized.
Table 5.1 shows the types of drag encountered by a
swimmer using the terminology most commonly em-
ployed by fluid mechanists. The first five are mutually
exclusive, and the last four are alternative definitions
or combinations of the others. Figure 5.7 shows how
all of them are related. Sometimes all of the pressure
drag is called form drag.

The dominant drag encountered by swimmers is
pressure drag, although the others are also important.
Form drag, skin friction drag, interference drag, and
induced drag are usually associated with a Reynolds
number, while wave drag and spray drag are usually
associated with a Froude number. Each type of drag is
discussed in detail later in this chapter.

Factors that affect a swimmer’s drag

Each of the factors in Table $5.2 affects one or all of
the types of drag that swimmers encounter. How this
happens is discussed next. In some cases, the effect ofa
single factor ona single type of drag can be determined,
while in other cases, itis only possible to quantify how
a factor affects total drag.

of a cylinder immersed in a uniform steady inviscid
flow is plotted as a solid line in Fig. 5.8. The sum of this
pressure over the surface of the cylinder resolved into
the direction of motion is zero, resulting in zero drag.
In fact, we know that the flow within the boundary
layer is viscous, not inviscid, and the actual pressure
distribution will be different, resulting in a net drag
force on the cylinder.

For viscous flow around the cylinder, the bound-
ary layer will begin to develop at point 1 in Fig. 5.8.
As the flow moves from point 1 to point 2, the pres-
sure on the surface decreases and the fluid accelerates.
The acceleration of the fluid in the boundary layer
tends to oppose the action of the viscous shear forces,
resulting in the development of what fluid mechanists
call a favorable pressure gradient. Over the rear half of

to increase, slowing down the fluid in the boundary
layer. This increasing pressure has the same effect on
the fluid as viscous shear, developing what mechanists
call an adverse pressure gradient. The fluid near the sur-
face of the rear half of the cylinder now slows down,
and if the adverse pressure gradient is large enough,
it may cause a flow reversal. This flow reversal marks
the point where the boundary layer begins to sepa-
rate, as is demonstrated in Fig. 5.9. The flow reversal
gives rise to vortex (whirlpool) flows in the separated
region, which spin away from the cylinder, creating a
wake like that seen in Fig. 4.4.

The pressure distribution on the cylinder down-
stream from the point of separation is radically
changed by boundary layer separation. Figure 5.8 also
shows the pressure on the cylinder surface downstream
from the separation points for both laminar and turbu-
Jent boundary layers. The pressure downstream from
the separation points is negative, approximately uni-
form, and equal to the pressure at the separation
points, making the sum of the pressure on the rear
half of the cylinder less than the sum of the pressure
on the front half of the cylinder. The net force resultant
on the cylinder is called form drag.

The single largest influence on drag is the condition
of the boundary layer. In a study by Hay and Thayer
(1989), the pattern of water flow around swimmers
was observed by attaching small tufts of highly visible
material at discreet points over the swimmers’ bodies
and observing the movement of these tufts. Separated
flow was revealed by highly varied tuft orientation,
while attached flow was apparent where the tufts were
nicely aligned and lying on the body surface. In two

other studies by Bixler (1999) and Bixler and Riewald
(2002), CFD techniques were used to reveal where the
boundary layer separated from a swimmer’s hand and
arm, and where vortices formed on the downstream
side of a swimmer’s hand and arm (Fig. 5.10).

The fact that some of the flow around a swimmer is
separated has significant consequences for almost all
types of drag. The pressure plots in Fig. 5.8 show that
a turbulent but still attached boundary layer causes
less form drag than does a laminar boundary layer.
The profiles of these two types of boundary layers were
shown in Fig. 4.3, where it was seen that near the sur-
face of a swimmer, a turbulent boundary layer has a
greater velocity than a laminar one. This increased ki-
netic energy, due to turbulent mixing, enables the tur-
bulent boundary layer to better resist an adverse pres-
sure gradient near the surface, thus delaying boundary
layer separation and reducing form drag. This explains
the sudden drop in the drag coefficient seen in Fig. 5.5
at a Reynolds number of about 5 x 10°. This drop is
caused by the boundary layer changing from laminar
to turbulent, delaying boundary layer separation, and
reducing the drag force and drag coefficient. And so we
come to the well-known story of how golf ball dimples
increase the distance the ball will travel. The dimples
trip the boundary layer, making it change from lami-
nar to turbulent, thus delaying boundary layer separa-
tion, lowering form drag, and allowing the golf ball to
travel farther. Incidentally, the dimples increase skin
friction drag, but form drag is so dominant that the
net effect is to reduce overall drag.

Effect of body shape, body size,
and orientation on form drag

Asthesize ofan objectis increased, assuming the shape
and orientation remain the same, the form drag is

increased proportionately, with some adjustments
made for the change in characteristic length in the
Reynolds number. More important are the shape of
an object and its orientation, for variances in these
parameters can greatly affect the boundary layer.

It should now be clear that delaying the bound-
ary layer separation can minimize form drag on any
submerged object. In other words, move the point of
boundary layer separation as close as possible to the
rear end of the object by reducing the adverse pres-
sure gradient acting on the surface of the object. Both
in aerodynamics and swimming this process is called
streamlining. Two extreme cases presented in Fig. 5.11
demonstrate the effect of streamlining, where a flat
plate is either aligned with the flow or perpendicular
to the flow. The total drag is small when the plate is
aligned with the flow, with most of it resulting from
skin friction. An adverse pressure gradient does not de-
velop, there is no separation, and the form drag is neg-
ligible. When the plate is perpendicular to the flow,
skin friction drag is negligible because the fluid imme-
diately separates from the surface, and the total drag,
almost all of it form drag, is very large, much larger
than the skin friction drag.

A striking example that demonstrates the impor-
tance of streamlining is shown in Fig. 5.12. The two
objects (an airfoil and a cylinder) have the same form
drag. Although the airfoil is many times larger than
the cylinder, the streamlined shape of the airfoil keeps
the boundary layer from separating, thus keeping the
form drag equal to that of the very small cylinder. A
final and perhaps more familiar example involves the
icing of aircraft wings. During adverse weather, asmall
layer of ice may collect along the leading edge of air-
plane wings, slightly changing the aerodynamic shape
of the wing and causing early boundary layer separa-
tion. This greatly increases form drag and also reduces
lift. It is hard to imagine that such a little amount of
ice is so important, but wing icing has been respon-
sible for more than a few airplane crashes. Although
the consequences of not streamlining in swimming
are not as severe, swimmers should strive to stream-
line their bodies at all times (starts, turns, strokes, and
even finishes). Any unnecessary side-to-side or up and
down wiggling motions should be eliminated. These
motions essentially enlarge the body size that the wa-
ter “sees,” promote boundary separation, and increase
form drag.

Form drag increases with increased water turbulence.
A swimmer’s drag moving through initially turbulent
water is higher than when moving through undis-
turbed water. Bixler (1999) studied the effects of water
turbulence on propulsive drag using a CFD model of
a hand and arm, and found that form drag increases
if either of these parameters is increased (Fig. 5.13).

flume at the University of Otago in New Zealand has
a turbulence intensity of 1% and a turbulence scale of
0.093 m.

Effect of water temperature on
form drag

The total drag of a swimmer is affected by water tem-
perature in two ways. First, the drag force in equation
5.4 is directly proportional to the density, and since
increases in temperature decrease density, increases in
temperature will also reduce drag. These changes are
very small however, compared to the effect that tem-
perature has on viscosity, because viscosity changes
as much as 15% within the range of water temper-
atures encountered by swimmers (see Table 4.1). As
water temperature increases, viscosity decreases, and
total drag decreases. What proportion of this decrease
should be attributed to form drag is not known, be-
cause viscosity plays a role in several types of drag.

Effect of submergence depth on
form drag

The submergence depth of a swimmer, or parts of a
swimmer, affect drag because the nearness of the free
surface (air—-water interface) influences the flow field
around the swimmer. It is difficult to quantify the
effect depth has on form drag, but it may be confi-
dently stated that an object moving along the surface
encounters less form drag (but more wave drag) than
an object moving well beneath the surface. There are
three reasons why this occurs:

1 There is less underwater body surface upon which a
pressure exists.

2 The elevation of the water surface changes in re-
sponse to pressure changes underwater.

3 The pressure field may be modified continually or
cyclically through a process called ventilation. Venti-
lation occurs when the pressure in the low-pressure
region behind a submerged object falls below atmo-
spheric pressure, and air is sucked into that region to
make a cavity. This process has the effect of reducing
the pressure differential between the front and back of
the object, thus reducing the form drag. :

Skin friction drag

Skin friction drag is the drag on a swimmer resulting
from viscous shearing stresses being applied tangent
to the wetted surface of a swimmer’s body. Conceptu-
ally it is comparable to the friction between two solid
surfaces sliding along each other.

Effect of the boundary layer on skin
friction drag

The boundary layer has a critical effect on skin friction
drag, opposite to its effect on form drag. Skin friction
is zero where the boundary layer has separated. A bluff
(non-streamlined) body will experience less skin fric-
tion drag than a streamlined one because of earlier
boundary layer separation. In spite of this, the swim-
mer should always streamline to minimize form drag,
because any decrease in skin friction caused by non-
streamlining will always be overshadowed by the ac-
companying increase in form drag. If the boundary
layer has not separated, skin friction drag for a lami-
nar boundary layer is much less than for a turbulent
boundary layer.

The tufts study by Hay and Thayer (1989) revealed
that the attached boundary layers of significance on
a swimmer’s body occur on portions of relatively flat
body surfaces such as the torso and thighs. Solutions
for skin friction drag on flat surfaces were among the
first boundary layer problems solved at the beginning
of the twentieth century. The boundary layer solution
developed by Blasius (1908) for steady incompressible
laminar flow parallel to one side of asmooth flat surface
and valid for Reynolds numbers up to approximately
5 x 10° is

Fp = 0.664bpV vL V3 (5.7)

where Fp is the total skin friction drag on the surface,
bis the surface width, L is the surface length, p is the
mass density, v is the fluid kinematic viscosity, and V
is the velocity outside the boundary layer.

Equation 5.7 may also be written using the form of
equation 5.4, containing a friction drag coefficient C;.

Fp = Cy (50 va) (5.8)
where C; = 1.328//Re, A is the wetted area of the
surface, and Reynolds number (Re) is based upon the
length of the surface.

It is also possible to determine the skin friction drag
when a boundary layer is turbulent. Equation 5.9 is
valid for steady incompressible turbulent flow parallel
to one side of a flat surface, and for Reynolds numbers
between approximately 5 x 10° and 10’on smooth
surfaces. The variables are defined the same as they
are in equation 5.7.

Fp = 0.036bpv— 1/5 4/5 y/5 (5.9)

In fact, in a pristine flow environment, the bound-

Swimmers encounter turbulent water and make sud-

almost no laminar flow.

this area.

Effect of body shape, size, and
orientation on skin friction drag

The shape and orientation of a body affect the skin fric-
tion drag by influencing the boundary layer. Any non-
streamlined body shape or orientation that causes
early boundary layer separation will minimize skin
friction drag. The effect of body size on skin friction
drag along flat smooth surfaces may be quantified with
the use of equations 5.7 through 5.10. Laminar and
turbulent frictional drag are proportional to L!/* and
L*/5, respectively. In other words, doubling the surface
length of a swimmer does not double the skin friction
drag. This occurs because the downstream part of the
surface has a thicker boundary layer, resulting in lower
friction drag than on the upstream portion of the
surface.

Effect of velocity on skin friction drag

As with other types of drag, skin friction drag is greatly
affected by the relative velocity of the swimmer to the
water. Equation 5.7 for laminar flow along a flat surface

Resistance and propulsion 73

shows that the skin friction drag is proportional to
(Velocity)?/2, while equation 5.9 shows that the skin
friction drag for a turbulent boundary layer is propor-
tional to (Velocity)?’*.

Effect of acceleration on skin
friction drag

As with form drag, it is difficult to isolate the effects of
acceleration on a single type of drag. The only thing
we can say for certain is that, assuming no transition in
the boundary layer occurs, the skin friction drag will
increase as acceleration occurs.

Effect of surface roughness on skin
friction drag

The surface roughness of a swimmer’s skin and swim-
suit can affect the skin friction drag. A rough surface
results in greater skin friction drag than a smooth
surface, provided that other factors remain constant.
For this reason, some swimmers have started wear-
ing “fast” suits. A separate section devoted just to the
Fastskin swimsuits introduced by Speedo during the
last Olympics is presented later in this chapter. These

est as well as controversy, and the manner in which

Sharkskin or not, the time-honored tradition of
shaving off body hair prior to a big meet still continues
everywhere. Although it has been theorized that shav-
ing increases performance only by enhancing kines-
thetic sensitivity or “psyching up” the swimmer, a
study by Sharp and Costill (1989) appears to show oth-
erwise. They found that swimmers who shaved typi-
cally had an increase in performance. Although it may
betrue thatskin friction drag is smaller than form drag,
friction drag is significant nevertheless.

Oncea boundary layer transitions from laminar flow
to turbulent flow (but is not yet separated), the in-
fluence of surface roughness on skin friction drag is
important only after the Reynolds number reaches a
certain value. If an object is moving at a given speed
V, then a permissible surface particle size k or depth of

a typical boundary layer length on the stomach is ob-
served to be 0.25 m long. If the water temperature is

Solution: For a water temperature of 20°C, v = 1.02 x

= 5.1 x 10°

From equation $.11, k = 4% = 100(0.25)/5.1 x
10° = 0.00005 m = 0,05 mm.

This is the theoretical roughness below which a
swimsuit (or skin) may be considered as “smooth.” In
other words, if a swimsuit or a swimmer’s skin has a
roughness greater than 0.05 mm, then this roughness
will contribute to turbulent friction drag. Exactly how
this surface roughness is defined and determined is
obviously very important, but the various procedures
to accomplish that are beyond the scope of the present
discussion.

Since the 0.05-mm roughness is meaningful only
for turbulent skin friction, the question then becomes:
In those areas where the boundary layer is attached
to the swimmer’s body, is the flow laminar or turbu-
lent? The value of the critical Reynolds number where
the boundary layer transitions from laminar to tur-
bulent depends on surface roughness, the amount

of freestream turbulence, and how quickly pressure
and velocity are changing along the length of the
boundary layer. Typical transition Reynolds numbers
range between 2 x 10° and 4 x 10° for blunt objects
and approximately 5 x 105 for flow along flat surfaces.
These numbers would be reduced to 1 x 10° or less for
situations with significant freestream turbulence.

Since swimmers do indeed encounter a lot of
freestream turbulence from other swimmers and from
themselves, a likely critical Reynolds number for
boundary layer transition would be around 1 x 105
or even less. Therefore, in areas where the flow is still
attached to a swimmer’s body, the boundary layer be-
comes immediately turbulent, and consequently, fric-
tion drag will be influenced by any surface roughness
greater than the critical roughness.

Effect of water density on skin
friction drag

As shown by equations 5.7 and 5.9, skin friction dragis
directly proportional to water density for both a lam-
inar and a turbulent boundary layer.

Effect of water temperature on skin
friction drag

Water temperature affects skin friction through its ef-
fect on viscosity (which varies with temperature). For
laminar and turbulent boundary layer flow, the skin
friction drag is proportional to v'/? and to v-/5, re-
spectively. The relationship of v to water temperature
was given in Table 4.1.

Effect of freestream water turbulence
on skin friction drag

Achange in freestream turbulence can affect when the
boundary layer transitions from laminar to turbulent,
which in turn affects the skin friction drag as previ-
ously described.

Effect of submergence depth on skin
friction drag

If submerged parts of a swimmer are close enough
to the free surface to be affected by ventilation, then
where ventilation occurs, the skin friction will drop to
zero.

Wave drag

Swimmers encounter two types of waves: external
waves, created by wind or other swimmers, and internal
waves, created by themselves.

External waves

Although external waves may be dampened by lane
lines, they still can create a choppy and turbulent wa-
ter surface. In general, as the water gets rougher, swim-
mers’ times get slower. There are four ways by which
rough water may slow down a swimmer:

¢ The fluid flow field (pressure and velocity) around a
swimmer is abruptly changed when a swimmer meets
a wave, This represents an increase in random turbu-
lence of the freestream flow, which, as we saw earlier,
results in increased drag.

¢ The waves deform the water surface so that hands,
head, legs or even the torso enter into the water at
different angles and at different instants in the stroke

ing. The entries into the water by various parts of the
body are not as “clean,” and extra splash or spray is
created. Spray represents another form of drag, which
will be covered in the next section.

generating waves with the largest wavelengths. If the
length of a swimmer is 1.8 m, then A/L = 0.72, well
within the range of where external waves can increase
drag. Although pool swimmers will fortunately not
encounter waves with wavelengths as long as their
bodies, open water swimmers may definitely be af-
fected by such large waves.

Internal waves

The other types of waves encountered by swimmers are
internal (self-generated) waves. The creation of these
waves takes energy, and that energy is supplied by
the swimmer. Thus wave-making is also a type of drag.
The pattern of internal waves is predictable, and is
shown in Fig, 5.15. The earliest analytical account of
these types of waves comes from Lord Kelvin (1887),
who observed them emanating from ships and mod-
eled them as a single pressure point traveling over the
surface of the water. Although very simple, the Kelvin
wave explains many of the features of waves generated
by moving objects, including swimmers.

The V-shaped waves shown in Fig. 5.15, called di-
verging waves, emanate from the swimmer’s body at
an angle from the direction of motion, much like
the waves generated by a ship. Fast swimmers usually
generate either two or three of these waves, depending
on the swimmer, the stroke, and the speed. The most
prominent of these is the first bow wave, so called be-
cause it corresponds to the wave generated at the bow
(forward tip) of a ship. The bow wave emanates from
a point at the front of a swimmer’s head.

The other kind of self-generated waves, also shown
in Fig. 5.15, are called transverse waves. They move
in the same direction as the swimmer, and stretch

this type of wave, and they can be easily seen directly
behind a moving ship. Although swimmers generate
similar transverse waves, they are usually obscured
by the turbulence created by stroking, kicking, the
rolling motion of the torso in the freestyle and back-
stroke, and the up and down motion of the torso dur-
ing the breaststroke and butterfly. In fact, these torso
movements themselves create additional waves and
spray, contributing to the total wave drag. The trans-
verse waves behind a swimmer are best seen when the
torso and arm movements are small, such as when
a swimmer kicks through the water while holding
onto a kickboard or keeping the hands in front of the
body.

Figure 5.16 shows a swimmer’s head half submerged
and moving through the water. In a similar fashion to
the submerged cylinder shown in Fig. 5.8, the maxi-
mum pressure on the head occurs at the front of the
head (point 1). The normalized pressure on the head
then drops as the water accelerates laterally around it,
and becomes negative between points 1 and 2. Thus,
wave drag from the bow wave appears in the form of a
net longitudinal component of the pressure distribu-
tion along the head. The “free” water surface responds
to these pressure changes. The high pressure at the
frontofthe head pushes the water up, creating the bow
wave. Then, where the normalized pressure drops, the
water level drops and moves below the “normal” level.
This “trough” behind the bow wave may permit swim-
mers to breathe during the freestyle without turning
their heads as much as if the water surface were at
the normal level. The remainder of a swimmer’s body,
because it is attached to the head, also affects wave
drag, but it is the bow wave that is most visible.

Firby (1975) noted that some swimmers generate
two sets of diverging waves while others generate

three, depending on the swimmer and the stroke.
The diverging waves from two-wave swimmers em-
anate from their head and their hips, while waves
from the three-wave swimmers emanate from their
head, hips, and ankles. Firby also noted that shorter
freestylers tend to be two-wave swimmers, while taller
ones tend to be three-wave swimmers. Additionally,
he observed that the same swimmer would produce
different wave patterns at different speeds.

Firby’s observations can be explained using princi-
ples of physics. The wavelength a of diverging waves
emanating from an object moving through water is
known to be

A=axV?/g (5.12)
where V is the relative velocity of the water and
the object, and g is the acceleration due to gravity
(9.8146 m-s~?).

For a freestyle swimmer of height 1.9 m and moving
ata velocity of 1.7m-s—!, the wavelength of the diverg-
ing waves would be (3.1416)(1.7)*/9.8146 = 0.92 m. In
other words, starting at the head and moving toward
the feet, a wave will emanate from the body approxi-
mately every 0.9 m. Since the swimmer is 1.9 m tall,
three sets of waves will be seen. A swimmer only 1.7m
tall would emanate only two sets of waves because the
third wave would normally start at 2 x 0.92 m=1.84m
from the top of the head, a distance longer than the
swimmer’s height. This explains why shorter swim-
mers tend to emanate two waves while taller ones em-

etrate the free surface of the water. They are usually

VgL

The Froude number is used because the main forces
at work during the formation of waves are inertia and
gravity forces. Once the Froude number of an object
is known, then the steady-state wave drag may be
determined from the wave drag equation.

Although the magnitude of the wave drag coeffi-

a ship, the general form taken by the drag, with its

(Wigley 1931).

a Froude number of 0.5, and thereafter falls away. It
eventually theoretically drops to zero, but the reality is
that above 0.5, the waves begin to break up and turn
into spray (see the following section on spray drag).

Resistance and propulsion 77

Wigley showed that overall, ignoring the humps
and dips in the wave drag curve, the average wave
drag is approximately proportional to the object
mass multiplied by V°. Considering equation 5.14,
wave drag then is proportional to C+. Wigley (1934)
also showed that the mathematical expression for
steady-state wave-making resistance is of the following

It is worthwhile to pause and consider the shape of
the wave drag coefficient curves in Fig. 5.17. Wave drag
does not monotonically increase. There are “local” val-
leys where, with the right combination of velocity and
swimmer body length, the wave drag drops to a local
minimum. Swimmers moving with the right combi-
nation of body length and velocity could havea Froude
number that would put them in one of these valleys.
If so, they might find that they expend more energy to

Figure 5.17 indicates that these two swimmers would
have approximately the same amount of wave drag, al-
though the senior swimmer is moving 1.33 times faster
than the age group swimmer. This is only possible be-
cause the senior swimmer is tall enough to keep the
Froude number the same as the age grouper. Now let
us examine how individual factors affect internal wave
drag.

will also impact wave drag. Indeed, if you have ever
seen breaststrokers who keep their torso inclined at an
angle ofattack to the water, you will have witnessed the
creation of some very large waves. If the angle of attack
is large enough, the swimmer will actually generate
waves that emanate forward from the body, greatly
increasing the swimmer’s drag. This is exactly what
happens with flat-faced barges as they are towed slowly
through water.

Effect of velocity on wave drag

Velocity, like the length of a swimmer, is a critical part
of wave drag because of its inclusion as a part of the
Froude number. Although the swimming literature to
date contains some research relating wave height to ve-
locity and energy, no experimental or analytical work
has been undertaken to develop curves of Cy vs. Fr for
swimmers.

Effect of acceleration on wave drag

As we have already seen, swimming is usually an un-
steady process. Many authors in the ship building in-
dustry have published results that show how wave drag
varies with acceleration, and in some cases, wave drag
was reduced from steady-state conditions by as much
as 30% in accelerated flow. Efimov et al. (1967) com-
pared different rates of acceleration, and found that
wave drag decreases as acceleration increases for Froude
numbers between 0.3 and 0.6. Thus, acceleration af-
fects wave drag in a manner opposite to how it affects
other types of drag. The same trends would be expected
for swimmers.

Effect of surface roughness on
wave drag :

The surface roughness has a negligible effect on wave
drag.

Effect of water density on wave drag

Water density affects wave drag by its role in equation
5.14. Water density can only be significantly changed
through air entrainment, and as mentioned previ-
ously, that effect is difficult to quantify.

Effect of water temperature on
wave drag

Only through its effect on density and viscosity can
water temperature affect wave drag. Since density
varies only slightly with temperature, water temper-
ature has a negligible effect on wave drag through
changes in water density. Many researchers in the field
of naval architecture have attempted to examine the
effects of viscosity on wave drag. Most efforts have
shown that viscosity affects wave drag significantly
only for low Froude numbers (Fr < 0.2), and even then,
they are of secondary importance (Wigley 1962).

Effect of freestream water turbulence
on wave drag ,

The freestream turbulence has a negligible effect on
wave drag.

Effect of submergence depth on
wave drag

An object moving underneath but still near to a free
water surface will still generate wave drag. As the ob-
ject gets farther away from the surface, wave drag di-
minishes rapidly and then disappears altogether. Re-
search on the wave drag of slender spheroidal bodies
moving at various distances under the water's free sur-
face has shown that wave drag becomes zero once the
spheroid depth is greater than five times the width
(Hoerner 1965). If we were to apply this to a swimmer
who is 0.40 m wide at the shoulders, then that swim-
mer needs to be at least 2 m under the surface of the
water before all wave drag disappears. In fact, since the
wave drag asymptotically approaches this.depth, its
magnitude is significantly diminished at only a depth
of 1 m. A study by Lyttle and Blanksby (2000) showed
that a swimmer need be only 0.6 m under water to
eliminate most of the wave drag.

Spray drag

Spray represents another type of drag because it takes
energy to splash water into the air. Although sig-
nificant amounts of spray are made by swimmers,
spray drag has hardly been mentioned in the swim-
ming literature to date. There are two kinds of spray
generated by swimmers: steady-state spray and impul-
sive spray. We will discuss these two types of spray
separately.

Steady-state spray drag

This type of spray is generated steadily over a period of
time, and occurs when waves made by a swimmer (or
any streamlined surface-piercing object) break apart
into a spray. It may be viewed as an extension of wave
drag. This process starts at about a Froude number
of 0.5 (Hoerner 1965) for surface-piercing objects. An
object with a Froude number greater than about 3.0
creates a significant amount of spray, and the drag of
this spray can be rationally calculated, as summarized
by Hoerner (1965). However, the spray drag of objects
with Froude numbers between 0.5 and 3.0 are diffi-
cult to predict. Since the Froude number for the body
of a fast swimmer is usually around 0.5 or less, swim-
mers have small steady-state spray drag compared to
fast-moving ships. However, if you look closely at the
bow wave in front of a swimmer, you will see some
spray on the peaks of the wave, especially during the
sprints.

Resistance and propulsion 79

Impulsive spray drag

This type of spray is called impulsive because it is cre-
ated during an instant of time asa result of a sudden dy-
namic event. Examples would be an arm or hand slap-
ping the water during entry, kicking feet, or the hand
stroking too closely to the water’s free surface, creating
a splash of water. Impulsive spray drag for swimmers is
almost always cyclical. Although a swimmer’s Froude
number is not large enough for significant full-blown
steady-state spray drag to occur, the same cannot be
said of impulsive spray drag. Indeed, almost all the
splash and spray seen around swimmers’ hands, arms,
and legs may be classified as impulsive spray, caused
by the sudden movement of parts of aswimmer’s body
either into or out of the water. However, even less is
known about this impulsive spray drag than is known
about steady-state spray drag. Most of the information
available comes from very simplified (and inaccurate)
analyses done using inviscid irrotational flow theory,
or from testing done during World War Il and the 1950s
when there was a flurry of government-sponsored re-
search on water entry of bombsand missiles. Although
much of the government research is now unclassified,
it was done, unfortunately, for Froude numbers much
larger than those of a swimmer.

Interference drag

Hydrodynamic interference occurs when the flow
around an object is changed by the presence of one or
more nearby objects. The interference occurs when the
pressure fields of two objects interact with each other,
resulting in a total net drag that is different than the
sum of the separate drag values. Thisincrementin drag
is called interference drag, and its magnitude can be
large. Swimmers encounter two kinds of interference
drag. External interference occurs when one swimmer
swims near another, while internal interference occurs
when one part of a swimmer’s body passes near an-
other part of the same swimmer’s body.

External interference

This usually happens when a swimmer swims in a tur-
bulent wake created by another swimmer. It is also

called drafting. The wake area is characterized by a pres-
sure lower than the surrounding undisturbed water,
and offers less resistance to another swimmer moving
into this area. Drafting can result in a smaller pres-
sure differential between the forward (head) and aft
(toes) portions of the drafting swimmer, resulting in
less form drag. A study at ICAR by Troup (1990) showed
that a drafting swimmer typically expends only 94%
of the energy he or she would expend if swimming
alone.

The aerospace industry has done many tests to de-
termine the interference drag of various objects. Al-
though the drag coefficients from these tests should
not be directly applied to swimmers, the trends in the
tests are worth noting. The results of one study by
Zdravkovich and Pridden (1977) are shown in Fig. 5.18,
where the drag on a cylinder downstream from an-
other cylinder is plotted. Both in-line drafting and
offset drafting were evaluated, and the results show
significant drag reductions in the downstream cylin-
der’s drag coefficient based upon its vicinity to the
leading cylinder. Naturally there were no lane lines in
their experiment, and the obvious question to ask is:
How well does a lane line floating on the surface of

According to the study by Troup (1990), there appears
to be justification for trying to drag off swimmers in

an adjacent lane if they are swimming too close to the
lane lines. It is important to realize that a swimmer’s
wake is 3D, stretching beneath the water’s surface, and
lane lines will not screen out the wake effects that are
beneath the surface.

Another study presented in Hoerner (1965) for a
pair of aerodynamically smooth struts shows that the
downstream strut experiences only increased drag. So
why are the two experiments giving exactly oppo-
site results? The answer rests upon the fact that the
Biermann and Herrnstein tests were made using
shapes where a single strut would have very little
boundary layer separation. But with struts in tandem,
the leading strut created a turbulent flow for the down-
stream strut, causing the boundary layer of the down-
stream strut to separate much earlier than it normally
would. This early separation increased the form drag
greatly (up to a factor of 4 times), and overshadowed
any decrease in drag owing to an initially lower pres-
sure field created by drafting. On the other hand, the
Zdravkovich and Pridden tests were made with bluff
cylinders where the boundary layer separated early,
whether there was one cylinder or two. Consequently,
the boundary layer was not a factor, and the effects of
the pressure differential due to drafting may be clearly
seen.

So which of these two tests would apply to swim-
mers? The answer lies somewhere in between both
sets of data—swimmers will never achieve a negative
drag from drafting as in some cases of the Zdravkovich
and Pridden study. But neither does drafting increase
a swimmer’s drag by up to four times the normal
amount, as in the Biermann and Herrnstein study.
These results demonstrate once again the importance
of the boundary layer and the importance of under-
standing the assumptions made behind any equation,
principle, or experiment.

Finally, one important point usually forgotten is
that for the right amount of separation between two
objects moving together, the drag on the leading ob-
ject may also be reduced.

Internal interference

This type of interference occurs during every single
stroke of any kind. Some examples of this type of in-
terference include the legs kicking in close proxim-
ity to each other, the arms sliding along the chest at
the beginning of the breaststroke recovery, the arms

Induced drag
Induced drag is the drag that is directlyassociated with
lift generation on a 3D object. The word “induced”
comes from the similarity of the fluid flow pattern to
the magnetic field pattern induced by conductors of
electric current. There are many ways to calculate in-
duced drag, and the subject can quickly get complex.

freestyle upsweep and release, the arm alongside the
head during backstroke hand entry, and the hand and
arm near the body just prior to release. There are many
other examples that could also be mentioned.

There are two types of internal interference drag.
The first kind is called transient internal interference drag,
and for swimmers, it involves body parts moving rela-
tive to the water and also moving relative to each other.
All the examples listed earlier are of this type. This type
of interference drag is very difficult to determine, and
certainly it has not been studied for swimmers. The sec-
ond kind, called steady-state internal interference drag, is
easier to determine, and results from one object being
permanently near another object (their relative loca-
tion to each other does not change).

For the moment, let us look at an example from
the aerospace industry of steady-state internal inter-
ference drag. Keys and Wiesner (1975) evaluated the
effects of placing an engine next to the body of a he-
licopter. They found that the drag on the engine was
almost doubled if the engine was placed immediately
adjacent to the helicopter body, but if the engine was
at least half of the engine diameter away from the he-
licopter body, then the interference drag dropped to
zero. This is obviously a huge difference, and it demon-
strates how important interference drag can be.

Transient internal interference drag exists in swim-
ming, but it has not yet been investigated or even
mentioned in the literature. It could very well be, for
example, that swimmers would get maximum propul-
sion by holding their hands and arms in certain ways
when they moved close to the other body parts. But
unfortunately, until research is done, we can say noth-
ing else.

Induced drag

Induced drag is the drag thatis directly associated with
lift generation on a 3D object. The word “induced”
comes from the similarity of the fluid flow pattern to
the magnetic field pattern induced by conductors of
electric current. There are many ways to calculate in-
duced drag, and the subject can quickly get complex.
We will limit our discussion in this chapter to just a few
simple concepts, and refer the interested reader to the
literature for more advanced treatment. It is obvious

Resistance and propulsion 81

that the only parts of a swimmer capable of generat-
ing lift are the hands, arms, legs, and feet. Therefore,
induced drag pertains only to those body parts.

Asa first example, let us use the smooth airfoil shape
shown in Fig. 5.19 to demonstrate how induced drag
is generated. Note that the airfoil is inclined from the
direction of freestream flow by the angle of attack a.
Since the direction of the resultant velocity at the aero-
dynamic center of the airfoil is tilted downward from
the direction of the freestream flow by the angle a,
the lift on the airfoil is tilted by the same angle. This
effectively gives the lift vector a small component of
force parallel to the freestream flow. This is the induced
drag force, as shown in Fig. 5.19.

Induced drag may easily be calculated for smooth
wing shapes with attached flow. But what happens
when that wing approaches an angle of attack of 20°,
or when it is shaped like a hand instead of a wing?
That’s right—the boundary layer separates. So while
Fig. 5.19 provides a nice understandable picture that
demonstrates what induced drag is, it isnot applicable
to swimming. Several techniques, most of them from
the aerospace industry, have been developed to handle
induced drag in complex flow situations. Schemensky
(1973) provides an overall guide, where the flight do-
main is broken into seven regions, each of which is
governed by different equations or methods to predict
induced drag. Three of these regions may be applicable
to swimming, as they occur in the subsonic flow do-
main. The three regions are distinguished by where the
boundary layer separates, and whether it reattaches or
not. Although the details of this study are beyond the
scope of this book, the interested reader is referred to
the aforementioned paper, as well as to a book by Rom
(1992), which is devoted to just high angle of attack

Lift

Most of the factors that cause the drag forces discussed
in the last section also cause lift forces. For example,
the same pressure and skin friction that create a drag
component of force will also create a lift component.
The same principles are at work—only the force is
in a different direction. For unless an object moving
through water is symmetrical and it is moving along
its plane of symmetry, there will be lift generated. And
even then, if the object moves far enough, a series of
vortices will be shed into its wake, resulting in the gen-
eration of alternating positive and negative lift forces.
There has been confusion about lift in the swim-
ming literature, and much ofit stems from an incorrect
perception of whatliftis. Liftis simply a force perpendicu-
lar to the direction of motion. Lift occurs in many places
and on many things. Lift is what tears a roof from a

rotated your hand, it not only wants to move back-
wards (drag), but it also wants to move either up or
down. This is also lift. Lift is NOT limited to just the
simple attached flow around an airplane wing that
causes circulation and generates a lift force. Thatis one
simple form of lift which is not applicable to swim-
ming. There are many other forms of lift. To define
lift merely as the upward force on an airplane wing
would be like saying that the only type of vehicle in
the world is a child’s wagon, and ignore cars, boats,
trains, airplanes, etc. They are all vehicles, but they
provide transportation in entirely different fashions.

Bernoulli’s principle

The type of lift generated by an airplane wing at small
angles of attack may be mathematically described by
Bernoulli’s equation. For more than 30 years, the idea
that Bernoulli’s principle (or equation) can be used
to explain the lift forces generated by swimmers has

been widely accepted by the swimming community.
Bernoulli’s equation may accurately be applied only
to fluid flow that is incompressible, inviscid, and that
flows along a streamline. In fact, as has been shown
by both experiment (Ferrell 1991) and analysis (Bixler
1999), the flow moving over a swimmer’s hand sep-
arates from the hand on the downstream side of the
hand, clearly violating the inviscid flow assumption.

The fact that Bernoulli’s equation is not mathemat-
ically appropriate to describe the flow around a swim-
mer’s hand does not mean that a swimmer does not
generate lift, for lift is indeed generated. As we have
seen earlier, lift is not limited to situations governed
by Bernoulli’s equation. The lift generated by swim-
mers requires more advanced equations and princi-
ples to describe it. The proper equations, well-known
to fluid mechanists, are called the Navier-Stokes equa-
tions, and they govern the motion of compressible vis-
cous fluids. The Navier-Stokes equations are complex
partial differential equations, but even when they are
simplified for incompressible flow, they are still too
difficult to solve for most situations.

The best way to think about lift is in the most general
terms possible, going back to Newton’s laws of motion.
When a swimmer moves a hand in a certain direction,
there will be a reactive force to that motion. This re-
active force is rarely directly in line with the direction
of motion and is composed of both drag and lift force
components. The drag component is opposite to the
direction of the motion, and the lift componentisina
direction perpendicular to the motion. Since a swim-
mer’s hands move in complex patterns, both drag
and lift will always contribute to a swimmer’s propul-
sion. The big question then becomes: How should
swimmers move their hands and arms to obtain.the
maximum propulsive force (toward the wall) from a
combination of drag and lift forces. The section on
propulsion will offer some insight to that question
and others. But before tackling propulsion, there are a
couple of interesting side issues worth addressing that

why:

* Currents—Some badly designed pools have currents

Got whitecaps?

* Lanelines can make a difference too, forifthey are not
large enough, swimmers will encounter more external
wave drag from other swimmers.

* The design of both end and sidewalls affects the reflec-
tion of waves from those walls. Plain walls without
gutters will reflect more waves, as will sidewalls with-
out lane lines strung beside them. The result is more
external wave drag.

* Water depth is a reason often given for a pool be-
ing “fast,” and this we will examine in more detail.
Ideally, a swimming pool is large enough so that the
progress of a swimmer is not affected by anyone or
anything. This is a good idea, but we already know
that external wave drag and wakes from other swim-
mers can affect performance, as can the end and side-
walls of the pool. Can a pool be so shallow that it af-
fects how far a swimmer glides after a dive or a push
off the wall, or even how fast a swimmer moves on
the surface? Turning for answers to mainstream engi-
neering we find the answer is yes, and in fact there
are three ways a shallow pool can affect a swimmer’s
performance:

1 Ground effect is a special case of interference drag.
Ground effect occurs when a moving object, by get-
ting too close to a large fixed object such as a wall
or “the ground,” sees a change in its drag and/or lift
forces. Pilots know about it, as lift increases just before
airplanes touch down on the runway, effectively cush-
ioning their landing. Designers of cars and high-speed
trains also must consider the ground effect on lift as
well. In addition to affecting lift, a “ground” surface
can also affect drag, as was seen earlier with the inter-
ference drag example of the helicopter and the engine.
So, if a pool is very shallow, and a swimmer gets too
close to the bottom surface of the pool on the start and

Resistance and propulsion 83

on the turns, it is possible that both resistive drag and
lift will be increased.

An interesting sidelight concerning ground effect
involves butterfly kicking near the bottom of the pool.
One possible technique that might account for the
propulsion swimmers achieve when butterfly kicking
is the creation and use of a series of vortices shed from
their feet. This will be discussed in more detail in the
section on leg and feet propulsion, but it is mentioned
here because ifa swimmer kicks too near the bottom of
the pool, there may be some type of “ground” effect on
the kicking propulsion. The magnitude of that effect
is difficult to quantify without further research. Since
the width of a vortex wake behind a swimmer can be
as large as 1.5 m, to avoid ground effects during the
butterfly kick would require a pool to be 2 m deep,
giving the swimmer some margin to operate within a
depth band of 1 +0.25 m. Some coaches are convinced
that the ground effect can have a negative effect on
butterfly kicking propulsion, and have trained their
swimmers to perform their underwater butterfly kicks
on their side, such that the vortices shed from their
feet do not encounter the bottom of the pool.

2 Blockage occurs when an object being tested in a
wind tunnel, tow tank, or a flume is too large relative
to the passage that contains it. For example, consider
a model ship held stationary in a shallow flume. The
passage is effectively partially blocked where the ship
is held. The flow cross-sectional area around the ship
is reduced from what it is both behind and in front of
the ship. In order to keep the same amount of water
moving through the flume, the water passing under
the ship must temporarily speed up more than if the
ship were in deep water. Although this need is less-
ened if there is no restriction on the flow width (as if
the ship were in a flume with sidewalls far removed),
some blockage will still exist, and it will increase the
drag on the ship. To avoid this, naval architects believe
that thecross-sectional area of the ship or any other ob-
ject should not exceed 1/200th of the cross-sectional
area of the passage that containsit. If we apply this sug-
gestion to a swimmer whose average submerged cross-
sectional area is 0.08 m?, the cross-sectional area of the
water beneath the swimmer should beat least 16 m2. If
the lane width is 3 m, then the depth required to avoid
blockage is 5.4 m. Since the 5.4-m number was calcu-
lated for passages with sidewalls, and the sidewalls play
a critical role in blockage research, a reduction from

After Speedo introduced the Fastskin swimsuit during
the 2000 Olympics, there was a deluge of exclamations
and accusations, and political maneuvering by more
than a few members of the world swimming com-
munity. Everyone had an opinion, informed or not,
about the suits. The clamor was deafening to those of
us who were interested. Some claimed the swimsuits
were bogus-how could a fabric on your skin possibly
lessen your drag? Others claimed the suits gave their
wearers an unfair advantage. The surface of the Fast-

5.4 to approximately 2.0 m would seem reasonable for
swimmers moving in lanes with no sidewalls.

3 Increased wave drag occurs in shallow water. On the
basis of theory and model experiments, Schlichting
(1934) determined the effect of shallow water on the
wave drag of ships. His research was in shallow wa-
ter with no lateral restrictions (walls). Using his data,
it is possible to estimate how a shallow pool will af-
fect a swimmer’s velocity. Figure 5.20 shows how wa-
ter depth would affect a swimmer who swims at 2 m
- s~] in water of unlimited depth. It is seen that wave
drag is not affected when the water depth is 2 m or
more. Thus, to eliminate either flow blockage or an
effect on wave drag, the pool depth should be 2 m or
more.

To plane or not to plane

Occasionally you will hear a coach or swimmer talk
about planing on the water. Planing means skimming
over the surface of the water, rather than plowing
through it. It is true that some swimmers might ride
slightly higher or lower in the water than others. Dif-
ferences in body density could account for that. Plan-
ing, however, is a different matter entirely. To accom-
plish such a feat would be wonderful, but a swimmer
must reach a Froude number of around 4.0 to do it.
That clearly will not happen, as such a Froude number
would require a swimmer to swim the 50-m freestyle
in approximately 4 s.

The fluid mechanics of swimsuits

After Speedo introduced the Fastskin swimsuit during
the 2000 Olympics, there was a deluge of exclamations
and accusations, and political maneuvering by more
than a few members of the world swimming com-
munity. Everyone had an opinion, informed or not,
about the suits. The clamor was deafening to those of
us who were interested. Some claimed the swimsuits
were bogus—how could a fabric on your skin possibly
lessen your drag? Others claimed the suits gave their
wearers an unfair advantage. The surface of the Fast-
skin suit was designed to mimic the skin of sharks, and
there was even an environmental group outraged that
swimsuits were being made out of real sharkskin. Al-
though the concerns of the environmental group have
been assuaged, there is still much discussion about the
suits. There has, however, been very little said about
how the suits are technically designed to reduce drag.
And that isthe scope of the present discussion—purely
technical. For the moment, leave your prejudices, pol-
itics, financial concerns, and swimming rules behind.

Sharkskin

The scales of a shark are complex. Called dermal den-
ticles, they begin as a stem that rises out of the skin
and then spreads out to lie leaf-like above the skin
of the shark. They are small and closely packed to-
gether, looking something like paving stones, as seen
in Fig. 5.21. The top surface has three to seven ridges
aligned in the direction of flow. The average size of
the scale of a fast-moving shark can range between 0.2
and 0.6mm in length, with variances in size and shape
from species to species and even from one location to
another on the same shark.

Riblets

In the mid-1960s, aerodynamicists began to experi-
ment with surfaces that contained fins or microscopic
surface grooves similar to those seen in fast-swimming
sharks. These grooves are called riblets. The initial re-
search by Liu et al (1966) was followed with work by
Walsh and Weinstein (1978). In the decades that fol-
lowed, many papers were published on the subject,
which showed that riblets can reduce skin friction drag
by as much as 6-8%if the ribletsare of the right sizeand

it flows along the swimmer’s body. Speedo has done
this using the results of the full body CFD analyses
of Bixler (2004). Since the seams “stick up” from the
regular swimsuit surface, their alignment cross-wise to
the water flow could have caused premature boundary
layer separation and increased form drag, as previously
discussed.

Now let us come back to the swimsuit manufacturers
themselves. Some have actually used science to come
up with their swimsuits, but most, as is obvious from
their advertising, simply have just jumped on the “full-
body” bandwagon, with no real science behind their
design. In fact, at least one company has even put
their athletes through testing, with no intention of

and, putting it bluntly, dishonest. So, buyer beware,

termine which companies are honest, and which are
simply trying to snooker you with high-tech words
and pictures.

Propulsion

Although we distinguish between propulsive forces
(forces used to propel us down the pool) and resistive
forces (forces that resist motion in that direction), in
reality, we propel ourselves by creating resistive forces.
We move our hands and feet through the water, push-
ing or pulling against it. The water resists this motion,
and resistive forces are created. According to Newton's
third law of motion, an equal and opposite force is cre-
ated, moving the swimmer ahead through the water. It
is important to remember that swimmers do not have
to move their hands and legs directly backwards to ob-
tain an effective forward propulsive force. Indeed, the
variety of stroke “styles” seen at the elite level of swim-
ming tells us that there is more than one way to reach
the wall.

The motions of a swimmer’s arms and legs are usu-
ally described relative to the swimmer’s body or rela-
tive to the water. The former, used by coaches, is the
most practical way to instruct a swimmer howto move,
while the latter is used when necessary to identify the
propulsive forces involved.

Incompetition, swimmers can swim the backstroke,
breaststroke, butterfly, and freestyle. For the freestyle,
swimmers can swim any way they want to, as long as
they obey a few simple rules such as touching each
wall, and not touching the bottom or grabbing the
lane lines. Although occasionally a swimmer may, for
instance, swim the butterfly during a freestyle race,
almost always swimmers use the front crawl in their
freestyle races. In fact, the terms freestyle and front
crawl have become so synonymous that if you asked
a group of young swimmers about the crawl stroke,
at least some of them would not know what you are
talking about. With that in mind, the front crawl will
herein be referred to as the freestyle.

Arm motions of the four
competitive strokes

Recommended reading for detailed descriptions of
each stroke is the classic text Swimming Fastest by
Ernie Maglischo (2003). Although the purpose of the
present book is not to teach swimming, but rather to
show how the principles of science and engineering
can be applied to swimming, it is still worthwhile to
briefly introduce the four “sweeps” of swimming, as
defined by Maglischo:

1 Outsweep: The initial underwater sweep in the but-
terfly and breaststroke

2 Downsweep: The initial underwater sweep used in
the freestyle and backstroke

3 Insweep: The second sweep used in all the competi-
tive strokes

4 Upsweep: The final sweep of the freestyle and butter-
fly

The outsweep is the first underwater motion for the
butterfly and breaststroke where swimmers move their
hands and arms into a position from which to begin
stroking. There is little, if any, propulsion associated
with this motion, where the hands are moved outside
the shoulders in preparation for making “the catch.”
The catch is the point in a stroke where swimmers
“catch” the water and start using it to propel them-
selves forward.

The downsweep, also mostly a nonpropulsive
sweep, is the first underwater motion for the freestyle
and backstroke. Like the outsweep for the butterfly and
breaststroke, it gets the swimmers’ hands to the point

Hand and arm propulsion

The complexity of the four swimming strokes becomes
apparent after considering how many sweeps there
are, and how the speed and direction of swimmers’
handsand arms change during the path ofasinglearm
stroke (Maglischo 2003). For example, the freestyle has
three different sweeps, and the backstroke has even
more. Complicating the issue is the changing orienta-
tion of the hand relative to the forearm, the forearm
relative to the upper arm, the upper arm to the chest,
and so on.

From previous discussions in this chapter, we know
that the boundary layer separates from the hand and
arm at the velocities (or Reynolds numbers) associ-
ated with swimming. This qualifies the hand and arm
as bluff objects, where the dominant propulsive force
will be form drag (and form lift). Thus, many of the
principles covered in the section on drag and lift can
provide us with a better understanding of how swim-
mers use their hands and arms for propulsion. A sum-
mary of the various aspects of the hand and arm that
affect propulsion are shown in Table 5.3 and are dis-
cussed in more detail in the following paragraphs.

Effect of size and shape of the hand
and arm on propulsion

Swimmers cannot control the size of their hands and
arms, but they can control the shape of their hands.
Since form drag and form lift are dominant, swimmers
should make their hands as flat as possible. Cupping
them orcurving them lessens the propulsive force gen-
erated. Some swimmers hold their thumb away from
their fingers (abducted), while others keep it next to
their index finger. Research by Schleihauf (1979) has
shown that when the thumb is widely separated from
the plane of the fingers, the lift coefficient of the hand
is larger and peaks at a lower angle of attack than when
the thumb is held adjacent to them. Thus, swimmers
who use a significant amount of lift force for propul-
sion may find that an abducted thumb will increase
their propulsion.

In the same study, Schleihauf also determined thata
hand with fingers slightly apart (6 mm or less) offered
equal propulsive drag as when the fingers were held
together. Beyond a 6-mm gap, the propulsive drag was
reduced. However, for propulsive lift, any amount of
gap between the fingers lessened the force. Thus it ap-
pears that the best approach for most swimmers would
be to keep the fingers together.

Takagi et al. (2001) determined drag and lift co-
efficients experimentally by using an array of pres-
sure sensors around a model of a hand. And although
the coefficients were larger than those determined by
other researchers (see next section), the data showed,
like Schleihauf’s data, that an abducted thumb can
create larger lift forces at low angles of attack.

Effect of stroke direction
on propulsion

The stroke direction, combined with the orientation
of the hand and arm, determines what “shape” the
water sees, thus affecting form drag. Together they also
determine how the propulsive force is split into drag
and lift components. This will be discussed further in
the section on orientation.

Swimmers do not always move their hand, forearm,
and arm in exactly the same direction, and the direc-
tion they stroke changes, sometimes gradually, and
sometimes suddenly. There are several possible rea-
sons why these changes occur:

is not solid, it is set in motion by the hand. This wa-
ter, once moving, offers less resistance to the moving
hand, and it has been theorized that swimmers must
either accelerate their hands to keep getting resistive
force from this water, or find “still” water that will offer
more resistance. The still water is found by changing
the direction their hands are moving.

2 It is possible that because of changes in body posi-
tion in the water, the most comfortable stroking direc-
tion may change during a stroke.

3 Changing direction may improve the swimmer’s
“balance,” as they not only move their arms and legs,
butalso rotate their body. In fact, a portion of the hand
and arm motion may be caused by body roll, and may
not be from a conscious effort by the swimmer.

4 Swimmers lengthen the distance their arms and
hands travel by not moving them straight back
through the water. This allows them to get more dis-
tance per stroke.

Effect of orientation of the hand and
arm on propulsion

Orientation is how the hand and arm are positioned
relative to the direction of motion, Orientation, com-
bined with stroke direction, obviously plays a large
part in how much propulsion a swimmer generates.
These aspects have been thoroughly investigated for
steady flow conditions by Wood (1977), Schleihauf
(1979), Berger et al. (1995) Bixler (1999), Bixler and
Riewald (2002), and others.

Wood (1977) determined the drag and lift coeffi-
cients fora human hand and arm using a wind tunnel.
He used four different hand and arm models of very
different shapes, and the arm portion of the model
extended to approximately halfway between the wrist
and the elbow. He avoided boundary interference
from the sting support, and although he prevented
end effects with an attachment plate, forces were mea-
sured only in two dimensions (2D lift), The maximum
projected area was used as a reference for force coeffi-
cient calculations.

Schleihauf (1979) evaluated a model of a hand ina
flume with moving water. He accounted for the drag
of the support arm, but like Wood, he calculated only
2D lift coefficients. Also, he did not adjust for the
interference drag between the hand and the support.
The water turbulence was unknown. The reference

area used for the force coefficients was the maximum
projected area. Schleihauf’s study was especially use-
ful, since after determining the coefficients, he used
video to estimate the position and orientation of a
swimmer’s hand during the various strokes. Then, he
calculated actual forces using the hand orientation
and assuming quasi-steady flow conditions. And al-
though it has since been shown that unsteady mo-
tion of the hand creates forces well beyond those
estimated by the quasi-steady approach, the quasi-
steady approach was the natural first step to take, and
Schleihauf's investigation was thorough, examining
many different variables.

Berger et al. (1995) towed two different models of
a hand and arm through a tow tank. By varying the
depth of their models, they evaluated forces for both
hand alone and hand/arm combined. For a reference
area, they used the total wet surface area. They evalu-
ated forces in three dimensions. However, their model
pierced the surface of the water, creating wave drag as
well as ventilation, which probably somewhat altered
their force coefficients.

Bixler (1999) used the CFD model discussed previ-
ously to evaluate the force coefficients for the hand,
the arm, and the hand/arm combination. This model,
shown in Fig. 5.10, evaluated the effects of velocity,
angle of attack, and water turbulence on drag, 2D lift,
axial, and 3D lift forces and force coefficients.

The results from these four studies have been com-
pared, and in general there is good agreement of the
results. To illustrate these results, drag and lift coeffi-
cients calculated from CFD analysis for just the hand
are shown in Fig. 5.23. Turbulence obviously makes a
difference in drag, while it is less important for lift.

Depending upon its position, the thumb is capa-
ble of acting as a forward slat does in a slotted wing.
Commercial aircraft have slats that are projected in
front of the main wings during landing and takeoff.
These slats, as well as the rear flaps, prevent or delay
boundary layer separation up to much larger angles of
attack, so that larger lift coefficients can be obtained.
This does not mean, however, that a hand should ever
be likened to an airfoil. In fact, the difference between
an airfoil and a hand can be seen easily in what aero-
dynamicists call a polar diagram, which is a plot of the
lift coefficient vs. the drag coefficient for different an-
gles of attack. Figure 5.24 presents a polar diagram for
both a low aspect ratio wing and a swimmer’s hand,

analysis revealed an important fact: for stroke angles
between —45° and +45°, the maximum hand propul-
sion is obtained when the sum of the stroke angle and
angle of attack is approximately equal to 95°. In simple
terms, this means that to maximize hand propulsion,
the palm should be facing directly backwards, toward
the feet, for any stroke angle between —45° and +45°.

Now to the most important question: What stroke
angle provides the most hand propulsion? Asan exam-
ple, Bixler plotted peak hand propulsive force against
stroke angle for a hand velocity of 2m -s~! anda tur-
bulence intensity and turbulence length of 1% and
0.1 m, respectively. For each stroke angle, the angle
of attack that gave the largest propulsive force was
used. This plot, shown in Fig. 5.26, shows that a broad
range of stroke angles (between —75° and +45°) pro-
vide effective propulsion (provided the proper angle
of attack is used with each stroke angle). Furthermore,
the propulsive hand force varies little in this range of
stroke angles, although thereisa slight peak fora stroke
angle of —45°.

Also shown in Fig. 5.26 are the components of lift
and drag that contribute to the total hand propul-
sive force. It is seen that hand propulsive force can
be 100% from drag, 100% from lift, or somewhere in
between. And although not all of these combinations
of stroke angles and angles of attack are practical, this
plot shows clearly again that there is more than one
way to get down the pool. Similar plots were made
for the arm alone (Fig. 5.27), and the arm and hand
combined (Fig. 5.28). For the arm, Fig. 5.27 shows

that there are several possible reasons why swimmers

It must be emphasized that all of these studies were

orientation remained constant during the force eval-

relative to the arm was evaluated. By rotating the

backwards as long as possible during the upsweep
might prolong the propulsion generated by the hand.
However, when that hand begins decelerating, it is im-
perative for the swimmer to turn it sideways and get it
out of the water as soon as possible. See the section on
the effect of stroke acceleration and deceleration on
propulsion.
Effect of hand and arm position
on propulsion
Obviously, the position of the hand and arm during
a stroke is very important. As an example, Fig. 5.29
shows three extremes of the many possible hand and
arm positions during the freestyle. The position with
the dropped elbow is a common position used by
beginning swimmers that does not provide much
propulsion. The straight arm position provides im-
proved propulsion, but is not as efficient as the high-
elbow position for two reasons:
1 The large moment associated with the straight arm
pull requiresmore energy to move the arm through the
water than if the arm were moving closer to the body,
as with the high-elbow pull. A moment is a force times
a distance. In this case, the moment is the propulsive
force of the hand and arm multiplied by the distance
from the shoulder to where the force is acting. When
the arm is closer to the shoulder this distance is less,
the moment is less, and less energy is expended. As
an example, hold some barbells in both hands at your
side. The weight you are supporting is the weight of
the barbells. The force is downward, and there is little
moment associated with supporting the weight, be- Fig. 5.29 Three extremes of hand and arm positions in the

It takes a lot more energy to hold the barbells in this

Another way in which position can affect propul-
sion is the location of the hand and arm relative to
other parts of the body or the water surface. Interfer-
ence drag comes into play when the hand or arm gets
close to the torso (freestyle, butterfly) or head (back-
stroke, breaststroke). Wave drag must be considered at
any point in a stroke cycle where the hand or arms are
near the surface. These effects are, however, difficult to
quantify since no research has been done in this area.

are not active, from strictly a mechanical perspective,
higher stroke velocities are always better, unless by
starting a stroke too fast, a swimmer cannot continue
to accelerate throughout the stroke (see next subsec-
tion).

Effect of stroke acceleration and
deceleration on propulsion

The effects of acceleration and deceleration have been
investigated by Thayer (1990), Sanders (1999), and
Riewald and Bixler (2001a, 2001b). All of them showed
that acceleration (or deceleration) plays a significant
role in propulsion. By accelerating their arms and
hands, swimmers can greatly increase the propulsive
force they are generating.

Thayer conducted sophisticated experimental tests
with a hand model in a flume, and included rota-
tion as well as translation in the test. She found that
the unsteady flow affected drag more than it did
lift. Thayer also determined that the unsteady effects
caused by arm rotation increased drag force beyond
that of steady drag force by amounts between 5 and
15 N during the stroke.

Sanders conducted tests in a tow tank for steady flow
and for the hand accelerating from 0.0 to0.6 m -s~! for
accelerations ranging up to7 m-s~?. Only the effects of
acceleration in the direction of the flow were included.
Sander’s model was submerged to avoid wave drag on
the hand. And although he subtracted the drag of the
hand support alone from the drag of the hand with the
support, interference drag between the hand support
and hand itself was not accounted for. Sanders steady-
state coefficients were smaller than those found by
Schleihauf, Berger, Riewald, and Thayer, and it is not
clear why his results are different. Even so, his results
on a relative basis also showed that acceleration can
have a significant effect on propulsive forces. Also,
since his test setup eliminated wave drag and venti-
lation, the axial component of force on the hand was
allowed to fully develop, and, like Riewald, he found
the axial forces to be significant.

Riewald’s study, using CFD, determined that swim-
mers can actually create a negative propulsive force
if they decelerate their hand and arm too quickly,
even though they still may be moving their hand and
arm backwards relative to the water. The results of
this study were discussed earlier, where the accelera-
tion effects were correlated with the acceleration num-
ber. Like Bixler’s study for steady flow (Bixler 2002),
Riewald investigated which combination of stroke an-
gle and angle of attack provided the most propulsive
forward force, and again, the optimum direction to
stroke was found to be directly backwards with the
hand held at an angle of attack of 90° (palm facing the
feet). Two other facts from the CFD analyses are worth
mentioning:

1 In agreement with Thayer's results, drag and ax-
ial forces are affected by acceleration and deceleration
more than lift forces are affected. So, in an ideal world,
if it were practical, swimmers should stroke in a di-
rection to maximize propulsive drag during accelera-
tion phases of their stroke, and ifand when they must
decelerate their hands and arms, they should rotate
them so that they are using mainly lift propulsion.

2 Second, swimmers should not just focus on hand
propulsion. The arm plays a more important part
than steady-state analysis would indicate during drag-
dominant propulsion. For example, ahand and arm of
0.12 m width and accelerating from 0.5 to 2.0m - s7!
in 0.25 s (6 m - s~2) has an acceleration number of
0.46. Using Riewald’s results, at this acceleration num-
ber the drag force for the hand is 1.55 times that pre-
dicted by the quasi-steady technique, while the arm
drag is more than 2.1 times that predicted by the
quasi-steady technique. The probable reason why the
arm is affected more by acceleration than the hand
is that there is room on the more gradually curved
arm surface for the separation line of the boundary
layer to shift along the surface and change the pressure
profile on the surface. The hand edge is much sharper,
and no significant movement of the boundary layer
separation point can take place.

One of the advantages of the CFD method
(Riewald & Bixler 2001a, 2001b) over most experimen-
tal techniques is the ability to easily visualize the flow
with a variety of graphical techniques. A method used
in wind tunnels to visualize the flow patterns on the
surface of an object is called the oil film technique. Us-

not be desirable.
Acceleration is good-it magnifies the propulsive
force. Deceleration is bad-it can actually result in neg-
ative propulsion even though the hand and arm are
still moving backwards. If you are “dead” at the end
of a race, reduce the starting velocity of your stroke to
the point where you can maintain accelerated motion
through most of the stroke.

Summary of hand and arm propulsion

On the basis of the results that have been presented
herein, there are a few basics concerning hand and
arm propulsion that should be emphasized:

¢ The arm plays an important role in propulsion

* Regardless of the stroke angle at which the arm is
moving, keep the palm of the hand facing directly to-
ward the feet to maximize propulsion.

¢ There are many combinations of stroke angle and
angle of attack that provide propulsive components
from both drag and lift forces. A combination that
results in equal lift and drag forces provides almost
as much propulsive force as a combination that pro-
vides a propulsive force that is based upon 100% drag
(arm moves straight backwards). However, there are

several reasons (finding still water, balancing the body,
lengthening the stroke) why a straight backstroke may
not be desirable.

* Acceleration is good—it magnifies the propulsive
force. Deceleration is bad—it can actually result in neg-
ative propulsion even though the hand and arm are
still moving backwards. If you are “dead” at the end
of a race, reduce the starting velocity of your stroke to
the point where you can maintain accelerated motion
through most of the stroke.

Foot and leg propulsion

When it comes to propulsion research, the legs and
feet have not received nearly the attention accorded
to the hands. Certainly much of this derives from the
fact that the hands generate most of the propulsion.
Still, there are some unique aspects concerning foot
propulsion that are worth exploring.

The three types of kicks used in competitive swim-
ming are the dolphin kick, the breaststroke kick, and
the flutter kick (which is used in both the freestyle and
the backstroke). There are many variations to these
kicks, especially the flutter kick (straight 2-beat, cross-
over 2-beat, 6-beat, etc.). We will not get into the de-
tails of each type of kick, but will discuss the general
characteristics of each of the three kicks.

Kicks provide propulsion and help swimmers to
keep their bodies aligned in the right direction as they
stroke and roll their bodies from side to side. In other
words, they act as stabilizers, especially in the freestyle
and backstroke, where the stroke motion is not sym-
metric about the long axis of the body. They perform a
function similar to that of a sailboat keel. For without
a keel, a fast sailboat would roll right over, much like
what happens to my dog—a Welsh Corgi with a long
body and very short legs—when she gets into a swim-
ming pool. She easily loses her balance while trying to
swim, and rolls over as easily as a log.

Whether or not the legs and feet offer significant
propulsion is a question that often arises. A related
question, assuming that the legs can contribute to
propulsion, is whether they should be used for propul-
sion. Perhaps the energy expended to move the large
leg muscles would be better spent on the arm strokes,
which are the primary source of propulsion.

Obviously, legs do offer some propulsive capabil-
ity when they are used alone—witness the kick sets
that swimmers perform with their arms fixed on kick-
boards. But the speeds involved there are much slower
than those of race speeds. The question really is, can
swimmers push the water backwards with their feet
faster than the arms are pulling the body through the
water while at race speeds. If not, then the feet are not
contributing to the propulsion at race speeds.

The flutter kick

Counsilman (1968) investigated the propulsive effec-
tiveness of the flutter kick. He set up a tow test of swim-
mers and measured the tension in the towing rope
when swimmers were kicking and when they were just
being towed in a streamlined position. The goal was
to see if the tension in the tow line while a swimmer
was kicking was greater, less, or the same as when a
swimmer was not kicking. He found that most swim-
mers’ kicks became ineffective (as indicated by a ten-
sion equal to that of being towed in a streamlined po-
sition) between velocities of 1.3 and 1.5 m-s7!, andin
fact, in some instances, the drag actually increased for
speeds above 1.5 m-s~'. Below 1.3 m- s~!, kicking in-
creased propulsion, as indicated by a reduced tension
in the tow line.

Taking this fact by itself, one might conclude that
kicking isa waste of time in the sprints. However, coun-
tering this argument is that sprinters, by kicking, keep
their legs from dropping lower into the water. Such a
drop would increase the swimmer’s form drag. It may
be that swimmers’ legs, when being towed, take up a
different position than during regular swimming. An-
other possible conclusion is that the slower distance
swimmers can increase their propulsion by kicking
hard. However, from an energy standpoint, this is not
practical in a long race.

So where does that leave us? Another useful study
summarized by Counsilman (1968) compares the en-
ergy cost of swimming (as measured by required oxy-
gen) with legs only, arms only, and with both together.
The results show that above a velocity of 0.95 m-s7!,
it takes more energy to swim with the arms only, while
below 0.95 m - s~!, it takes more energy to swim with
the arms stroking and the legs kicking. This would
seem to imply that kicking legs are indeed useful in

keeping the body horizontal in the water, especially
for the sprints.

Probably the most useful study was one performed
by Hollander et ai. (1988), where using the MAD
system (discussed earlier), they measured forces for
swimmers moving with and without kicking and con-
firmed that kicking did indeed improve performance.

The dolphin kick

The dolphin kick, so-called because the legs move to-
gether like the fluke of a dolphin, goes with the butter-
fly stroke. There are two kick cycles for each arm stroke
cycle. The timing of the kicks relative to the arm mo-
tions is critical. It should be noted that when butter-
flyers are swimming on the surface, not only do their
legs oscillate, but also their upper bodies (especially
women). However, below the surface, the oscillation
is mostly limited to the legs. Various aspects of both
types of oscillations will be addressed in the present
section as well as the following section on body mo-
tion.

The Strouhal number (S) was introduced in Chap-
ter 4 as a dimensionless parameter that is important
when there is some type of frequency associated with
fluid flow. It was defined as

S=nL/V (5.16)
where n is the frequency of the cyclic condition
(cycles - s~!), L is the characteristic length (m), and
V is the velocity (m -s~')

The Strouhal number is a useful parameter for char-
acterizing the motion of a butterfly swimmer, where
the characteristic length could be either the height
of the swimmer or the width of the wake created by
the shedding of vortices from the swimmer’s feet. V is
the average velocity of the swimmer, and nis the rate
(cycles - s~! or Hz) at which the swimmer kicks.

As an example, let us calculate the Strouhal num-
ber for an elite swimmer. If we are interested in the
whole body motion along the surface, then we will
use the swimmer’s height as the characteristic length.
Assume the swimmer is 1.75 m tall and moves at an
average velocity of 1.9m -s~! and takes 1.2 s to com-
plete each arm stroke cycle. This means that a sin-
gle kick cycle would take 0.6 s (assuming that each
kick takes the same amount of time). Therefore the

It is now of interest to compare this wake geometry

has been confirmed by many studies, including one
by Triantafyllou etal. (1991)w ho determined that the

curred at Strouhal numbers of between 0.25 and 0.35.
For his evaluation, Triantafyllou used the width of the

Now let us examine the same swimmer, but turn
our interest to butterfly kicking beneath the surface
(where it is mainly the legs that are moving). In this
case a better parameter for characteristic length would
be the width of the wake created by the vortices shed
from the swimmer’s feet. There has been research ex-
amining the wakes of swimmers, especially for the
butterfly kick. Persyn and Colman (1997) released dye
from the feet of a swimmer doing the butterfly kick,
allowing for a clear visualization of the wake behind
the swimmer. Other studies by Arellano (Arellano
1999; Arellano et al. 2002), where bubbles were re-
leased from the feet, show that the wake width be-
gins at approximately 1 m, but by the time the swim-
mer makes two more kick cycles, it expands to almost
1.5 m. If we use 1.5 as the characteristic length, then
the Strouhal number of the swimmer discussed pre-
viously becomes 1.67(1.5)/1.9 = 1.32. A typical wake
geometry from these studies and others is shown in
Fig. 5.31, where the wake is seen to be composed of
vortices, shed alternatively from one side and then
the other, behind the swimmer’s feet. Note that the
upper vortex, created by the weaker upward kick, is
smaller than the lower vortex, created by the stronger
downward kick.

It is now of interest to compare this wake geometry
and Strouhal number with that of an aquatic propul-
sive system that utilizes oscillating airfoils to generate

by Triantafyllou et al. (1991) who determined that the

curred at Strouhal numbers of between 0.25 and 0.35.
For his evaluation, Triantafyllou used the width of the

With the assistance of Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institute, Triantafyllou then tabulated the Strouhal
numbers of a wide variety of fish, ranging from gold-
fish to sharks, as well as dolphins. Using the width
of the wake behind the fish for the characteristic
length, he determined that all of them swung their
tails with a frequency that gave them a Strouhal num-
ber between 0.2 and 0.4—exactly in the range where
the airfoil propulsive efficiency was optimum (Table

Thus, it appears that the optimum propulsion de-
veloped from either man-made or animal kicking
motions is achieved with a Strouhal number of ap-
proximately 0.3. This is quite different from the 1.3

aforementioned example, an elite butterflyer might
have a Strouhal number of 1.32 with the following
components:n = 1.67 cycles-s~', wake width= 1.5m,
and velocity = 1.9m. s~?. To swim like a fish, the but-
terflyer would need to get the Strouhal number down
to about 0.3. This can be accomplished by changing
any or all of the three components that make up the
Strouhal number. If we just changed the velocity, and
left the wake wide and kick frequency constant, the
velocity would have to increase to 8.35 m - s7!! If we
just changed the kick frequency, it would have to be re-
duced to 0.38 cycles. s~!, which means that each kick
cycle would take 2.63 s and each arm stroke would take
longer than 5.3 s! Finally, if we kept the frequency and
velocity the same and changed the wake width, the
wake width would be reduced to 0.34 m, which corre-
sponds roughly to the feet themselves traveling only
+0.09 m about the axis of the swimmer. None of these
scenarios is even close to realistic, nor is any combina-
tion of changes. We humans were not designed like
fish, so the next time someone suggests that youswim
like a fish, ask them about the Strouhal number.

Having said all that, it is still worth studying how
fish propel themselves, for although we humans were
not designed to swim as efficiently as fish, we may in-
deed, albeit clumsily, use some of the same propulsive
techniques. There is an abundance of research that has
been done on the mechanics of swimming fish, and
it is embarrassingly sophisticated compared to any of
the research that has been done for swimmers. Several
papers for suggested reading are included in the refer-
ences, including some by Frank E. Fish (1993, 1998),
a well-known and appropriately named expert in the
field. Other well-known references on the precise cre-
ation and shedding of vortices in relation to aquatic
animal propulsion are the classic works of Gray (1968),
Lighthill (1975), Wu (1971), Wu et al. (1975), and
Childress (1981).

Figures 5.31 and 5.32 show that the wakes behind a
fish and a swimmer doing the butterfly kick are simi-
lar. The mechanism for fish propulsion is thought to
work as follows: The fish tail swishes outward, form-
ing a vortex, then quickly the tail swishes back in the
reverse direction, producing another vortex. The sec-
ond vortex rotates in the opposite direction from the
first. The two vortices meet, momentum is transferred,
and thrust is generated, either by the first vortex being
canceled out by the second, or by the creation of

a propulsive jet from the combination of the two
vortices. This jet results in a strong forward thrust as
well asa lesser lateral thrust. This is a bit of a simplifica-
tion, but it captures the essence of how the propulsion
occurs. Readers interested in additional comparisons
between dolphins and human swimmers are referred
to Ungerechts et al. (1998). Ungerechts believes that
if human swimmers emphasize the reverse action of
their kicks, using a whip-like action, they are more
likely to generate greater propulsion.

How much of the propulsion generated by a but-
terfly kick is from the proper creation and use of vor-
tices is presently unknown. From Figs 5.31 and 5.32
we know that the wakes behind fish and swimmers
can look somewhat the same. However, from the afore-
mentioned calculations, we also know that a human
Strouhal number is significantly different than those
of dolphins or fish, making it likely that a significant
portion of human propulsion does not come from vor-
tex propulsion. Since the timing of the kicks, the lo-
cations of the vortices, and the speed of the swimmer
must be exactly right for efficient vortex propulsion to
occur, it is more likely that swimmers generate most
of their propulsion from the butterfly kick in the same
fashion that they generate propulsion with their legs
in the flutter kick or with their hands and arms. That
is, by moving their legs and feet through the water at
certain angles and orientations, they create lift and
drag forces, albeit not as large as those from the hands
andarms. This is especially true for swimmers who can
extend their feet to lie along the same axis of their legs
or even beyond.

The breaststroke kick

The breaststroke kick used by most swimmers today
involves a diagonal sweep of the legs through the wa-
ter, where the soles of the feet are the primary propul-
sive surfaces. Because of the orientations and angles
that swimmers must place their legs and feet in to ob-
tain the best propulsion, flexibility of the joints is very
important. There may also be some truth to the opin-
ion that genetics (the structure of one’s legs and feet)
can also play a role in who becomes a good breaststro-
ker. They are often said to “walk like a duck.” Since
a swimmer will accelerate and decelerate more in the
breaststroke than in the other strokes, the timing of the
arms and feet is critical. Maglischo (2003) provides an

excellent discussion of all the nuances involved with
this sometimes difficult stroke.

There are many unique points to the breaststroke,
but one not often discussed is the interaction of breast-
strokers’ legs with their own internal waves. In the
freestyle, backstroke, and butterfly, swimmers will
generate waves (internal wave drag) that continually
emanate from their bodies, and spread out beside and
behind them. They have no “further” interaction with
those waves unless it is at the ends of the pool when
they execute their turns. In the breaststroke, there are
large differences in velocity at different points during
a stroke cycle. Thus, it becomes possible for a trailing
transverse wave (see wave drag) moving at roughly
the same average velocity of the swimmer to actu-
ally “catch up” with the swimmer temporarily dur-
ing a slow point in the cycle. This will possibly in-
crease the pressure loading on the legs or even torsos
of the swimmers, in effect, giving a little extra pres-
sure “push” from behind. A more obvious demonstra-
tion of this phenomenon occurs when a fast-moving
boat, approaching a dock, slows down. The trailing
transverse wave will catch up to the boat and as it
moves ahead of the boat, will give it a bit of forward
motion,

Body motion and position

There are hundreds of things you should not do with
your body. The ones that concern swimming are listed
below. They all result in increased resistive drag or re-
duced propulsive drag.

¢ Excessive up and down motion

* Excessive lateral motion

¢ Horizontal and vertical body misalignment

It has been suggested that perhaps, in the breast-
stroke and butterfly, swimmers can actually get some
additional propulsion by the undulation of their
bodies, where water is accelerated backwards by a
“body wave” that travels toward their feet. Many

investigations have explored this possibility, but prob-
ably the most meaningful study for the butterfly was
conducted by Sanders et al. (1995). Fourier analyses
were made to determine the frequency, amplitude,
and phase characteristics of the vertical undulation
of the head vertex, shoulders, hips, knees, and ankles.
There was a strong relationship between the velocities
of the first Fourier frequency wave and the center of
mass, suggesting that indeed the body was contribut-
ing toa propulsive “whip-like” action. However, unlike
the butterfly study, a similar one done for the breast-
stroke by Sandersetal. (1998) found that the body wave
is probably not propulsive.

Water entry

Water entry refers to the piercing of the water surface
by the hands, head, arms, or any other body part, in-
cluding the start from the blocks. Wave and splash
drag are associated with water entry, and the more
splash you see when a swimmer enters the water, the
larger is the drag associated with entry.

There has been a tremendous amount of research
concerning water entry that has been financed by the
military establishments of various countries around
the world. Some of it is now unclassified, but unfortu-
nately, usually the sizes and velocities involved are too
large to provide information of use to swimmers. The
best rule of thumb is an old one: try to put all parts
of your body “through the same hole” in the water.
Doing this results in less splash, and hence less drag
upon entry.

Swimming theories

There have been several “theories,” related to swim-
mer propulsion. Human nature, being what it is, com-
pels us to create new buzzwords or theories to describe
old phenomena. This happens in every human field
of endeavor. For example, in the business world, by
developing a program of “Continuous Improvement”
or “Total Quality” and adding in some new tools and
buzzwords, we feel we are making progress (as opposed
to just saying that we are going to work harder and

smarter). So it is with swimming propulsion theories.
We have the weaving back theory, the paddle theory,
the Bernoulli theory, and the vortex theory. In fact,
no matter how you move your hands and feet, and no
matter what you call it, it all gets back to Newton’s laws
of motion. Whether you weave your hands in the wa-
ter or pull straight back, it is Newton that will get you
to the wall. Although many still cling to the Bernoulli
theory of propulsion, it has been shown without ques-
tion that it does not apply to swimming. Newton is the
man. Even the vortex theory, which involves transfer
of momentum from one vortex to another, is depen-
dent upon Sir Isacc.

So, having already covered Newton's laws, this au-
thor would prefer to ignore the buzzwords and move
on. However, in good conscience this will not be
done because (1) some of the theories help to em-
phasize certain concepts previously presented, and
(2) some of the theories need exposure as to how, or
even if, they apply to swimming.

Propulsive drag theories focused on how to move
the hands and arms (straight back, s-shaped pull, etc.).
The leader in their developments wasJ.E. Counsilman
(1968). These were followed by the propulsive lift the-
ory wherein the application of Bernoulli’s principle
was presented as the explanation of the lift generated
by swimmers. Counsilman (1971), always looking for
a better understanding of swimming, also led the way
with Bernoulli. Since then, it has been shown exper-
imentally by Ferrell (1991) and analytically by Bixler
(1999) that (1) Counsilman was correct in determining
that swimmers use lift as well as drag to create propul-
sive force, and (2) that the lift generated by swimmers’
hands is not correctly described by Bernoulli’s princi-
ple. This is because Bernoulli’s principle applies only
to ideal flow where the flow remains attached to the
surface, and both Ferrel and Bixler showed that the
boundary layer separates from the surface of the hand.
Even now, there are still those who insist on invok-
ing Bernoulli’s principle because of the misconception
that lift is the type of force generated only by airplane
wings, whereas in reality, lift is merely a force that is
perpendicular to the drag force, no matter how it was
developed.

Colwin (1984) has attempted, using airfoil lift the-
ory, to explain how swimmers generate predom-
inantly lift-force propulsion based upon a vortex

system composed of a starting vortex, a bound vor-
tex, and a trailing or finishing vortex. Simple airfoil
lift theory is based upon inviscid flow, and involves
“circulation” of flow around the airfoil. The vortex
theory suggests that lift-force propulsion is developed
in unsteady flow primarily by the directional changes
of a foil-shaped hand as it moves through the stroke
and sets up the mechanics necessary for creating flow
circulation. This theory requires that swimmers be
skilled and dexterous enough to establish and control
the necessary flow circulation and propel themselves
forward through the rapid generation and shedding
of vortices.

It would be wonderful indeedif we humans had such
control, but there are several reasons why this theory
is not valid:

1 It is one thing to control the flow on a nice smooth
airfoil, but the human hand is a different story. An
airfoil and hand are aerodynamically very different,
as shown by the polar plots of lift vs. drag for a low
aspect ratio airfoil and a human hand (Fig. 5.24).

2 The flow circulation airfoil lift theory and accompa-
nying vortex system exist only for inviscid flow condi-
tions with no boundary layer separation. One excep-
tion is that viscosity must be temporarily taken into
account to explain the formation of the starting vor-
tex, but after that, the calculation of lift based upon
circulation is done using the laws of inviscid flow. The
research of Ferrel (1991) and Bixler (1999), both dis-
cussed previously, has shown that even for low veloci-
ties and low angles of attack, the flow is viscous, with
significant boundary layer separation (Fig. 5.10). This
holds true for either steady or unsteady flow. In fact,
even for simple airfoils, above about a 15° angle of at-
tack, separated flow occurs.

3 The center of mass velocity patterns for swimmers
indicate that swimmers actually decelerate as they
make changes in hand and arm speed and direction
(Maglischo 2003), and usually accelerate to peak ve-
locity during the middle of each propulsive phase of
their underwater armstrokes.

Readers interested in an accurate description of
airfoil lift theory are referred to Schlichting and
Truckenbrodt (1979) or any other introductory book
on aerodynamics. However, readers interested in
swimming propulsion would be better served by a
quick review of Newton’s laws of motion.

Swimming mechanics: where should
we go from here?

We MUST improve our tools to evaluate the mechanics
of swimming. Here are a few suggestions on where,
outside of our little swimming box, we should look to
do that.

* Weshould seek out the testing and analysis expertise
of technical experts in mainstream engineering fields
such as aerodynamics, fluid dynamics, and naval ar-

a tool. There are many, many others.

¢ We should study the results of past research in fields
that are applicable to swimming. The incompressible

been demonstrated by most human swimming scien-
tists. These capabilities have allowed them to advance
their knowledge about animal swimming well beyond
what we know about humans. Let usimprove our math
understanding so we can use more advanced mathe-
matical techniques.

It is hoped that we can advance the state-of-the-art
in swimming mechanics. In doing so, we will make
ourselves less vulnerable to believing every new fad
and every new buzzword that comes along.

Introduction

The belief that psychology plays a role in swimming
and other sports is not new. Over 100 years ago
Dudley (1888) stated that “in all success in athlet-
ics the mental qualities of the athlete figure largely”
(p. 43.). However, just as in the case of the contribu-
tion of physiological factors to sport performance, the
influence of psychology in sport is complex. It has
been recognized that an array of variables can come
into play before, during, and after sport events, includ-
ing both relatively stable factors, such as personality
traits, as well as more transient psychological states
that may change from moment to moment. These
variables may act independently or interact with one
another to either improve or harm performance. Ad-
ditionally, the specific effect of a given psychological
factor may well depend upon the type of sport or the
skill level of an athlete.

Among psychological variables, the personality of
the athlete has been among the earliest topics of study
in the field of sport psychology, and unfortunately,
the results of this research have resulted in unneces-
sary contradiction and confusion regarding the role
that personality plays in sport success. One reason for
this confusion stems from the fact that unlike other
fields of study in exercise science, sport psychology
deals with concepts that are common to human expe-
rience. Unlike concepts such as muscle morphology or
somatotype, virtually everyone has some degree of un-
derstanding of psychological concepts such as person-
ality, stress, and anxiety. Unfortunately lay definitions

of these and other psychological variables may vary
considerably from person to person, and are often in-
consistent with their use within academia. Hence, in
the following sections on psychology, an effort is made
to define crucial terminology in accordance with gen-
erally accepted definitions.

Predisposing psychological factors
in sport performance: personality

Personality has been defined as “relatively enduring
differences among people in specifiable tendencies to
perceive the world in a certain way and in disposi-
tions to react or behave in a specified manner with pre-
dictable regularity” (Spielberger, Gorsuch & Luschene
1983, p. 1). Personality traits are most commonly as-
sessed using so-called pencil and paper questionnaires,
anda variety of validated measures of personality have
been developed and successfully employed in both
general psychology and sport psychology research.
Additionally, a large number of personality and other
psychological measures have been developed specifi-
cally for athletes (Ostrow 1990). Although it has been
proposed that these sport-specific measures are more
useful for research and provide greater application
in sport settings, this contention has not been con-
sistently borne out from the findings of experimen-
tal studies with athletes and there is no compelling
evidence to support the use of psychological mea-
sures to select athletes for sport teams (Raglin 2001).
A primary reason for this lack of effectiveness is that

many of sport-specific psychological measures have
not been developed using rigorously established pro-
cedures that ensure that the measures possess test va-
lidity (APA 1999), and this continues to be a problem
in the field of sport psychology.
Earlyreviews of personalityand athleticism research
findings consistently indicated that athletes differed
in personality structure from nonathletes in several
dimensions. In particular it was found that successful 1

athletes scored higher in measures of extroversion and
emotional stability than less successful competitors
and nonathletes (Warburton & Kane 1966; Cooper

These contradictory perspectives on the relative im-

and other measures of psychopathology (i.e., mental
illness) and mood disturbance. These differences were
generally small in magnitude and in many cases un-
successful athletes were found to score only modestly
better than the population norms of nonathletes for
measures of emotional stability and neuroticism.

On the basis of these findings and other research in-
volving athletes in a variety of sports including swim-
ming, Morgan (1978b, 1980b) developed a “mental
health” model of sport performance. This model pre-
dicts that a negative relationship exists between psy-
chopathology and sport performance, that is, ath-
letes who are depressed, anxious, exhibit disturbed
mood, or other forms of mental illness will perform
more poorly than athletes who possess average or
above average mental health. The prototypical mood
state profile of successful athletes has come to be
identified as the “iceberg profile” (see Fig. 6.1). Most
elite athletes possess this profile the majority of the
time, but it disappears during overtraining. The psy-
chological characteristics associated with successful
athletes have proven stable over time. Recent lon-
gitudinal research (Morgan & Costill 1996) with a
sample of elite distance runners whose psychologi-
cal profiles were contrasted across a span of 20 years
revealed remarkably little change in their psychologi-
cal characteristics, thus indicating that successful ath-
letes continue to have better psychological health
than unsuccessful athletes long after their competitive
years.

Subsequent research by Morgan (1987, 1988) and
other researchers has replicated this work with ath-
letes in a variety of sports, skill levels and age groups,
providing corroborating support for the efficacy of the
mental health model (Mahoney 1989; Newcombe &
Boyle 1995; LeUnes & Burger 2000).

Morgan (1985) later published a summary of re-
search that examined the utility of the mental health
model to accurately identify successful and unsuccess-
ful athletes on the basis of psychological information.
The studies involved samples of athletes in number
of sports, including swimming, and skill level ranging
from college to Olympic caliber. Using validated psy-
chological measures developed in academic psychol-
ogy, personality traits, mood state, and psychological
states were assessed in collegiate and elite athletes and
the resulting psychological profiles were contrasted
between successful and unsuccessful competitors. In
other studies, psychological profiles were used to make
predictions about the future success or failure of ath-
letes vying for positions on Olympic or international
teams (Morgan & Johnson 1978). The results of these
studies indicate that successful athletes generally pos-
sessed Jower scores for such personality factors as in-
troversion, depression, neuroticism, and trait anxiety.
On the basis of psychological information alone, on
average successful and unsuccessful athletes could be
identified at an accuracy of ranging 70-85%, a rate
higher than chance but clearly insufficient for the pur-
pose of selecting athletes. Despite this apparent lack
of practical application, the findings of mental health
model research indicate that it is in the coach’s best
interest to consider not only the physical welfare of
the athlete but also the athlete’s mental health.

As measured by the POMS (Profile of Mood States)
(McNair et al. 1992) the combination of low scores for
undesirable or negative mood factors and a high score
for the positive mood factor has been described as the
“Iceberg Profile” (Morgan 1980a). Most elite athletes
possess this profile the majority of the time, but it dis-
appears during overtraining.

Selecting team members

The effectiveness of the mental health model in iden-
tifying successful and unsuccessful athletes has con-
sistently exceeded chance levels of prediction. On av-
erage, from 70 to 85% of athletes could be correctly
classified on the basis of psychological information.
Despite this level of accuracy, Morgan (1985) cau-
tioned against employing the mental health model in

attempts to select athletes for competition. In virtually
all mental health model research, some false classifi-
cations resulted. Cases in which athletes possess in-
termediate psychological scores preclude categoriza-
tion as either successful or unsuccessful. Moreover, the
level of accuracy achieved with mental health model
studies is insufficient to select athletes, and there is
no evidence that psychological identification mod-
els can be made more accurate (Eysenck et al. 1982;
Vanden Auweele et al. 1993; Morgan 1997). Despite
this, psychological measures have been and continue
tobe used to select athletes for professional sport teams
(Smith 1997).

Training factors: mood state

Research has also shown that psychological variables
in athletes may change in response to significant stres-
sors. In a summary of 10 years of research with swim-
mers and other athletes, Morgan et al. (1987) found
that mood was consistently associated with the cur-
rent level of training athletes were undergoing. In each
of these studies, mood was assessed by means of the
POMS (McNair et al. 1992), a questionnaire that as-
sesses the tension, depression, anger, vigor, fatigue,
and confusion. In the majority of this research, these
factors were combined to yield a single, general mea-
sure of total mood disturbance by subtracting the vigor
score from the sum of the other factors and adding
a constant of 100 to prevent negative values. Moods
have been defined as subjective feelings that are more
transient compared to personality traits that change
little overa lifetime (McNair etal. 1992). Emotionssuch
as anxiety may persist for a very brief period (e.g., a
few seconds) and are often experienced with greater
intensity than moods, which may last from minutes
to weeks.

The results of studies of over 1000 swimmers and
other athletes who underwent mood state monitor-
ing during their training consistently revealed that

Acute mood state responses to
physical training

Not all physical conditioning regimens in swimming
and other sports involve gradual adjustments to the
training load that occur over weeks or months. For ex-
ample, in the case of training camps, three- or fourfold
increases in training volume may be rapidly imposed
over periods as brief as a few days. Several mood state
monitoring studies have been conducted to examine
the psychological responses of swimmers undergoing
such regimens. In these cases the administration of
the POMS is modified in order to assess more acute or
“state” aspects of mood state, and athletes complete
the POMS or other psychological measures according
to how they are feeling “today” or “right now.”

O'Connor etal. (1991) observed the responses of col-
legiate men and women swimmers exposed to period
of increased training from an average of 6800 m of
swimming a day to 12075 m across a 3-day period.
Mood state was assessed using the “today” version of
the POMS each morning, and daily measures were also
taken of muscle soreness, perceived exertion, exercise
heart rate to a paced swim, and salivary cortisol. [t was
found that elevations in mood disturbance occurred
by the second day of increased training, and the re-
sponses were similar for both men and women swim-
mers. Significant elevations in perceived exertion (to-
tal and local) and muscle soreness also were observed,
but salivary cortisol and exercise heart rate were unaf-
fected by the increased training. These results suggest
that mood state as measured by the POMS is a more
sensitive indicator of the strain of acute physical train-
ing than commonly used physiological measures, a
finding that has been replicated in work with distance
runners (Verde et al. 1993).

A slightly longer training protocol was used in a
study conducted by Morgan et al. (1988) to examine
the responses of male collegiate swimmers to a 10-
day period of intensified training. Unlike O’Connor

Mood state responses to training
and the staleness syndrome

It has long been known that not all athletes who un-
dergo an intensive training regimen (i.e., overtrain-
ing) will benefit from it. In studies of swimmers and
other endurance athletes 10-15% have been found to
develop the staleness or overtraining syndrome dur-
ing the course of a season of competitive training
(Morgan et al. 1987; Raglin & Wilson 1999). Staleness
is a condition associated with chronically diminished
sport performance that is not rectified by either reduc-
tions in training or short-breaks from training. A vari-
ety of other signs and symptoms have been reported in
stale athletes and among these include medical prob-
lems such as infectious disorders, sleep disturbances,
changes in appetite, and psychological disturbances,
particularly clinical depression (Morgan et al. 1987;
Kuipers & Keizer 1988; Fry etal. 1991; O’Connor 1997),
Staleness can be avoided if athletes are prevented from
overtraining, but this is not a practical option for se-
rious competitors. Because of this efforts have been
made to identify markers that can be reliably used to
detect staleness in its early stages, with the goal of us-

lems is also warranted. Morgan etal. (1987) have noted
that approximately 80% of stale athletes develop clin-
ical depression of clinical magnitude. These athletes
typically require counseling or psychotherapy, some-
times in conjunction with antidepressant medica-
tion. Appropriate psychological treatment is impor-
tant because there is some evidence implicating a
biological basis for the depression found in stale
athletes (O’Connor et al. 1989). Sport psychologists
have contended that techniques such as mental im-
agery or relaxation can be useful in treating staleness
(Henschen 1997). Empirical tests of these interven-
tions for staleness have not been conducted, however,
and it is recommended that standard medical and psy-

In addition, the responses of these measures may
differ in cases of so-called sympathetic or parasym-
pathetic types of staleness (Kuipers & Keizer 1988).
Physiological measures are generally expensive, time
consuming, and require technical resources beyond
those available to most athletes and coaches.

Psychological measures provide a cost-effective and
timely alternative, and results of mood state monitor-
ing studies indicate that the POMS can discriminate
between stale and healthy athletes. With some excep-
tions (Morgan etal. 1987; Hooper etal. 1997) mood dis-
turbances have consistently been found to be higher
in athletes showing signs of staleness. These find-
ings appear to generalize to younger athletes as well,
and in a report on age group swimmers, Raglin et al.
(2000) report that swimmers who become stale pos-
sessed greater mood disturbance than healthy athletes
at all measurement times during the training season.

There is also evidence that the pattern of mood dis-
turbance differs between stale athletes and those who
are able to tolerate heavy training loads. Research with
college swimmers has revealed that POMS vigor and
fatigue factors scores exhibit the largest shift for most
athletes, whereas depression is relatively unaffected
(Raglin et al. 1991). In contrast, depression increases
the most of all POMS factors in athletes who develop
staleness (see Fig. 6.4).

Psychology 107

The finding that mood responses can be monitored
reliably during overtraining have led researchers to test
the feasibility of monitoring mood state in an effort
to prevent athletes from becoming stale during a pe-
riod of intensive training. Morgan et al. (reported in
Raglin 1993) assessed mood state on a daily basis in
collegiate female and male swimmers who were un-
dergoing overtraining. Total mood disturbance scores
of each swimmer were contrasted with the team daily
and training loads were adjusted for individual swim-
mers whose scores varied from the team average. In
cases in which mood state was at least 1 standard de-
viation above the team average, the training load was
reduced until the total mood disturbance scores de-
clined to a value that differed from the team average
by less than 1 standard deviation. Training distance
was increased in swimmers who exhibited mood state
scores lower than the rest of the team by at least 1 stan-
dard deviation. At the end of the season the swimmers
were evaluated by the coach and no cases of staleness
were reported for the entire sample. While the absence
of staleness may simply be a chance occurrence, this
was unlikely because in each of the previous 10 seasons
the rate of staleness averaged 12% and there were no
seasons in which either the men’s or women’s teams
were entirely free from staleness.

As noted earlier, staleness is commonly associated
with a host of symptoms, some quite serious. Along
with sufficient rest from training, itis important for af-
fected individuals to undergo medical evaluation. Ap-
propriate attention to potential psychological prob-
lems is also warranted. Morgan et al. (1987) have noted
that approximately 80% of stale athletes develop clin-
ical depression of clinical magnitude. These athletes
typically require counseling or psychotherapy, some-
times in conjunction with antidepressant medica-
tion. Appropriate psychological treatment is impor-
tant because there is some evidence implicating a
biological basis for the depression found in stale
athletes (O’Connor et al. 1989). Sport psychologists
have contended that techniques such as mental im-
agery or relaxation can be useful in treating staleness
(Henschen 1997), Empirical tests of these interven-
tions for staleness have not been conducted, however,
and it is recommended that standard medical and psy-
chological treatment be used. Some researchers have
proposed that antidepressant medication could be
given to athletes asa preventive measure (Armstrong &

Precompetition factors: state anxiety

Research has found that acute psychological states re-
sulting from the stress of impending competition can
have a significant impact on sport success. State anxi-
ety responses experienced prior to and during compe-
tition have been considered important psychological
factors in sport performance. Psychological states are
transitory emotions that can change dramatically in
intensity from one moment to the next depending
on the presence or absence of stressors, the perception
and interpretation of these stressors by the individual,
and the ability of the individual to cope with stressors.

The traditional perspective held by sport psycholo-
gists is that high levels of state anxiety are consistently
harmful to performance (Martens etal. 1990; LeUnes &
Nation 1996; Taylor 1996). As a consequence, the tech-
niques employed in the effort to manipulate anxi-
ety to enhance performance are almost exclusively di-
rected toward reducing anxiety and creating states of
relaxation (Taylor 1996). Techniques commonly used
toward this end include hypnosis, progressive relax-
ation, visualization, biofeedback, autogenic training,
meditation, negative thought stopping, and confi-
dence enhancement (Martens et al. 1990).

The perspective that elevated levels of anxiety are
harmful for performance is consistent with several
prevailing theories of anxiety and sport performance,
the most popular being the inverted-U hypothesis
(Martens 1971; Fazey & Hardy 1988; Raglin 1992). Ac-
cording to this explanation, performance is facilitated
when anxiety levels are within a moderate range. As
anxiety extends above or falls below this range, per-
formance should deteriorate at a progressively greater
rate, forming a function in the shape of an inverted-
U. The level of skill of an athlete and the nature of the
sporting event are believed to influence the optimal
moderate range to some degree (Oxendine 1970). As
athletes gain in skillit is hypothesized that they should
benefit from progressively higher levels of anxiety, but
with the inverted-U function being preserved. Con-
versely, it is assumed that beginners or novice athletes
would be most affected by higher anxiety and so the
inverted-U function is moved toward the lower end of
the anxiety continuum. Sport tasks that are explosive
oranaerobic in nature are thought to benefit froma rel-
atively higher level of anxiety compared to endurance
sports, whereas tasks requiring minimal physical ef-
fort and fine motor control (e.g., archery) should re-
quire relatively low levels of anxiety with the inverted-
U function between anxiety and performance being
preserved in all cases.

Despite the intuitive appeal and long-standing pre-
dominance of the inverted-U hypothesis, in recent
years it has fallen under considerable criticism. Re-
views of both the general psychology literature (Neiss
1988) and sport anxiety research have consistently
concluded that the hypothesis is largely invalid, in
part because it fails to account for the individual
differences in anxiety responses that are frequently
observed in sport settings (Raglin 1992; Fazey & Hardy

1992; Hanin 1997). More recent research has pro-
vided support for individualized explanations of the
influence of anxiety on sport performance. In par-
ticular, the Individual Zones of Optimal Function-
ing (IZOF) model developed by the psychologist Yuri
Hanin (1997), based on his research with several thou-
sand athletes, elucidates a relationship between anx-
iety and sport performance that is totally individu-
alized. The IZOF model proposes that each athlete
performs better when her or his level of anxiety falls
within an optimal range or zone. Unlike the inverted-
U hypothesis and other group-based explanations, ac-
cording to the IZOF model optimal anxiety can dif-
fer considerably across athletes in any given sport,
and may range from low to high. In contrast to the
inverted-U hypothesis, the IZOF model posits that the
skill level of an athlete will not predictably influence
the level of anxiety that is optimal for performance. For
example, in a group of swimmers with same skill lev-
els competing in the same event, a substantial percent-
age of individuals should report performing best when
anxiety is high, whereas other competitors will benefit
from moderate or even low anxiety. IZOF research in-
volving athletes from a variety of endurance supports
this prediction. In studies of athletes in swimming and
other sports, it has been found that that between 30
and 45% of individuals perform best with high anx-
iety (Raglin & Hanin 1999), with similar proportions
reporting that they benefit from low or moderate anxi-
ety levels. Optimal anxiety values are most commonly
determined by having athletes complete an anxiety
questionnaire on the basis of how they recalled feel-
ing just prior to their very best performance. Four anx-
iety units (approximately 0.5 standard deviation) are
added and subtracted to this value to yield an optimal
anxiety range. Research indicates that there is a mod-
erate to high correlation (r = 0.60—0.80) between re-
called and actual precompetition anxiety scores, sup-
porting the use of this method for establishing optimal
anxiety (Raglin & Hanin 1999).

anxiety intervention techniques may not be war-
tanted. Some research has been conducted to deter-
mine the degree to which performance is influenced
by optimal anxiety, as established by IZOF method-
ology. In a study with adolescent female swimmers,
Raglin, Morgan and Wise (1990) examined whether

competed with optimal precompetition anxiety lev-

or below the optimal zone). An optimal anxiety zone

(Spielberger etal. 1983) on the basis of how she felt “be-

procedures established by Hanin (1986). Actual pre-
competition anxiety was assessed 1 h before an easy
and a difficult dual meet using the same instrument
with the standard “right now” instructions. The per-
formance of each swimmer was rated by the coach
using a 7-item Likert scale. It was found that athletes
tated as performing above average possessed precom-
petition anxiety levels that were significantly closer to
their optimal recalled score compared with swimmers
who performed average or below. However, the mean
level of precompetition anxiety did not differ between
the above and below average performance groups, and
this lack of a group trend indicates that the impact of
anxiety was individualized and not evident in a group
trend toward higher or lower anxiety. In the case of
the easy meet, the above and below average perform-
ing groups were found to have precompetition anxiety
values that diverged from optimal to an equal degree,
and it was hypothesized that possessing optimal pre-
competition anxiety was not crucial for adequate per-
formance in the case of less important competitions.
Subsequent work by Salminen et al. (1995) also found
that optimal precompetition anxiety had a significant
impact on performance only in the case of difficult
competitions.

In a study that attempted to objectively quantify
the net impact of optimal precompetition anxiety on
sport performance, Raglin and Turner (1993) found
that the performance of trackand field athletes was ap-
proximately 2.0% (P < 0.05) better when anxiety lev-

reversal and catastrophe theory incorporate specific
anxiety or self-reported arousal scales rather than the
more general measures used in most IZOF research. Re-
versal theory (Kerr 1989) contends that self-reported
arousal is important to performance, in spite of prob-
lems noted in the literature. Arousal is interpreted on
the basis of the individual’s current hedonic, or emo-
tional state, which in turn is governed by the interac-
tion of “metamotivational states” that exist in opposi-
tion. These metamotivational paratelic (high arousal

be measured through self-report questionnaires. In
summarizing studies that have tested reversal theory
in several sports, Kerr and Cox (1991) conclude that
more successful athletes report higher levels of arousal
than less successful athletes, but experience it as less

To summarize, anxiety has a significant influence
on sport performance. However, its impact is more
individualized than what is indicated by traditional
approaches, such as the inverted-U hypothesis that
predict athletes competing in the same event should
exhibit similar responses to anxiety. Research indi-
cates that athletes exhibit considerable variation in
the level of anxiety that is most beneficial for their
performance. The IZOF model and other recently de-
veloped theories of sport anxiety do not support the
traditional presumption that high levels of precom-
petition anxiety are uniformly detrimental to perfor-
mance. In fact, popular techniques such as relaxation
to lower anxiety may result in poorer levels of perfor-
mance for a significant percentage of athletes, as be-
tween 30 and 45% report high anxiety as beneficial
for performance. Hence, the indiscriminant use of re-
laxation or any group-based procedure that results in
similar levels of anxiety for an entire team would not
benefit all team members and would potentially be

counterproductive for a substantial proportion of in-
dividuals.

Psychological variables
during competition

Research has identified some cognitive factors that
have an impact on endurance performance. During
competition elite men and women distance runners
commonly utilize a cognitive strategy in which atten-
tion is directed inward in an attempt to monitor bodily
signals. Endurance athletes report paying close atten-
tion to sensations such as pain, fatigue, muscle sore-
ness, respiration, and body temperature (Morgan &
Pollock 1977). This tactic is described as association; it
involves monitoring bodily feedback including kines-
thetic sensations and physical exertion, and using this
information to regulate pace. There are many anecdo-
tal reports of athletes who have had successful sport
performances while associating. In contrast, nonelite
athletes adopt a very different cognitive approach dur-
ing competition (Morgan & Pollock 1977). These indi-
viduals use a variety of means to distract themselves
from the sensations of physical exertion and discom-
fort, a strategy referred to as dissociation. Methods
used to dissociate may range from simple techniques
such as running at the pace of a competitor or repeat-
ing a word or phrase in time with pace (e.g., “down”).
More unusual examples of dissociation that have been
reported include mentally designing and building a
house, reliving one’s entire education, conducting
complex mathematical calculations, and out-of-body
experiences where the runner enters the shadow of
a competitor (Morgan 1997). There is evidence that
dissociation may lengthen the time to exhaustion in
steady state endurance tasks, but Morgan (1997) has
suggested that the use of dissociation during compe-
tition may result in subpar performance.

Some research supports this hypothesis; recre-
ational marathoners who used a dissociative strat-
egy during a race were more likely to “hit the wall”
(Stevinson & Biddle 1998). It was speculated that this
occurred because the runners were not regulating their
pace according to perceived effort and were also under-
hydrated. In contrast, some researchers have claimed
that association is the “riskier” cognitive strategy.

Masters and Ogles (1998) base this contention on their
finding that marathoners who routinely associate
trained harder, performed better, and had a higher in-
cidence of injury than runners who relied on dissocia-
tion. However, the assumption that using association
spurs harder and longer training and consequently
increases the risk of injury could not be established
from the cross-sectional research employed in this
study. It seems feasible that more talented athletes
simply must associate during competition, just asthey
must train long and hard if they are to reach their full
potential.

Elite athletes do not rely exclusively on association
in all situations. Research with elite distance runners
has found that approximately 50% reported dissoci-

lied exclusively on dissociation during competition
(Morgan et al. 1987, 1988).

Athletes may also differ in the degree to which they
monitor bodily feedback accurately during physical
exertion. Morgan and Pollock (1997) reported that
nonelite runners tended to underrate physical exer-
tion during treadmill running when compared with
world-class distance runners. In a study of wrestlers
vying for positions on the US Olympic freestyle team,
Nagle and colleagues (1975) found that unsuccessful
competitors exhibited higher exercise heart rates dur-
ing standardized exercise testing compared with the
wrestlers that were successful in making the team, re-
flecting fitness differences between the groups. How-
ever, perceived exertion ratings did not differ between
successful and unsuccessful wrestlers. Morgan (1997)
has recently theorized that this finding may indi-
cate that elite athletes are more likely to use asso-
ciation on a routine basis, and not simply during
competition. O’Connor (1992) has suggested such
differences may arise from the fact that elite ath-
letes associate because they can afford to monitor
bodily signals, in part because they are more capa-
ble of enduring the discomfort of intense physical
effort.

Some research has been conducted to examine the
influence of association and dissociation in swimmers
(Couture etal. 1999) but this work was marred employ-
ing an association technique that had more in com-
mon with dissociation. Moreover, the study involved
beginning recreational swimmers and its relevance to
competitive swimmers is questionable.

Psychology 111

Imagery confidence

Various psychological strategies have been advocated
to improve sport performance. Among these inter-
ventions, mental imagery or visualization is the most
widely promoted. Yet despite the popularity of this
technique, the benefits associated with imagery ap-
pear to be modest at best. A meta-analysis by Feltz
and Landers (1983) concluded that “mentally prac-
ticing a skill influences performance somewhat better
than no practice at all” (p. 25). Reviews of the literature
consistently indicate the consequences of imagery are
greater for tasks with a significant cognitive compo-
nent, compared to sporting events in which physi-
cal capacity or strength plays a greater role (Feltz &
Landers 1983; Driskell et al. 1994).

It is unclear how low-level physiological activ-
ity (e.g., electromyography, EMG) would benefit en-
durance events where performance is limited more
by physical conditioning than by fine motor skill
or cognitive factors such as memorization. Despite
these caveats mental imagery is still advocated for en-
durance sports, including distance running. In one
study cited as evidence for the use of imagery for run-
ners, Burhans (1988) examined the effects of imagery
or motivational training to a no-treatment control in
adult recreational runners across 12 weeks of training.
The rate ofimprovementinrunninga2.4km (1.5 mile)
race was greatest (P < 0.05) after 4 weeks of training
for the imagery group, but by the end of the training
program the improvement was equivalent across con-
ditions. Unfortunately the authors did not include a
placebo condition. The special attention inherent in
experimental treatments (i.e., the Hawthorne effect)
can alter performance significantly (Morgan 1997),
and may well account for the short-lived benefits of
imagery that were noted in this study. No benefits
were associated with the motivational “psyching up”
strategy and this finding is consistent with other re-
search involving aerobic endurance activities. Other
psychological techniques such as goal setting, arousal
management, and cognitive self-regulation have also
been promoted for athletes. Reviews of this litera-
ture have found that such methods are sometimes

Conclusions

There is considerable interest in uncovering the fac-
tors that contribute to endurance performance. Re-
search to date has largely centered on biological vari-
abies. There is evidence that psychological factors also
impact endurance performance. Selected personality
traits such as emotional stability are associated with
success in a variety of sports. Although these find-
ings should not be used in efforts to select athletes for
competition, they underscore the impact that men-
tal health has on performance—a fact all too often
ignored when considering the needs of the athlete.
Other factors such as anxiety also influence sport per-
formance, but at a much more individual level. These
findings indicate that psychological research on ath-
letes would benefit from considering the influence of
both group and individual factors. Moreover, given
the complex nature of endurance performance, a bet-
ter understanding will come only when psychological
and physiological variables are examined conjointly.
As stated by the pioneering American sport psycholo-
gist Coleman Griffith (1929) some 70 years ago, sport
performance involves “the study of vexing physiolog-
ical and psychological problems, many of which are
distorted by the attempt to reduce them to simple
terms” (p. vii). Griffith’s advice retains its relevance
in the case of swimming.

Asthma

Asthma describes a very common clinical condition
recognized in many young aquatic athletes who have
reached the highest international levels. For athletes,
their parents, and coaches, asthma should not equate
to a life of restricted physical capacity. Contempo-
rary treatment regimes achieve high levels of control,
and the cornerstone to effective asthma management
is education. It is exceedingly important for coaches
and swimmers to be very familiar with the cause of
asthma, its management and, of course, avoidance
of any potential “triggers.” Indoor swimming pools
present additional challenges as a result of the chem-
icals used for disinfection and their subsequent reac-
tion with ammonia from body fluids such as urine and
sweat. Chlorination produces compounds like chlo-
ramines and many other potential irritants that may
provoke respiratory, eye, and skin problems in sensi-
tive swimmers.

What is asthma?

In simple terms, asthma infers an increased sensitiv-
ity of the lining of the airways—a sensitive combina-
tion of hair-lined epithelium, mucus-secreting cells,
and smooth muscle. “Hyperresponsive” or “twitchy”
airways (bronchi) when stimulated produce increased
amounts of mucus, become locally inflamed, and are
caused to constrict as the result of smooth muscle ac-
tion. This latter phenomenon is referred to as “bron-
chospasm.” To the asthmatic swimmer these changes

combine to reduce the cross-sectional area of the
bronchi resulting in restricted lung function and an
audible “wheeze” on forced expiration.

Asthma sufferers are highly sensitive to such things
as dust, pollens, animal fur, cigarette smoke, or cold air.
Frequently there is an accompanying family history of
eczema (dermatitis), hay fever, or seasonal allergy. In
some cases exercise-induced asthma is the working diag-
nosis, reflective of the link with physical activity. Of
all activities though, swimming is widely recognized
as being least provocative—one reason for swimming
to attract such a large number of asthma sufferers.
Contrary to popular misconception it is possible for
a well-controlled asthmatic swimmer to excel; in fact
there are examples of asthmatics winning Olympic
and World swimming titles.

The diagnosis of asthma

Asthma is suspected in anyone for whom breathing
becomes restricted or provoked by any one of the
triggering factors mentioned earlier. On the basis of
such a history a routine medical examination is man-
datory and tests of lung function are necessary to con-
firm an accurate clinical diagnosis. These involve tests
of airway responsiveness to the specific challenges of
hypertonic saline, methacholine, and exercise. Evi-
dence of the reversibility of bronchospasm in response
to specific inhaled drugs requires interpretation by a
specialist respiratory physician before a definite diag-
nosis can be made. Any competitive athlete diagnosed
with asthma must retain a copy of his or her respira-
tory function tests for future declaration at the time of

list of restricted drugs.

Antiasthma drugs

In a general sense, medication to treat asthma is de-
signed to achieve immediate control (“reliever” drugs)
or long-term control (“preventer” drugs). Physicians
base asthma drug management on combinations of
these two types of medication. Relievers are those
that relax smooth muscle and help reduce mucus
production while the preventers are essentially anti-
inflammatory agents.

The current IOC and WADA list permits the use of
the following drugs where the diagnosis of asthma has
been confirmed:

1 Beta-2 agonists (by inhalation only): these are re-
liever drugs

* Salbutamol

¢ Terbutaline

* Salmeterol

* Formoterol

2 Glucocorticosteroids (by inhalation only): these are
preventer drugs

¢ Beclomethasone

* Budesonide

¢ Dexamethasone

¢ Flunisolide

¢ Triamcinolone

It always remains the responsibility of any athlete to check
their medication to ensure that what they have been pre-
scribed is on the permitted list. Your national sports drug
agency has updated information readily available.

Anemia

By definition, anemia describes a reduced number of
red blood cells (RBCs) or a reduction in hemoglobin
(Hb) concentration. A number of factors may be
responsible and the consequence of chronic, un-
treated anemia is inappropriate fatigue, which for the
aquatic athlete frequently translates into an inexpli-
cable loss of form. The Hb component of the RBC has
a strong affinity for oxygen. Tightly bound to Hb and

transported via blood, oxygen is thereby made avail-
able to working muscles. There are several categories
of anemia, classified according to the size of the RBC.
But for the sake of this discussion we will concentrate
on the anemia commonly seen in athletes.

Causes of anemia

Iron is the essential building block of hemoglobin and
this important element should come from daily food
sources. Iron deficiency causes the commonest form of
anemia, in athletes. Microscopically, the RBCs appear
small (microcytic) and pale (hypochromic). Dietary
iron must first be absorbed and then incorporated
into the RBCs (erythrocytes)—part of the process of
RBC manufacture termed erythropoiesis and stimu-
lated by the hormone erythropoietin (EPO) and occur-
ring chiefly in the marrow of long bones and the kid-
ney. Quite simply there are three factors responsible
for this type of anemia: the first is insufficient dietary
iron, the second is poor iron absorption, and third,
iron loss, most frequently by excessive blood loss.

A clinical diagnosis is made on the basis of suspicion
(a history of relevant symptoms) confirmed by phys-
ical examination (revealing typical signs) and appro-
priate investigations (in this case blood tests). In the
case of anemia this is a little more difficult because
swimmers in heavy training although naturally fa-
tigued are not necessarily all anemic. Medical opinion
and laboratory investigations are essential to confirm
the diagnosis. The following case history offers a typ-
ical picture of the anemic athlete.

CASE STUDY

Amy, a 17-year-old competitive swimmer became inexplicably
tired and began to lose interest in her sport and studies because
of extreme tiredness and poor performance. Her moods altered
and she began to shun friends and teammates. At the request
of her parents and coach she accepted medical advice. An as-
tute sports physician asked Amy about her diet and menstrual
pattern. She confessed to becoming “vegetarian” a year earlier
and described menstrual cycles that had become erratic, much
heavier, and very painful over the previous 6 months. Amy had
lost weight (4 kg), looked very pale, and was provisionally diag-
nosed as being anemic due to iron deficiency. Subsequent blood
tests revealed a low Hb level with supportive evidence of depleted
serum iron and iron stores (ferritin).

Amy was commenced on a course of oral iron tablets, given
sound nutritional advice (sources of iron in a vegetarian menu),
and commenced on a low dose, oral contraceptive pill to con-
trol her heavy periods. Within 3 months she responded to the
iron supplementation, her periods became regular and lighter,
and she had incorporated one red meat meal into her weekly
diet. She returned to full swim training and follow-up blood re-
sults showed a significant improvement in Hb levels and iron
stores. Within one season she had regained previous competitive
form.

Treatment of anemia

The mainstay of treating iron deficiency is clearly to
correct theimbalance of iron intake against losses. This
usually involves oral iron supplementation with con-
current administration of vitamin C to enhance iron
absorption. At the same time it is essential that at-
tention be paid to the diet of the athlete. Sources of
iron in the diet are either “heme” (red meats, poul-
try, fish) or “nonheme” (whole grain cereals, vegeta-
bles). The former group is recommended but those
with strong vegetarian beliefs can still achieve signif-
icant iron gains. Foods high in tannin (tea) or phy-
tate (fiber) should be avoided since these block the
uptake of iron. And finally where there is a demonstra-
ble cause of excessive blood loss (such as heavy peri-
ods) it is appropriate to control this mechanism of iron
depletion.

It is important to stress that the inappropriate use
of iron supplements on scant symptomatic evidence
should be strongly discouraged. Excessive iron can
have very serious consequences for individuals with
the inherited disorder of hemochromatosis. About
5-8 individuals in 1000 have this genetic trait, with
a male-female ratio of 5:1. Indiscriminate iron sup-
plementation in these individuals may cause iron-
containing pigment to deposit in the liver, heart,
joints, and the skin.

The ears, eyes, nose, and throat
in swimmers

Exposure to water, frequently chlorinated and often
contaminated by human perspiration, urine, body
lotion, and hair spray, may predispose swimmers to
problems of their upper respiratory tracts, ears, and
eyes. There are a number of conditions that swimmers
and their coaches should be wary of. For the most part
these are preventable or at least eminently treatable if
the early symptoms are recognized.

Swimmer’s ear (otitis externa)

Many microorganisms thrive in a warm, moist en-
vironment. The swimmer’s ear canal provides such
a setting—ideal for the growth of bacteria with ex-
otic names like Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococ-
cus aureus, or Escherichia coli. However, the name of
the organism is far less important than recognizing
the symptoms and acknowledging the need for treat-
ment. Swimmers will experience pain and itching of
the outer ear that frequently invites relief from insert-
ing such things as cotton buds into the ear. This prac-
tice irritates the lining of the canal (causing local dam-
age) and impacts naturally produced earwax, deep in
the canal (Fig. 7.1). Trapped moisture stimulates bac-
terial growth with subsequent infection. Tenderness
of the outer shell of the ear with evidence of localized
skin infection is also acommon accompaniment.

Treatment requires a combination of antibiotic and
anti-inflammatory (corticosteroid) application either
in drop or ointment form. After swimming, the use of
drops of a drying agent is also helpful. A mixture of
equal parts of isopropy! alcohol and acetic acid is fre-
quently prescribed. The additional use of soft earplugs
and well-fitting caps will also protect the ear canal
from moisture. In severe chronic cases it may be nec-
essary to keep the swimmer out of the water for up to
2 weeks. Using a hair dryer to keep the outer canal and
shells of the ear dry is another helpful tip.

Otitis media

Otitis media is an infection of the middle ear chamber.
Swimmers may complain of earache, dizziness, anda
hearing loss. There may be evidence of an associated

After many years of being immersed in water—
especially cool water—many swimmers’ ears develop
what are termed “exostoses.” These are small outcrops
of very hard bone that grow from the inner walls of
the external ear canal. The bone growth, stimulated
by the cool water, may obstruct the canal so that water
becomes trapped. The skin becomes irritated and lo-

Conjunctivitis

Inflammation of the sensitive membrane that cov-

Injury prevention in young
aquatic athletes

Aquatic athletes usually begin training at an early age,
before their musculoskeletal systems have matured.
There is the potential for injury if a young swimmer’s
progress is too rapid or unmonitored. Overuse is the
common injury mechanism for the young swimmer
who is particularly prone to problems of the shoulder
(rotator cuff muscles), the low back, and the knee joint.
Sports physicians now recognize swimming-specific
conditions such as swimmer’s shoulder, butterfly swim-
mer’s back, and breaststroker’s knee. Coaches not only
play an integral part in recognizing the early indicators
of these injuries but they can help to prevent them by
monitoring training load, and also by paying particu-
lar attention to stroke mechanics, weight training, or
other dryland programs. Although this section deals
specifically with injuries in swimmers, the discussion
applies equally to water polo players, synchronized
swimmers, and in many cases divers.

The young skeleton

Because so many injuries have their genesis in younger
swimmers, it is helpful to have an understanding
of the immature musculoskeletal system. The skele-
ton represents a bony scaffold for the attachment of
soft tissues (muscles, tendons, and ligaments). During
preadolescence the skeleton undergoes rapid growth,
a fact of particular significance to injury. Sport-related
injuries are universally classified according to their
mechanism. There are those caused by acute trauma
and those that result from minor, repetitive stress, or
“overuse.” The latter represent the injuries most com-
monly seen in swimming. Their early recognition and
active management will minimize the potential for
chronic disability and interrupted training.

Growth site injury

» At the ends of the long bones are regions called the
epiphyses or growth plates. These are sites of new bone
formation, from which bone length increases. Where
two bones come together, the resulting articulation
is called a joint and there are unique characteristics
associated with the joints of young athletes. Synovial

joints, such as the shoulder, knee, and elbow, possess
a specialized covering of articular cartilage over ad-
jacent bone ends that are primed to accommodate
rapid growth. Like the epiphyses, this cartilage is prone
to damage from repetitive overuse. Any young swim-
mer who complains of pain in the region of a joint or
growth plate deserves medical investigation. Another
site of potential injury in the young swimmer is at the
attachment of tendon to bone. These sites are called
apophyses, and are very vulnerable to the constant pull
or traction of tendons during the repetition of swim
training. A common apophyseal site of overuse is at
the front of the knee where the tendon of the quadri-
ceps (thigh) muscles attaches to the upper tibia (shin).

Overuse injuries

Given their level of activity, all swimmers are at risk
of overuse or repetitive stress injury. Young muscu-
loskeletal systems normally heal very quickly and with
an accurate, early diagnosis, the disruption to train-
ing is usually minimal. Swimmers may present with
overuse injuries such as tendinitis (inflamed tendons)
at sites around the knee joint or shoulder where ten-
don or muscle attachments are exposed to repetitive
traction or pulling forces. Recovery depends upon the
severity of the original injury, correct management,
and the swimmer’s willingness to follow a realistic re-
habilitation program.

Specific sites of swimming injury
The shoulder

Anatomy of the shoulder

Of all the joints in the body, the shoulder is the most
mobile (Fig. 7.3). Itis capable ofan extraordinary range
of movement because of the relationship of the head
of the humerus and the shallow cup (glenoid fossa)
of the scapula that is deepened by a rim of fibrous
connective tissue. A firm capsule, reinforced by thick-
enings (ligaments) that stabilize the joint completes
this “ball-and-socket” relationship. It offers a unique
range of movement in all planes. Understanding the
relationship of the bones, muscles, tendons, and lig-
aments around the shoulder will help the swimmer
and coach respect the potential for injury and recog-
nize the structures most likely to be implicated.

Pain in the shoulder of the competitive swimmer is
common. It may begin with an irritating “niggle” as-
sociated with training or progress to pain that lingers
on after exercise, to become persistent, even at rest.
This latter stage reflects chronic irritation of one or
more of the soft tissue structures around the shoulder.
It is the result of repetitious arm strokes—calculated by
some authorities as about 2 million per year in a seri-
ous competitive swimmer. The tendons of the rotator
cuff, especially the supraspinatus, are commonly im-
plicated in this condition, but the long biceps tendon
is also frequently involved. The resultant inflamma-
tory process may cause thickening of the tendons as
they pass beneath the acromion process causing what
is referred to as an “impingement syndrome” of the
subacromial space.

the symptoms from progressing to the stage of chronic
pain, and disruption of training. This condition is also
reported in the shoulders of water polo players.

The knee

The knee joint is the next most common site of in-
jury in swimmers. In water polo and synchronized
swimming the provocative “egg-beater” kick is a fre-
quent cause of knee pain in much the same way
that the “whip kick” of breaststroke may also provoke
discomfort.

Unlike the shoulder, the knee joint is a “hinge” with
amuch more restricted range of movement limited to
one plane. The flattened upper end (plateau) of the
tibia with two discs of cartilage (menisci) articulates
with the rounded condyles of the lower femur. Four
strong ligaments provide stability to this rather in-
congruous joint. These are the collateral ligaments—
the medial on the inner side of the knee, the lateral
on the outer side, and two internal ligaments that
cross the joint internally. The latter are the cruciate
ligaments—far more frequently injured in the deceler-
ation trauma of weight-bearing sports. Overlaying this
arrangement are the strong quadriceps muscles on the
front of the thigh and the hamstrings, their posterior-
placed counterparts. External to the knee joint but im-
portant to the function of the quadriceps mechanism
is the patella (kneecap), which glides in the intercondy-
lar notch of the femur and is attached above to the
quadriceps tendon and below via the patellar tendon
into the front of the tibia.

Breaststroker’s knee

The specific “whip-kick” action of breaststroke is
widely recognized as the most likely cause of this prob-
lem. The “knock-kneed” or valgus stress demanded by
this kick compares to the stress of the “egg-beater”
action of the kick frequently employed by water
polo players and synchronized swimmers. Repetitive
stretching of the medial collateral ligament causes lo-
calized pain over the inner side of the knee. In some
case’ this may be complicated by damage to the me-
dial meniscus, a diagnosis considered where the pain
is more localized to the medial joint margin or where
theremay be mechanical “locking” of the joint. A third
possible cause of medial knee pain is the common
attachment of three muscles to an area of the upper
medial tibia called the pes anserinus associated with a

small bursa that may also become inflamed and give
rise to very local pain aggravated by any valgus stress,
such as the breaststroke kick. It becomes self evident to
the sufferer of these conditions that continuing aggra-
vation is not an option. Rest from the offending kick-
ing action is essential but the swimmer may maintain
cardiorespiratory fitness using other strokes or “arms
only” and “pull-buoy” drills. Ice massage and physical
therapy modalities are often successful in moderating
acute knee pain and NSAIAs are also indicated with
the usual caution. Apart from the need to excise an of-
fending portion of torn meniscus, the need for surgery
in these cases is not commonly indicated.

Anterior knee pain

Abnormal “tracking” of the patella in its groove on
the femur causes another relatively common source
of pain over the front (anterior) of the knee. This con-
dition is referred to as the “patello-femoral compart-
ment syndrome” caused by repetitious movements of
the kneecap in the flexion/extension kicking pattern
of all four strokes, but particularly breaststroke. Swim-
mers frequently describe pain when they sit for long
periods (also known as “movie-goer’s knee”) or when
they walk up and down stairs. A feeling of “grating” be-
neath the kneecap is a common accompaniment but
bears little reflection on the severity of the problem. In
many, the kneecap is very mobile and theinner belly of
the quadriceps (vastus medialis) is poorly developed.
This creates a pattern of poor “patellar tracking” and
is a well-recognized diagnostic sign more common in
female swimmers.

Treatment of the unstable patella may begin with
specific exercises to correct the pull of the quadriceps
muscles. External forms of bracing have their place but
provide little more than temporary relief if the main
cause is not addressed. Patellar stabilizing braces or
locally applied taping techniques help to realign the
patella but these are interim measures. Symptomatic
relief may also be obtained from the use of ice massage,
physical therapy, or NSAIAs. In rare cases, surgery is in-
dicated for those with grossly unstable kneecaps that
become prone to spontaneous dislocation.

The synchronized swimmer’s lower back

competition include elements that place great stress
on the lumbar intervertebral discs. Where there is an

recognize infection and to mount an appropriate an-
tibody response.

There is a significant body of interesting research ev-
idence to suggest that athletes in heavy training have
a compromised immune response. This is widely re-
garded as one of the causes for athletes becoming more
susceptible to minor infections at times of heavy train-
ing load. Athletes under physical and psychological
stress are said to have a “J-shaped” curve of response
to infection as demonstrated in Fig. 7.5.

The treatment of IM must acknowledge the natu-
ral course of this infection that may leave its legacy of
lethargy formany months. While prolonged bed rest is
not necessary, rest from strenuous training is strongly
recommended. Coach and swimmer must understand
that any attempt to “train through” the convalescent
phase of this condition will simply prolong the symp-
toms. Pressure must come off the athlete to allow the
body’s natural defenses to overcome the viral invader.
In some cases secondary bacterial infections are ap-
propriately treated with antibiotics but there is no ef-
fective antiviral agent currently available to combat
the EB virus. Clinical evidence for the use of intra-
muscular injections of vitamin B12 is purely anecdo-
tal. Current symptomatic treatment of the fever and
acute symptoms still provide the best long-term re-
sults. There must be agreement to allow a natural im-
mune response to proceed without the added insult of
prolonged physical stress. Once the acute symptoms
have disappeared, physical activity is permitted but

Skin conditions

Exposure to a constant moist environment leaves the
skin of the aquatic athlete very prone to various skin
problems. These may include fungal, viral, or bacterial
infections with typical features and characteristic sites
of body involvement.

Fungal infections

Common sites of fungal skin infection are the spaces
between the toes (interdigital spaces) and the groin
region. These conditions are referred to as “athlete's
foot” (tinea pedis) or “jock itch” (tinea cruris) respec-
tively.

A skin scraping examined under UVL will demon-

firming the diagnosis and the need for a topical anti-
fungal agent. In cases of chronic infection involving
the toe or fingernails, a longer course of oral medica-
tion may be required, under the recommendation of
a specialist dermatologist. Occasionally, to relieve the
annoying itch associated with fungal infection the use
of corticosteroid cream may be indicated. Prevention
of infection should still be the goal. Scrupulous drying
between the toes, frequent changes of socks, and the
use of suitable footwear in showers and on pool decks
are simple measures to be encouraged.

Viral skin infections

There are two common sources of potential viral infec-
tion associated with aquatic sports. The first of these is
infection by the human wart virus that is the cause of
plantar warts (verrucae) and the second is the spread
of herpes simplex virus (HSV) from shared towels.
Plantar warts are common on the soles of the feet
where they invade the local dermis and can produce
thickened, painful lesions that may become rather
unsightly. To reduce the risk of transmission, swim-
mers should be encouraged to wear suitable footwear
in the showers and generally around the pool deck
precincts. Treatment options include various topical
applications, the use of cryotherapy, or in some recal-
citrant cases, surgical excision with electric cautery.

Medical issues related to swimming 125

HSV infections, also known as “cold sores,” may ap-
pear as painful blisters that erupt on the face. Com-
monly they occur on the lips but the risk of spread to
the nose or eyes carries an added difficulty in treat-
ment and the potential for serious complication. This

A closely related form of HSV is responsible for lesions
of the genital tract. Antiviral creams are available to
treat HSV or in acute serious cases oral medication is
available that may help to control this troublesome
condition. Medical advice should always be sought if
HSV infection is suspected.

Bacterial infection

Competitive swimmers frequently shave their bod-
ies to reduce drag and this habit has lead to the
recognition of a particular form of skin infection
known as “swimmer’s folliculitis.” Repetitive shaving
reduces natural protective layers of skin and facilitates
infection by microorganisms such as Staphylococcus
or Pseudomonas species. Topical antibiotics are usu-
ally successful in clearing these infections but some-
times there is a need for oral antibiotic therapy, and
this should always be on the recommendation of a
physician.

Urticaria in aquatic athletes

Some open water swimmers may experience a disturb-
ing form of skin reaction on exposure to cold wa-
ter and sunlight. This is called urticaria, a condition
that typically causes an itchy, raised “wheal” on the
skin of athletes with a known allergic tendency. These
skin lesions usually respond to standard antihistamine
therapy taken orally or applied locally. Less-frequent
cases of exercise-induced urticaria deserve to be more
closely monitored and referred for medical opinion,
given their potential for more serious consequences.

been the topic of considerable debate for many years.

very clear and widely publicized stance on drug misuse
based on the established guidelines of the IOC and
the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA). Doping is a

violation of these rules, and all competitive swimmers must
be prepared to submit to doping control both in and out of
competition.

A doping offence is deemed to have occurred if a pro-
hibited substance is detected within a swimmer’s body

ing controlis also deemed an offence. Sanctions are set
by FINA in accordance with an international acknowl-

WADA has taken over the responsibility for estab-

of all coaches and athletes remains the prime objec-

emphasis on education.

Nutritional supplements

An issue of continuing concern is the escalating use of
nutritional supplements by athletes. Products in this
category include a wide range of “natural” products

Before considering the use of any nutritional supplement ath-
letes should always consult an expert in medical and nutritional
matters, and then ask themselves the following questions:

Promoting performance through injury prevention, by
Wayne M. Goldsmith

Injury prevention is an important part of the training plan of ev-
ery coach. Because of the high repetition involved in swimming
training, the injuries that are most common are of the overuse va-
riety. Here are 10 simple tips thal all coaches can use to promote
performance through injury prevention.

1 Develop a network of sports medicine/science specialists: Get
to know your local sports physiotherapist, sports MD, sports mas-
sage therapist, podiatrist, etc.

2 Screening: Prevention is better than cure! Have your local
sports physiotherapist screen your squad for possible problems.
3 Stretching: Stretching is often considered to be nothing more
than an activity during warm-up for injury prevention, However,
stretching has an important role in performance! Increasing the
range of motion of different joints will make for a more efficient
swimmer.

4 Strengthening. One purpose of a strengthening program is to
limit and reduce injuries.

5 Technique: Generally speaking, strokes performed with correct
technique are less likely to cause injury because the movements
are more efficient.

6 Backstroke and kicking: Backstroke has an important role in in-
jury prevention. Using backstroke works other muscles between
long fly and freestyle sets and helps reduce the load on the mus-
cles and tendons of the shoulder. Coaches have also used kicking
to reduce training stresses on shoulders and arms. It is important
that swimmers using boards cross their arms on the board or do

not use a board at all. Kicking with the arms straight out in front
only increases the strain on the point of the shoulder... the very
thing the kick set is supposed to be relieving!

7 Parental education. Parents can be the frontline in injury pre-
vention and management strategy.

8 Massage: Massage is extremely useful in three forms: (1) pro-
fessionally done, (2) swimmers massaging themselves, and (3)
parents massaging swimmers.

9 First aid/medical kit/ice. An important part of every coach's
responsibility is having a well-maintained and up-to-date medical
kit close by at all training sessions, and at all swim meets, AND
being able to administer basic first aid in case of emergency. Ice
should be available at all sessions and meets as part of your
injury prevention and management strategy.

10 Coach education: It is vital that all coaches keep up to date
with current injury prevention strategies and injury management
techniques.

Training and testing of
competitive swimmers

David B. Pyne and Wayne M. Goldsmith

Two of the most common features of training pro-
grams of swimmers competitive are (1) the periodiza-
tion of training volume and intensity and (2) the
transition from training to racing. A periodized train-
ing and tapering program is based on the principle
of overload-recovery—peaking. This principle forms
the basis of preparing swimming training programs
with the aim of increasing the level of competitive
performance. A fundamental principle of preparing
athletes is that periodization and tapering applies
equally to all the different aspects of fitness, such as
endurance, speed, strength, flexibility, and power. The
training program must provide an overload (stimu-
lus) to force the body to adapt to a previously un-
encountered level of stress. After sufficient applica-
tion of the stimulus (in terms of magnitude and fre-
quency), a period of recovery and regeneration will
allow residual fatigue to dissipate. If the processes of
overload and recovery are managed correctly a pe-
tiod of super compensation will occur so that per-
formance is elevated to a higher level for important
competitions.

Periodization can be defined as the division of the
annual training plan into smaller and more manage-
able phases of training. This approach permits one as-
pect of fitness to be the focus of training, while main-
taining the development of other aspects. In essence
a periodized training program is really about being an

training to racing is commonly referred to as the ta-
per and is characterized by a reduction in the volume
of training and the development of race speed. Both
periodization and the taper lead to the peaking of

performance necessary for high-level and interna-
tional competition.

From a physiological viewpoint, there are several
reasons for a periodized and balanced training pro-
gram leading up to major competition:
¢ A higher training load without excessive fatigue.
¢ Faster recovery and regeneration.
¢ Maintaining performances close to their maximum
for a long period of time.

* Correct peaking for the major competition of the
year.

® Maintaining a basic level of fitness over a long pe-
riod of training (or even a period of reduced training).
* A greater degree of specificity for individual events.
¢ Amore efficient and effective taper (and supercom-
pensation) process.

* More complete adaptation to training without two
or three parts of the program interfering with each
other when trained concurrently.

* Better planning for both major and minor competi-
tions.

* More effective integration of sports science support
with the training program.

Periodization

Periodization involves dividing the training plan into
smaller parts using the terms mesocycle, macrocycle,
and microcycle. These terms are used to establish a
hierarchy of training within the overall program. This

Mesocycle

Mesocycle refers to a long-term training phase last-
ing several weeks to months. In swimming this rep-
resents the entire 12-20-week preparation for a ma-
jor national or international competition. Most com-
monly, there are two mesocycles a year with peaks
for the national swimming championships and then
the major international competition (e.g., Olympics,
Worlds, etc.) held later in the year (July-September).
The length of the mesocycle will depend on the spe-
cific training and/or competition objectives for the
mesocycle and the individual swimmer’s current fit-
ness level. It is apparent that coaches of leading in-
ternational swimmers are incorporating more variety
within the macrocycles than a few years ago.

Macrocycle

The term macrocycle refers to shorter training blocks
within the mesocycle. Typically these are 2-4 weeks
in length. The duration of a macrocycle depends on
the objectives and type of training used in each stage
of the annual plan. In physiological terms, the macro-
cycle is used to develop or improve a specific aspect of
fitness. The classical structure of a macrocycle involves
two to four “developmental” or “accumulation”
microcycles (increasing volume) followed by an “in-
tensification” or “tuning” microcycle (increasing in-
tensity). Anumber of macrocycles form a single meso-
cycle. Experience has shown that after several weeks
of intensive or extensive work, most athletes require
some period of recovery (and within macrocycles as
well). There are many types of macrocycle depend-
ing on the requirements of the program, coach, and
athlete. Some examples used by swimming coaches
are the introductory macrocycle (general training, low
volume-low intensity), preparatory macrocycle (tran-
sition from low volume-low intensity to higher vol-
ume training), specific macrocycle (more specialized
higher intensity training, with emphasis on improv-
ing competitive speed), and the competition macrocy-
cle (competitive performance on a single or repeated
basis). In each case, the volume and intensity of work
will vary according to the specific requirements of the
program and individual athlete. The better coaches

(and swimmers) are always aware of “where they are
up to” in the training program. Losing speed and expe-
riencing excessive fatigue and staleness in long and ar-
duous meso- or macro-cycles is not a very efficient ap-
proach to training. Athletes should not struggle with
their training for more than a few days without some
intervention.

Microcycle

The term microcycle refers to a short-term training
block within a macrocycle. The aim of the microcycle
is to target specific components of fitness. Most com-
monly swimming training microcycles are planned
around a standard 7-day training week. Coaches and
athletes are creatures of the modern working week and
most swimmers have to fit their training programs
around work, education, and family commitments.
However, coming in to important meets such as the
Olympics, the training schedule takes precedence and
the day of the week, weekends, and public holidays
become less important. The microcycles represent the
specific plans and strategies needed to achieve the
broader objective of the macrocycle. The microcycle
consists of the individual (daily) workouts based on
the objectives of the macrocycle.

Volume before intensity

One of the fundamental principles that underpins
the periodization of training is that volume of train-
ing is increased before the intensity of training. This
principle applies to meso-, macro- , and microcycles
alike. Most coaches are familiar with the concept that
a foundation of aerobic fitness is established early in
the mesocycle or competition season. After this initial
period of increasing training volume to build endur-
ance, the emphasis of training switches to the devel-
opment of speed and anaerobic capacities. It is of-
ten observed that this base level of fitness can be

off-season. A reasonable level of fitness can be main-
tained on about 30% of the full training volume, i.e.,
a swimmer who normally undertakes 10 training ses-
sions per week, should be able to maintain a base level
of fitness for several weeks by just training three times
per week, In this case, itis important to maintain some
intensity in the work (up to and including threshold
level) when volume and duration are reduced.

This principle of volume first, then intensity, also
applies to strength and muscular endurance. Ina fash-
ion similar to that for endurance training, strength
programs are often based on an initial period of vol-
ume training (lighter weight-many repetitions) before
more intensive training (heavier weight—fewer repeti-
tions) is undertaken. On this basis, a typical 4-week
strength program (e.g., free weights, machine weights,
circuits) for endurance athletes takes the form of a
2-week macrocycle of volume training and then a
2-week cycle of intensity training. While some coaches
and swimmers place a heavy emphasis on strength
training, it is clear that strength alone is not highly
correlated with swimming performance. Other factors
like muscular power, muscular endurance and muscle
elasticity, and of course, swimming technique, should
not be overlooked.

In terms of designing microcycles the “volume first,
intensity second” principle is also valuable. One ap-
proach that we have found to be successful is the use
of 3-day microcycles. A detailed example of a 3-day mi-
crocycle is presented later in this chapter (Table 8.4).
The first variant involves two training sessions a day
for the first 2 days, followed by a single session on the
third day. In some circumstances in swimming, where
three training sessions a day are used, the second vari-
ation takes the form of three sessions a day for 2 days
and then two sessions on the third and final day. In
both versions, the first day is largely aerobic in na-
ture, with a gradual decrease in volume and increase
in intensity as the microcycle proceeds. The emphasis
is on increasing speed from day to day, and athletes
generally find this easier if the training volume is de-
creasing. Many swimmers (and coaches) like to finish
each microcycle with a quality or speed session.

Another feature of planning is the relationship be-
tween duration and intensity. Generally speaking, the
lower the intensity of cycles, the longer the duration,
perhaps up to 7 days. For higher intensity work, shorter
2-4 day training cycles are used. Variation of training

distance and intensity within cycles is important.
Early in the program, microcycles may involve higher
intensity training for athletes already fatigued. The
thinking is that this approach provides a greater stim-
ulus for adaptation. Later on, when the emphasis is on
competition-specific speed, it is usually better to un-
dertake high-intensity training in a fresh condition in
order to facilitate higher speeds.

Training plan for a season

The contemporary model of preparing competitive
swimmers in a given year is based on the following se-
quence of training and competition: preseason, early
season, competitive season, taper, championship sea-
son, and recovery or off-season. For highly trained
swimmers the competitive season usually takes the
form of domestic competition or international com-
petitions like the FINA World Cup Series. The champi-
onship season typically involves the national champi-
onships, often doubling as the national team selection
trials, and then the major international competition
for that particular year.

Once the competition schedule has been estab-
lished, the training plan can be prepared with the goal
of maximizing the performance of the swimmer for
the competitive and championship seasons. For in-
ternational swimmers, the entire season is typically
44-48 weeks in length with a short break permit-
ted after completion of the championship season.
The length of each of the different training phases
will vary according to the individual circumstances
of the swimmer, team, and coach. In recent years,
the international swimming calendar has become
more crowded and as a consequence the annual train-
ing plan has become more fragmented and com-
plex. A common view of experienced coaches is that
this trend has been beneficial for sprint swimming,
but detrimental to distance swimming. The relative
plateauing of world recordsin women’s distance swim-
ming provides some support for this view.

The evolution of the modern training plan can be
viewed from three perspectives. The traditional ap-
proach to the annual plan and individual training
sessions has centered on the different energy sys-
tems as they apply to competitive swimming. The

that need to be considered. To address some of these

of each individual event (Mason 1999),

Prescription of training speeds

Training by competitive swimmers typically consists
of repeated bouts of shorter or longer intervals in a
short-course or long-course pool. Intervals span acon-
tinuum from longer slower intervals (50-1600 m for
developing aerobic or endurance fitness) to shorter
faster intervals (15-200 m for developing anaerobic
or race pace qualities). The basic prescription of in-
terval training can be simplified to four primary vari-
ables: (i) the number of intervals or repeat efforts,
(ii) the length/distance of the interval (15 m to con-
tinuous swimming), (iii) the intensity (i.e., pace or
velocity) of the interval, and (iv) the rest period be-
_ tween intervals (variously formulated as the cycle time
or rest period). The resulting training sets can be pre-
sented in the well established format of number of

and 16 x 50 m (@ 200 m race pace) on 1:30.

A fundamental! challenge for coaches and scien-
tists is the accurate determination of specific training
paces. A common approach is to base training times
on the goal or predicted competition time for each
individual swimmer. At the international! level, this
is achieved by examination of the most recent cham-
pionship performances and where necessary forward
projection to the upcoming major competition. To il-
lustrate this process, the winning time for each gold
medalist in the freestyle and form stroke events at the
Sydney 2000 Olympic Games is shown in Table 8.1. It
is interesting to note differences in performance time
between distances (in the freestyle events), between
events (in the form strokes), and between male and
female swimmers. The average pace per 100 m pro-
vides a mean of comparing the pace of different events
in a format commonly used by coaches. The percent-
age difference in average pace from the 50 m to the
1500-m freestyle at the 2000 Olympic Games was ap-
proximately 27%. This variation in pace provides a
substantial challenge for coaches with large training
squads comprising swimmers of different sexes, levels,
strokes, and distances.

Preseason training commences from the low base of
fitness maintained during the off-season. Swimmers
typically start the preseason phase with a single ses-
sion per day and gradually increase the number of ses-
sions over the first few weeks. A graded increase sees

the frequency of training increasing from one session
per day, to three sessions over 2 days, and eventually
to the traditional two sessions per day format followed
by the majority of high-level swimmers. The intensity
of swimming is low to moderate to facilitate structural
improvements leading toward improved cardiorespi-
ratory fitness. Slower swimming also permits the ac-
quisition and development of skills at lower speeds,
before transfer to faster competitive speeds. A limited
amount of shorter faster work is recommended, even
from the first week of the season, to develop and main-
tain neuromuscular patterns. This approach prepares
the swimmer for the more intensive training that
follows in the early-season and competitive-season
phases.

Early season

The main features of the early-season phase are a mod-
est training volume to start, small 5-10 km increases
in volume per week, low initial training intensity, and
dry-land conditioning including flexibility, circuits,
weight training, and other games and activities, to im-
prove the overall sport abilities of the swimmer. Af-
ter several weeks there are further increases in train-
ing volume, a gradual introduction of higher intensity
aerobic work to the level of the lactate threshold, and
emphasis on skill and technique development before
moving to the faster training speeds. In simple terms,
training volume elicits improvements in general en-
durance fitness while training intensity develops the
specific fitness required for racing and competitive suc-
cess. The later weeks of the early-season phase focus
on continuing development of the lactate threshold
(endurance fitness), maximal oxygen uptake (maxi-
mal aerobic) and race pace training capacities, ongo-
ing manipulation of training volume and intensity to
maintain improvement, an individualized approach
to volume, intensity and recovery, and refinement of
skills particularly at race speeds.

The early-season phase is based on sequential in-
creases in the volume and intensity of training. The
prescription of swimming training in its simplest form
is achieved by manipulation of these two factors.
Training volume in swimming is relatively easy to
quantify, and forms the basis of most modern swim-
ming programs. Multiples of laps are easily added to
determine the total distance covered in a single set,

session, or training week. Most coaches and swimmers
are comfortable with the notion and terminology re-
lating, for example, to a 2000-m set (e.g. 20 x 100 m),
a 6000-m session or a 40-km week. High-level training
involving planning for the longer period (e.g., the an-
nual plan or even the 4 year Olympic quadrennium)
necessitates the calculation of long-term training
volumes. For example, coaches can plan for a 2-week
training camp (e.g., 140 km in a 14-day camp), a
complete preparation or training macrocycle (e.g.,
500 km fora 12-week cycle), ora full training year (e.g.,
2000 km in 46 weeks). Although these calculations can
be time consuming they are useful in the planning and
review of coaching programs.

A central issue in planning relates to the relative
potency (and paradoxically, the relative danger) of
substantial increases in training volume and inten-
sity. Although high training volumes, and periodic
doses of high-intensity training, are a fundamental
part of training, the problems associated with exces-
sive training, particularly when coupled with inade-
quate recovery, are known to all coaches. Coaching
experience and the results of scientific research collec-
tively suggest that excessive training volume and train-
ing intensity can induce fatigue, overtraining, injury,
or illness. Coaches are aware that distance swimmers
generally require higher training volumes (approxi-
mately 20-25% more than sprint swimmers) to de-
velop the background necessary for success in events
ranging from the 400 to 1500 m. In practice, sub-
stantial increases in either training volume or inten-
sity during the early season places considerable phys-
ical demands and stress on the body. Some swimmers
exhibit fatigue and poor performance when training
loads are excessively high and recovery is incomplete,
although this state is largely reversible with a few days
rest.

In contrast to training volume, training intensity is
more difficult to quantify. A systematic approach is re-
quired for effective planning and monitoring of train-
ing intensity. The most common approach involves
the use of a training classification system that gives
rise to different training intensities. In the past the
majority of these training systems have relied on rel-
atively subjective descriptors of intensity. This prac-
tice has given rise to a wide range of terminology
(e.g., moderate intensity aerobic, aerobic threshold,

lactate accumulation, maximal alactic anaerobic) that
is difficult to distinguish in practice (Counsilman &
Counsilman 1993). To. overcome the problems of ter-
minology and to provide a more quantitative basis,
scientists have devised various systems where differ-
ent intensities of swimming are ascribed a particular
“weighting or physiological stress coefficient” (Mujika
et al. 1996). This process is based on the blood lactate
concentration that presumably reflects the physiolog-
ical demand of different exercise intensities.

To illustrate this approach, the training classifica-
tion system devised for swimmers at the Australian In-
stitute of Sport is shown in Table 8.2. The most impor-
tant feature is that the degree of physiological stress
experienced by the swimmer increases exponentially
above the level of the lactate threshold. Proportionally
greater weighting coefficients are given to the higher
training intensity levels. Low- and moderate-intensity
aerobic efforts have the lowest weighting coefficients,
while the more intensive maximal aerobic training
is given a proportionally higher coefficient. Sprint
training (which can be the most physiologically
demanding) is given the highest coefficient. Other
modeling systems employ a similar system of weight-
ing coefficients. This type of approach to monitoring
training intensity has given rise to the development
of additional descriptors of training such as training
load (the product of training volume and training in-
tensity), training monotony, and training strain (the
product of training load and monotony) (Foster 1998).

Tapering

The tapering strategy used by many swimmers to opti-
mize competition performance has been defined as
“a progressive non-linear reduction of the training
load during a variable period of time, in an attempt

to reduce the physiological and psychological stress
of daily training and optimize sports performance”
(Mujika & Padilla 2000). The aim of the taper be-
fore the main competitions of the season is to elicit
substantial improvements in performance. These per-
formance gains have been variously attributed to in-
creased levels of muscular force and power (Trappe
et al. 2000), and improvements in neuromuscular,
hematological, and hormonal function, and/or the
psychological status of the swimmer (Mujika & Padilla
2000). The main features of the taper include a sys-
tematic 3-4 week reduction in training volume, on-
going aerobic work to maintain basic fitness and de-
velop race fitness, and fine tuning of race pace and
pacing strategies through use of descending sets, bro-
ken swims, and time trials. Training volume is gradu-
ally reduced reaching about 20% of the peak weekly
mileage at the time of competition. The conventional
wisdom in the swimming community holds that male
and sprint swimmers generally require a longer taper
than female and distance swimmers respectively.

A study of the taper of swimmers competing at the
2000 Olympic Games revealed a mean performance
improvement of 2.2 + 1.5% (range —1.1 to 6.0%) over
the final 3 weeks of training (Mujika etal. 2002). A total
of 91 out of the 99 analyzed performances were faster
at the Olympic Games after the taper and only 8 were
slower. The percentage improvement in performance
time was greater in the males (2.6 + 1.5%) (mean +
standard deviation) than the females (1.8 + 1.5%).
The improvement of ~2% in performance with the
taper similar for all Olympic events and was achieved
by swimmers from different countries and perfor-
mance levels. This information provides a quantitative
framework for coaches and swimmers to set realistic
performance goals based on individual performance
levels.

Championship season

The championship season is all about competitive per-
formance rather than responses to training. Estimates
of progression and variability of performance in com-
petitions are useful for coaches, swimmers, and re-
searchers interested in factors affecting performance
(Hopkins et al. 1999; Trewin et al. 2004). Progressions
are generally required to ensure that a swimmer qual-
ifies for the semifinal and then the final in a given
event, and that peak performance is produced in the
final, where medals are decided. Performance evalua-
tions of this type for leading swimmers provide some
insight into the variability and progression of perfor-
mance of both individuals and teams (Stewart & Hop-
kins 2000). This information also assists swimmers
and coaches in the planning process.

The utility of these estimates was examined in swim-
mers of the world’s top two swimming nations com-
peting in the 2000 Olympic Games (Pyne ef al. in
press). Official race times (n= 676) of 26 US and
25 Australian Olympic swimmers who competed
in the 1999 Pan Pacific Championships, the 2000
Olympic Trials, and the 2000 Olympic Games were
analyzed. Within each competition, both nations
showed similar improvements of 1.2% in mean perfor-
mance time from heats through finals. Mean compe-
tition time improved in the 12 months between the
Pan Pacifics and Olympics by approximately 0.9%.
The typical variation in performance time for a swim-
mer between races was 0.6% within a competition
and 0.8% between competitions. Sex and swimming
distance appeared to have minor or negligible ef-
fects on progression and variability. These findings
suggest that an Olympic swimmer has to improve per-
formance by ~1% within a competition to stay in con-
tention for a medal and by ~1% within the year lead-
ing to the Olympics.

The variation in performance from race to race is
an important determinant of a swimmer’s chances
of winning the race. A swimmer in contention for a
medal has to improve his or her performance by ap-
proximately half the typical race-to-race variation in
performance (expressed as a standard deviation) to
substantially increase their chance of success. How-
ever, other swimmers may also improve their per-
formance between competitions, so a given swim-
mer will need to improve by an additional amount
approximately equal to the mean progression of all

Recovery or off-season

The main features of this phase are maintaining an
active approach with at least three low- to moderate-
intensity aerobic swims completed each week, special-
ized programs to target weaknesses in individual fit-
ness profiles, and dietary control to maintain body
composition. There are few studies that have directly
addressed the issue of the most effective program for
swimmers to follow during the off-season or in short
breaks from training and competition. There is, how-
ever, a significant body of literature that details the
time course of training adaptations with training and
loss of fitness during detraining (Counsilman & Coun-
silman 1991; Mujika & Padilla 2000). A typical strategy
for the off-season involves a marked 50-70% reduction
in the frequency, volume, and intensity of training.

Periodizing to build endurance and
speed—An example

The following is an example of the features of peri-
odization that may encompassa typical 14-week swim-
ming preparation fora national championships or ma-
jor international meet.

Macrocycle 1: aerobic (weeks 1-4)

Asin most training programs the initial phase involves
the development or reestablishment of endurance
fitness. This serves as the basis for the subsequent de-
velopment of aerobic and anaerobic capacities and the
functional utilization of these capacities. Functional
utilization refers to increased swimming speed at a
given metabolic load. Apart from the underlying phys-
iological adaptations, improved endurance will lead
to an increased ability to cope with fatigue and more
rapid recovery from the stresses of speed training and
competition. In particular, the aim is to develop the
capacity and efficiency of the cardiorespiratory sys-
tem. This process is largely achieved by high volume-
low intensity training. Other adaptations include

increased utilization of fat as a fuel source, stronger
ligaments, tendons and connective tissue, adapta-
tions within slow-twitch muscle fibers, and improved
neuromuscular control. The length of this phase will
depend on several factors (e.g., fitness level of ath-
letes, time available, objectives of mesocycle) but is
normally between 3-4 weeks.

Macrocycle 2: aerobic/anaerobic
{weeks 5-8)

In this macrocycle, the other primary components of
aerobic training are developed. Assuming that low to
moderate intensity endurance work is developed in
the first microcycle, this cycle is characterized by an
emphasis on lactate threshold training. For example,
the 200 m swimmers undertake up to 30% of work in
this cycle at the level of lactate threshold, and up to
15% of maximal oxygen uptake and lactate tolerance
work. Some coaches may think these levels are too low
for middle-distance and sprint athletes (the levels will
vary for different sports and events). The total train-
ing volume is increased over macrocycle 1 and there
is a progressive introduction of shorter and faster in-
tervals. The duration of the macrocycle is normally
2-3 weeks.

Macrocycle 3: transition (weeks 9-12)

In many ways this is the key training phase. The aim
is to develop the functional utilization of the energy
systems and capacities that were established in the aer-
obic endurance and aerobic/anaerobic macrocycles. It
is well documented that the factor that correlates most

often overlooked. To illustrate this point consider the
following example: Swimmer Ais likely to perform bet-
ter if his or her speed is faster than swimmer B at the

competitive speeds. The high degree of aerobic fitness
developed earlier will be maintained even though the
emphasis of training is on higher quality intervals.
This macrocycle is fairly short with an average length
of 3-4 weeks.

Macrocycle 4: taper and
competition (weeks 12-14)

The final macrocycle within the season (mesocycle)
involves the taper period and the competition phase.
Again the logic follows the preceding macrocycle and
training is characterized by a further reduction in
training volume, and the development of speed and
power. In swimming, it is common to reduce the train-
ing volume by approximately half (50%) to two thirds
(67%) of the peak weekly volume for the preparation.
The key is to reduce the volume and sharpen the speed.
This process involves shorter intervals at faster than
race pace, e.g., for 100-m swimmers there would be
an emphasis on 25 and 50-m intervals at faster than
100 m race pace. It is important to maintain some aero-
bic training in this macrocycle and a common mistake
is to reduce training mileage too rapidly. Aerobic work
is needed to support the taper and forms an essential
part of the recovery and regeneration process prior to
competition.

Coaching tips, by Wayne M. Goldsmith

1 The most important consideration is that peaking for perfor-
mance is an active process. Put as much effort into the planning
and execution of the tapering and peaking program as you do for
regular training.

2 The annual plan and the competition calendar are essential
tools. To achieve extraordinary results you need an extraordinar-
ily good training program. Last year’s program may bring you last
year's results.

3 Make sure your athletes are able to train at close to race speed
when required. This is achieved by careful management of en-
durance, speed, and recovery.

4 Plan broad details for a mesocycle, fine details for a microcycle,
and adjust details on a daily basis.

5 Although the requirement for aerobic work applies to the middle
distance and distance events, even the shorter sprint events may
benefit from this type of training.

6 Amore effective approach is to have a broad-based condition-
ing program. Too much concentration in one area, e.g., weight
training, and neglect of others, e.g., flexibility or cross training,
may be a limiting factor.

7 Be proactive: make and dictate the move from volume to in-
tensity, endurance to speed, and training to racing.

8 When peaking, the development of race speed should take
priority over conditioning work.

9 Control the intensity of training by speed (pacing), heart rate,
and perception of effort (by the athlete and coach) —don't neglect
any one factor.

10 Use speed-assisted drills: speed-assist device (stretch cords)
or pace work with similar or faster athletes.

11 The key of peaking is to reduce volume and sharpen speed.
Peaking is an active process of training, achieved by a well-
planned, well-executed training and recovery program.

Sequential loading of
training microcycles

This section addresses some of ways to plan a short
training microcycle for competitive swimmers. A cre-
ative approach to the planning of training sessions is
essential to maintain an adequate adaptation stimu-
lus. Once the various cycles are organized within the
season or yearly plan, the detailing of individual train-
ing sessions can begin.

Some coaches make the mistake of not properly in-
tegrating speed and endurance in the training pro-
gram. This is particularly evident in the endurance
phase where too great an emphasis on the volume of
training may impair speed. It is an oversimplification
to think that only low to moderate intensity volume
work is undertaken in an “endurance” week or phase,
and that only speed work is done in a “speed” week. If
insufficient speed work is undertaken during the en-
durance phase, a swimmer may pay the price later on
when they are unable to reproduce race or competi-
tive speeds. Conversely, swimmers may become over-
loaded and prone to fatigue, illness, and injury if they
do too much speed work without the benefits of some
complementary endurance training. Highly trained
swimmers can use endurance training to recover from
and prepare for speed training.

Three-day microcycle example

What are some approaches to loading microcycles in
swimming? One method used by the Swimming Pro-
gram at the Australian Institute of Sport is to systemat-
ically increase the intensity of workouts during a 3-day
microcycle. The example described here is taken from
a relatively intense microcycle used to target specific
areas of aerobic fitness in highly trained swimmers
(Table 8.4). The basic variables of interval training
(e.g., intensity, volume, duration, and frequency) are
manipulated to meet the goals of each individual
session and microcycle. This microcycle is for senior
swimmers in good condition and may not be appro-
priate for age group swimmers or those returning from
a layoff, injury, or illness.

Inspection of this sequence shows that the speed of
training is increased systematically within each day
and also across successive days (Table 8.4). Training
three sessions a day is a big commitment but the ben-
efits gained can be substantial. Apart from having the
opportunity to undertake a larger volume of train-
ing, there is scope to incorporate all the important
elements of training. This may simply involve work-
ing all the different strokes, drills, and sets. It also
gives the opportunity for some creative coaching, like
switching sets for individual medley, combination sets
of varying distances and intensities, and trying out
some new technique drills. One of the main benefits
of three sessions a day is to improve the swimmer’s
feel of the water with more frequent exposure than is
normally experienced. Three sessions a day is not new

and has been used occasionally by leading coaches and
swimmers.

Day 1

On Day 1, aerobic intervals and some short sprints
are undertaken for a total volume of 14.5 km (5.0 +
6.0 + 3.5). The AM session contains some 400s at an
aerobic level. This work forms the basis of a highly
trained swimmer’s program, but some swimmers shy
away from this type of work. Even sprinters should
be prepared to undertake some basic endurance work.
The main set of the Noon session is 8 x (200 0n 2:45 [1],
100 on 1:40 [2]). (Numbers in square brackets represent
intensity ratings; see Table 8.4 for description of intensity
ratings.) These cycles are for freestyle and would need
to be adjusted for the form strokes. Most coaches use
the approach seen here of 200s at an aerobic speed
and then 100s at a slightly faster threshold speed. The
shorter session in the PM contains the speed work (4 x
2 x 25 m at [5]). Again the emphasis is on increasing
speed as the set progresses. Swimmers should always
be able to perform fast 25s even during high volume
training weeks.

Day 2

On Day 2 the same training volume as on Day 1
(14.5 km) is completed but there is more quality in
the Noon session. The AM session is used to prepare
the swimmers for higher quality swimming in the
Noon and PM sessions. The AM session has some 800s
and 1000s. These are often but not always done

The Noon session of 6 x (150 on 2:15 at [1], 150 on
2:15 at [2], 100 on 2:30 at [3]) is a useful way to intro-
duce more quality and speed into the workouts. This

on a longer cycle time (2:30) to permit some recov-
ery before the set is repeated. This is an example of
a combination set that mixes different distances and
different intensities. The total distance of the set is
2400 m, which represents a solid training session for
aerobic fitness. This type of work can be used in con-
junction with the commonly used “heart rate” sets,
which are characterized by the repetition of the same
distance at equivalent or increasing intensity, e.g.,
30 x 100 m on 1:40 holding 1:05 or heart rate 160—
190 bpm (40-10 beats below a maximum heart rate of
200 bpm). A commonly asked question by coaches is
whether it is better to hold swimmers at a high heart
rate and let their repeat times slip a little, or back them
off to keep their heart rate under control. The most
important thing is to maintain speed together with
proper technique—if this means increasing the rest
period or cycle time, or slowing the swimmer a little.
There is no single answer here and a coach has to ex-
ercise his or her judgment as to the most appropriate
action on the day.

Day 3

On Day 3, there are only two sessions for a total of
9 km. This gives the swimmers a better opportunity
to attack the main Noon session. The aim here is to
reduce the volume of training and concentrate on the

speed (intensity). Note again how the AM session con-
tains a small build-up of intensity [1-2] to prepare the
swimmers for the demanding [2-3-4] Noon session.
Contrast this to the AM sessionsin Days 1 and 2 where
only aerobic [1] work was undertaken. Using the first
session to prepare a swimmer for the second session
is possible where the sessions are close together and
only a few hours apart.

The final Noon session of this 3-day microcycle is
4 x (2 x 100 on 1:40 [2], 2 x 100 on 2:30 [3], and 2 x
50o0n 1:00 [4]). This is the most intensive session of the
microcycle both in terms of effort and speed. Note that
the second pair of 2 x 100 is on a longer cycle (2:30)
than the first pair (1:40). The extra time is designed to
support the increase in speed, i.e., 2 x 100 on 2:30 at
[3] compared with 2 x 100 on 1:40 at [2]. It is expected
that the 50s would be quite fast, at around 100 m race
pace. Again these cycles are for freestyle and may need
to be adjusted for other strokes or junior swimmers.

Summary

This is an example of “loading volume first, then qual-
ity” within a 3-day microcycle. While most coaches
are familiar with planning interval training workouts,
the fundamental step involves integrating a whole se-
quence of interval sessions that contribute to the spe-
cific goals for that training cycle. The example pre-
sented here was a 3-day training cycle with a total of
36 km. Senior swimmers have used this type of train-
ing in high volume camps, at altitude, and in various
stages of the training cycle, where the coach is look-
ing to develop the level of aerobic fitness. Even age-
group swimmers could undertake a modified version
of this three sessions a day training plan during orga-
nized camps or the school holiday period. The princi-
ples and workouts discussed here are, of course, equally
relevant to the more routine practice of two sessions a

Pool-based testing

The traditional approach to the physiological as-
sessment of competitive swimmers has centered on
pool-based testing of aerobic or endurance fitness.
These tests have generally used protocols involving a
progressive incremental series of swims culminating
in a maximal effort. Pioneering work in the metabolic
assessment (oxygen uptake) of swimmers conducted
in the 1970s and 1980s paved the way for a more rigor-
ous approach to training based on physiological and
metabolic parameters (Troup 1999). Logistical diffi-
culties associated with collection of expired ventila-
tion, and concerns over the validity of measurement
techniques such as backward extrapolation (Sleivert &
Mackinnon 1991), have focused attention on indirect
measures of energy cost such as heart rate and blood
lactate.

Observational monitoring of heart rate and blood

lactate analyzers in the 1980s and 1990s generated
considerable interest in the swimming community
(Prins 1988). A key consideration with heart rate and
blood lactate testing is that physiological responses
should be interpreted in the context of performance
times. From a coaching perspective, the quality of a
particular training set is determined by inspection of
the mean time for each set of intervals, the fastest time,
range of times, split times, and comparison with the
respective goal or target times for the set, as well the
physiological measures of heart rate and lactate. Seif-
reported measures of psychophysiological status such
as the Borg Scale (RPE, rating of perceived exertion) are
useful in monitoring the feedback of swimmers dur-
ing prolonged and/or intensive training sets. In com-
bination with physiological measures, such as blood
lactate concentration, the rating of perceived exertion
is a useful indicator of the presence of fatigue (Snyder
et al. 1993),

Assessment of sprint capabilities requires testing
protocols with shorter, faster intervals of 25, 50, or
100 m. Performance time and stroke mechanics (e.g.,
stroke rate, stroke length, stroke count) are mea-
sured. In this context, these characteristics are more
important than the traditional physiological indica-
tors of heart rate and blood lactate concentration.
Swimming velocity is the product of stroke length
(m/stroke) and stroke frequency (stroke rate), while
the derived index of stroke efficiency is calculated as
the product of stroke length (m) and swimming veloc-
ity (m-s~'). The stroke characteristics are plotted as a
linear or polynomial function of swimming velocity
(Pyne et al. 2000). Many coaches simply use a timed
dive 25 m maximal effort swim to indicate the progress
in developing race speed for the sprint events.

Body composition

The development and maintenance of lean body mass
is an important factor in swimming where character-
istics of endurance, power, and strength are associated
with performance. The most common method for the
assessment of body composition in elite swimmers is
measurement of skinfold thickness. Despite the rela-
tive ease of simple body composition measurements,
there are very few published reports on seasonal and
long-term changes in competitive swimmers. There is
only limited information on morphological changes

adipose tissue (Hawes & Sovak 1994). A study of 15 elite
female swimmers monitored at three points during a
competitive season reported major changes during the
early part of the season, with no further changes oc-
curring during the second half of the season (Meleski
& Malina 1985). There were significant losses in body
fat but gains in lean body mass with training. Both of
these studies produced results that are in line with the
expectation ofimproved body composition aftera suc-
cessful training program. More detailed information
on systematic changes in body composition through
each phase of training in a given preparation, and
over an athlete’s career, would be a great assistance
for coaches and practitioners.

Performance analysis

Performance analysis represents a new approach in
swimming that links directly the results of physi-
ological and biomechanical testing with the com-
petitive performance of individual swimmers. Perfor-
mance analysis can be categorized into two areas:
(i) overall performance analysis and (ii) competitive
or race modeling. Performance analysis involves mon-
itoring the overall progression of total race times
within and between competitions (Table 8.3). Pro-
gressions are generally required within a single com-
petition to ensure that a swimmer qualifies for the
semifinal and final. In the same way, progressions
in training times, either in routine training sets re-
peated on a regular basis through the season or
with standardized physiological testing, will indicate
the degree of improvement or progress with train-
ing. Race modeling involves filming of swimming
races and measurement of a range of performance
and stroke characteristics including start time, turn

times, split times, stroke rate, stroke length, stroke
efficiency, and finish time (Mason 1999). This infor-
mation ona given swimmer can be compared with pre-
vious races (individual comparison), with other swim-
mers in the same race (group comparison), or against
benchmarks such as the world record in that event
(Table 8.5). Most of the major international champi-
onships since the mid 1990s have provided this infor-
mation for coaches and swimmers (Table 8.6).

Competition analysis, by Wayne M. Goldsmith

Over the past 10 years, the factors that contribute to swimming
successfully at top national and international competitions have
been analyzed by leading sports scientists such as Dr Bruce
Mason of the Australian Institute of Sport. Competition analysis
breaks down racing into its various components.

* Start time: The first 15 m (from the starting signal to the time
the swimmer'’s head crosses the 15-m mark from the starting
wall).

* Jurn time: A distance of 7.5 min and out of the wall (laken
from the point where the swimmer's head passes through a point
7.5 m from the wall into a turn and continues until the swimmer's
head passes through the same point 7.5 m from the wall on the
way out of the turn).

* Finish time: The final 5 m (from the time the swimmer's head
passes the 5 m mark from the finish wall to the actual hand touch
on the wall).

* Stroke length: The distance the swimmer's head moves during
a complete arm cycle (i.e., from right-hand entry to the next right-
hand entry).

* Stroke rate (or stroke frequency): The number of stroke cycles
per minute.

* Swimming speed (or velocity)

* Split times (each 25/50 m segment of the race)

Interpretation

Interpretation of physiological testing with individual
swimmers should account for a wide range of factors
that can influence results. The most obvious of these
factors are age (chronological age), gender (male or
female), and characteristics of the underlying event in-
cluding distance (sprint, middle-distance, or distance)
and stroke (freestyle, form stroke, or individual med-
ley). The immediate (previous weeks to months) and
long-term (years of training and competitive experi-
ence) training history of the swimmer should also be
considered. Testing during the competitive and cham-
pionships seasons is likely to see the swimmer in a

Future directions

The physiological testing of elite swimmers has
evolved greatly over the last half century, and at the
start of the new millennium it appears that the rate of
progress will be maintained. The 1960s and 1970s was
the era of whole body physiological and cardiorespira-
tory testing of athletes (Baldwin 2000). In swimming
this was characterized by measurement of parameters
such as heart rate, lung function, body temperature,
and aerobic capacity. The 1980s and 1990s was seen
as the era of cellular biochemistry with emphasis on
hematological and biochemical testing. The most vis-
ible manifestation of this era was the introduction
of blood lactate testing in the preparation of highly
trained swimmers (Madsen & Lohberg 1987). At the
dawn of the twenty-first century, genetic modeling of
physiological factors that affect sport performance is
a very active field of scientific endeavor. A number
of genes have already been identified that identify
the genetic predisposition of athletes for endurance
(angiotensin converting enzyme (Myerson 1999)) and
sprint (@-actinin3 (North 1999)) activities. Despite the
rapid pace of developments in science, medicine, and
technology, the testing of swimmers will continue
to reflect a balance between research outcomes and
the hard-earned practical experience of swimmers and
coaches.

Handbook of
Sports Medicine
and Science
Swimming

Swimming is a further volume in the Handbook

of Sports Medicine and Science Series, published
under the auspices of the International Olympic
Committee, and focuses on interpreting current
knowledge in the subject.

This second edition updates the highly successful
first edition edited by Costill, Maglischo and
Richardson which was published in the early 1990s.
The intention of the new editors is to interpret current
sports science knowledge as it specifically pertains
to coaching swimmers at club, county or national
level. The handbook is not intended to be a
scientist-to-scientist textbook, but rather a scientist-
to-physician/coach/trainer/athlete/parent handbook.

The up-to-date information about the medicine
and science of Swimming is presented in a clear and
readable style designed to be directly practical.
