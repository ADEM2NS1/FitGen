FFFFOOOORRRREEEEWWWWOOOORRRRDDDD
When I was growing up in competitive swimming in the late 1960s
and early 70s, my heroes included the fastest swimmers of the time,
not so much for their strength and power, but more for their
tremendous dedication to perfecting their skill. Those swimmers
knew how to move through the water! I studied their swimming and
came to the conclusion that what made them great was their ability
to understand of how swimming works, to focus on what needed to
be done, and to put it all together in competition. Like me, those
swimmers loved to swim, and they loved to swim well. Now, three
decades later, as a swim coach, I still look at these qualities with
awe when I observe them in a swimmer. They were immediately
apparent in Conny.
When she found our swim team, she was struggling to adjust to life
in the United States. Although she was comfortable with the English
language, it was clear she was uncomfortable with her new
surroundings. She looked worried and thin when I met her. In our
initial conversation, I learned that swimming had been a big part of
her life in Germany. As she looked longingly at the pool, I felt
that she was truly a fish out of water. When I invited her to get in,
her eyes twinkled, and she dove in without hardly interrupting
the water. I knew then that, whether in Berlin or Berkeley, the water
was her home.
Her swimming was relaxed yet powerful. She had versatility, polish,
and she had speed! Above all, it was clear that she loved to swim
and to do it well. She took great pleasure in the process of doing
the workout. She did each set with purpose. As she swam, I saw
clearly the qualities I admired in the great swimmers of my youth.
Conny swam with heart. As I watched her, the hair on my arms stood
on end!
It wasn’t until later that I learned that she was both European and
World Champion in several events. She was, and still is, truly one of
the best female Masters swimmers in the world. Now after several
years with our team, I can only say what a pleasure it has been to be
involved in the swimming of such an athlete. She brings an enviable
commitment to the sport, and a real appreciation for our program.

Foreword
As a swimmer and as a person, she has become a part of the family
of our team.
Of the many highlights of my coaching career, one of the most
memorable experiences happened at the Short Course Nationals of
2003, under the blazing sun of Arizona. It was a great meet for our
whole team, with many best times and medals. Conny was in peak
physical condition and, looking like an athlete half her age, started
out the meet by winning the 400 I.M., coming from behind in Lane 8
to the cheers of her teammates and me. She followed up that
performance with a victory in the 200 breaststroke, leading the field
solidly after the first 100, and never letting go. Shortly before her
final event, the 200 I.M., as I was wilting in the relentless
temperature of the final day of the meet, Conny turned to me and
said, “You know, the heat is another competitor.” This statement
said it all to me. I knew then that she was going to swim the race of
her lifetime. Sure enough, she approached the block with an
intensity I had never seen. In the fastest heat, I watched her take on
the eight length race with focus, understanding, and heart. I watched
her reach inside and put it all together in an unforgettable swimming
performance that was not only her best, but the best. After the meet,
as I was still glowing from the successes of the swimmers on our
team, Conny amazed me once more. She said thank you to me for
her swimming.
It is with the utmost respect that I have worked on this book project
with Conny. Our relationship over the past several years has enriched
me as a person and inspired me as a swimming coach. It is my hope
that swimmers and coaches who read this book will find their
experience with Masters swimming to be equally meaningful.

Foreword
When I met Coach Blythe for the first time at workout she was late.
Another swimmer took me by the hand saying that she would come
soon and just to warm up a bit. That was at an outdoor pool in
Berkeley, California in November 2002. I had just moved to the
United States. I was already an experienced and successful Masters
swimmer in Germany. In fact, I had been on a swim team since I was
a child, but never one dedicated only to Masters, with its own coach.
Some swimmers were warming up and some others introduced
themselves to me. They ranged in age from 20 to 65, I guessed, and
were all very kind. Then she came. An ageless-looking women with
immensely long blond hair stepped confidently through the door to
the pool deck greeting everybody by asking them if they’d already
warmed up. “We have a new good swimmer here for our team,“ the
girl who had guided me through the locker rooms announced,
although I was still dry, standing on the deck. Blythe introduced
herself to me and we talked a bit about my former swimming career,
but she could see how eager I was to get in the pool.
It was one of the nicest and most pleasurable workouts I had ever
swum and, after more than 32 years of swimming, you can guess
how many workouts I have done. Not only was it that the pool was
unexpectedly warm and the California air so refreshing, it was that
every minute, every yard, every set of the training was a pleasure.
And it has been like this for me ever since.
But why? Why is swimming with this Masters team so different?
Because of her! It didn’t take long to find out why Blythe makes your
day into a good one with every workout she provides. She just has
the right feeling for everything concerning swimming. And I don’t just
mean her diversified workout plans, or that she is always on deck
with the swimmers. No, it is the warmness, the humanness, the love
with which she approaches so many different characters on the
team, with so many different histories (in swimming and in private
life) and such different expectations regarding swimming. She has all
this and, together with her immense knowledge and experience of
swimming, she gives it so generously and unselfishly to everybody
10

Foreword
who comes to swim. She doesn’t want anything back and is just
content seeing everybody swimming their laps fast or slow, improving
technique and conditioning and leaving the pool pleasantly fatigued
and satisfied. She has a word and an ear for everybody, no matter if
it is about swimming or something else. She is the reason people
find their way back to the pool and swim even if they are pregnant,
have kids and family duties, were seriously ill, divorced or have been
going though other problems. Afterwards, they feel better and are
able to face their situations with more confidence.
This is the magic of Blythe’s coaching, and that’s why we have such
a nice team whose members can swim together at the same time in
the same pool despite being age 20 to 70 and older, coming from
very different nationalities, or swimming on different levels. We may
not be the largest team, or the one with the most record holders,
but we have the best team.
It is a gift to have such a coach, even though I am not 16 anymore or
on a college scholarship. I’m very grateful for this. It is also an honor
for me to have worked on this book with Blythe. I hope and wish
that everyone who reads this book will get the most benefit out of
our work and partnership, not only in terms of swimming.
Keep swimming, Masters swimmers! Keep coaching, Masters coaches!

a new team and the many issues involved in operating it
successfully. The unique aspects of coaching adult swimmers and
swim teams are also addressed.
In the final chapter, subjects include motivation and establishing a
swimming routine. The thought process of swimmers as they move
from one level to the next is described. Measuring progress is
discussed in terms of physical improvements, goal setting and
challenges in both competition and workout. Sticking with it,
through the initial stages of swimming, is identified as a swimmer’s
biggest challenge.
LINK Throughout this book, a system of links in the margin has been
included to make it easy for the reader to cross-reference information
found elsewhere in the text. As so many swimming issues are
interrelated, we thought this was an important element to add.
It has been our goal to create a user-friendly book, which makes
Masters swimming approachable to all adults interested in
improving, regaining and maintaining fitness. We hope you enjoy our
book, and we hope you use it to build a lasting relationship with
Masters swimming.
Finally, we want to acknowledge the many supporters of this project,
including our families who believed in us; Vince who read each
chapter-in-progress late into the night; Meredith and Jessica who
edited with great care and skill; Steve and Kurt for their expert
photography; Tami for being such a team player, and all the talented
swimmers of Berkeley Aquatic Masters whose images grace the
pages of this book.

Why Masters Swimming?
1.1
ADULT FITNESS
Over the past few decades, the worldwide movement toward adult
fitness reflects the growing sentiment that staying fit is not
something that has to end with childhood. Until recently, it was only
the elite athlete who was afforded the social acceptance to continue
an athletic lifestyle into his or her adult years. And still, with a few
exceptions, professional ball players, cyclists, weightlifters, runners
and swimmers retired long before they were “middle aged.” But the
recent rise of adult fitness programs and associations, such as
Masters swimming, have created not only more opportunities for
adults to be physically fit, but have helped change the way society
looks at adult fitness. Until very recently, adults who continued to
pursue fitness with more than a casual interest were seen as aging
people refusing to let go of their youth, unable to accept “growing
again gracefully.” Slowly, but surely, this attitude is changing.
It is more common to hear of adults involved in physical fitness
described with esteem rather than ridicule, and more and more
credence is given to the saying “you are only as old as you feel.”
Physically fit adults in their 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s and beyond are
now called “adult athletes” by the evolved bystander, as they
continue to defy athletic barriers.
Still, participating in a fitness routine as an adult takes some
personal initiative and persistence. Masters swimming has become
one of the most widespread adult fitness activities, with an
international network of places to swim and events, making it both
accessible and popular. But, beyond the issues of logistics and
social acceptance, there are several hurdles that must be overcome
to make fitness as an adult a true lifestyle.

HURDLE #1
Other Priorities
In adulthood, career and family take center stage. Time constraints
are the norm, and the stress of adding one more element to the mix,
such as a personal fitness routine, can be daunting. Often it seems
that in order to add in fitness, something else has to be sacrificed.
In reality, this sacrifice is already taking place: your fitness is being
sacrificed so that all the other priorities can be met. Now, no one is
suggesting shirking work and family responsibilities in order to take
up a fitness routine. This point is made very well by the pre-takeoff
safety talk heard when travelling by airplane. In describing the
proper use of the oxygen mask the flight attendant instructs the
traveler to secure his or her own mask, before helping children and
others. Why? Because if we do not take care of ourselves, we are
useless to others.
Taking care of ourselves is truly the best way to ensure that we will
be there to take care of the people and responsibilities in our lives.
In addition to cardiovascular health, weight control and muscle tone,
study upon study has shown a decrease in stress and an increase in
energy and productivity directly attributable to physical fitness.
Swimming in particular is cited by many of these studies as the
single most beneficial fitness activity for adults, due to its longevity
as a viable activity, as well as the low incidence of negative affects
associated with it.
The bottom line is time management. Finding an hour or so in the
day, three to four days a week is a challenge. Some people find it
before work, some at lunchtime, others find that hour on the way
home from work. Some people do it with their children nearby, some
do it in rotation with their spouse, some even do it with their cell
phone or pager on the edge of the pool. All in all, making the time
to devote to one’s own fitness is a decisive way to improve quality
of life over the long term.

HURDLE #2
Breaking out of the Sedentary Lifestyle
It is an accepted fact that human beings reach their physical peak
around the age of 18 to 21, and that after that age, the natural aging
process leads to a slow decline in strength, endurance, speed and
flexibility. But is the rate of this natural aging process related more to
chronological age or physiological age? We all know 55-year-olds who
can jump higher, run faster, and swim farther than some 30-year-olds.
The crucial factor in the natural aging process is activity level.
By the time we reach our 20s, without maintaining the physical
activity level of our youth, the growth of fast twitch muscle fiber
decreases, weight gain occurs as metabolism slows, cardiovascular
ability declines, and joints stiffen.
Now those people who have maintained an active lifestyle without a
break since they were teenagers will have little adjustment to make
when taking up an activity like Masters swimming. But for most of
us, this is not the case. For most of us, a sedentary lifestyle has
taken hold. From working at a desk all day, to child bearing and
rearing, our level of physical activity is far less than it was when we
were younger. Regaining a physically active body is surely a
challenge but not an insurmountable one.
Breaking free of a sedentary lifestyle is not something that will yield
immediate results. It is a process of rebuilding, and it will take time.
The longer the break, the longer it can take. But remember, in taking
on the lifestyle of an adult athlete, it is not only the goal that is
important, it is the process. The hardest part is to take the first
step...or stroke. Swimming is an ideal fitness activity for adults who
have been sedentary for any length of time. The non-impact nature
of swimming makes joint pain less of an issue during activity. The
reduced gravity environment of the water means that weight gain is
not as much of a hindrance as it is in many other sports. Because
swimming uses every major muscle group, cardiovascular benefits
begin right away. Stroke by stroke you can swim your way to fitness.

HURDLE #3
Making a Commitment
Becoming motivated to take up a fitness routine as an adult, such as
Masters swimming is one half in making a commitment. Staying
motivated is the other. Making a commitment means you are in for
the long haul. And it won’t always be easy. Things will get in your
way. There will be disruptions to your routine. Measurable results
may be hard for you to see sometimes. You might become tired,
discouraged, and maybe sore at first.
Taking one day at a time is essential. Be forgiving to yourself. If you
miss a day, oh well! One day will not make or break your fitness
routine. Getting back on track is an important part of maintaining
your commitment.
Remember, there is no timetable. Avoid making goals that measure
success and failure, like: “By March 15, I am going to swim 100 yards
in a minute.” Choose instead to measure your progress with
statements such as: “At first it took me 22 strokes to cross the pool,
now it only takes me 18.”
Let things develop, and believe in what you are doing. Never give
up. Enjoy the process of building your fitness. Take pride in yourself.
Are you ready to make a commitment? Come on, take the plunge!

MASTERS SWIMMING VS.LAP SWIM
So you have decided to take up swimming as your adult fitness
routine. You have taken the steps of making time in your schedule,
and have found a convenient swimming pool. Now what?
Most pools offer Lap Swim, when the pool is open for swimmers to
basically do their own thing. Many lap swims are organized into
sections for slower, medium and faster swimmers. Lap swims usually
have a lane pattern so that swimmers, like drivers on the road, do
not bump into each other while they share a lane. Lap swimming
20

Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:30 Uhr Seite 21

offers swimmers the opportunity to swim at their own pace, swim
what and how they choose to, and stop and go when they want.
There are drawbacks however. Lap swims can get crowded, and with
everyone’s perception of “fast” and “slow” being different, lane
congestion can develop, leading to impatience by some swimmers,
comparable to “road rage.” Each lap swimmer’s routine is different.
For instance, while you might want to swim 20 lengths without
stopping, the person in front of you might want to stop at the wall
after each length for a minute or two. You may be swimming the
breaststroke, and the person behind you is tailgating you doing
freestyle. Lap swim can be frustrating for many swimmers. Others
find the lap swim environment perfectly acceptable. It remains a
popular program at many pools.
Deciding what to swim is the next issue. You could just get in and
swim back and forth for the entire time you have set aside for your
swimming. You could create your own routine of various strokes and
distances. But what sort of swimming activities will help develop
fitness best and most quickly? Choosing the best swimming activities
is a difficult task for many swimmers and can easily lead to time
wasted, lack of focus, boredom and loss of motivation. Even for the
experienced swimmer, creating a workout and then doing it is a
challenge and a hard routine to stick to.

Masters Swimming
The alternative is the Masters swimming environment that offers
many benefits that lap swim does not. In Masters swimming, a
structured workout is provided, other swimmers do that workout
with you, and feedback is available about your swimming. For many
swimmers, joining a Masters swim team has been an important
factor in staying with their swimming routine.
Having the workout provided by a coach changes the activity from
just swimming into training. The challenge of doing the workout
from start to finish is quite appealing to many swimmers.
Experienced Masters swim coaches create workouts designed to
build endurance, speed and versatility, and improve technique.
Workouts are planned with enough variety to keep swimmers
engaged during the workout and interested enough to come back for
subsequent workouts. Some Masters swim teams have themed
workouts for each day of the week, for instance “Fin Monday” or
“Sprint Friday.” Some teams offer special workouts for seniors,
commuters and other groups.
Doing the workout with other swimmers is very motivating to most
people. With the workout as a common activity, swimmers usually
find that they swim with more energy than they would by
themselves. Being with a group of swimmers who are all doing the
same workout creates a supportive environment, as well as an
opportunity for competition, for those who want it. In Masters
swimming workouts, swimmers are usually grouped by speed, which
leads to smoother running lanes.
Finally, the Masters swimming environment offers the opportunity
for stroke improvement. Having a coach analyze your swimming
and suggest ways to improve is extremely helpful. Then, thinking
about the feedback you get also gives you something to concentrate
on when you might instead be thinking about how hard the workout
is. No matter what level swimmer you are, there are many ways you
can improve your stroke. Swimming technique is studied and
practiced by Olympic champions as much as it is by beginners.
Improving your swimming technique will only make swimming easier
and more enjoyable.

SOCIAL ASPECTS OF MASTERS SWIMMING
The strong social atmosphere present in many Masters swimming
programs is a valued part of most swimmers’ experience. Being part
of a stable social group is something that often seems to get set
aside in the busy lives of many adults. The camaraderie of Masters
swimming begins during workout, and often blossoms into lasting
friendships carried on beyond the pool. Masters swimmers socialize
in many ways including:
Workout Style Conversation
An interesting phenomenon common to most Masters swimming
workouts is a developing a conversation that is strung together by
the sets of the workout. Each set is punctuated by another minute or

two in a continuing light-hearted dialogue, and then is suspended
until the next rest break, where it is resumed seamlessly until the
next set begins. Some interesting subjects covered by this kind of
intellectual workout chat have included:
• How peanuts grow, and whether they are really nuts
• The best places to travel in the Caribbean
• Menopause
• The role siblings order plays in personality traits
• Do watermelons float
• Good dentists
• Features of new water heaters
Social Kicking
Whether or not you believe that kick boards are beneficial to
swimming, they play an important role in Masters swimming. During
social kicking sets, swimmers kick side by side, catching up on news
and making weekend plans. Conversations are also carried out
across the pool, one swimmer kicking in Lane 2 and the other in
Lane 6. Jokes are shared. Dinner dates are made. “Happy birthday”
is sung. All this goes on while swimmers are in motion, propelled by

their leg action and floppy feet, accomplishing 200 or more yards of
kicking, building their fitness while they build their friendships.
Aquatic Networking
At one point, there might be three architects, four teachers, two
doctors, and three attorneys swimming in the pool at once. This
presents quite an opportunity for shop talk. There are also times
when the skills of swimmers in transition, between jobs, are brought
to the attention of other swimmer/professionals and swimmers who
own small businesses.
The resources of the Masters swimmers in the pool at any one time
are quite extensive. One swimmer’s house might be painted by a
house painter on the team. The car of one swimmer might have a
stereo installed by an audio professional from the pool. A swimmer
might even find a pet sitter at workout.
Food Talk
About three-quarters of the way through a workout, when calories are
running low, the topic of conversation inevitably turns to food.
Spontaneously, swimmers begin to describe their desired post-workout
snack or special treat with immense enthusiasm. Among the delicacies
that have been shared aloud, in order of frequency mentioned are:
• Pancakes
• Bananas
• Oatmeal
• Cheesecake
• Ice Cream
In a sport where athletes can burn upwards of 600 calories per hour,
shared cravings during workout often result in a group outing to a
café or restaurant afterward, or the exchange of recipes.

Making Friends
While Masters swimmers are each unique in personality, background,
lifestyle and occupation, they are all joined by their swimming.
This common ground
becomes the base of
many friendships. Shared
experiences in the pool
create a strong bond
between swimmers. People
who might never cross
paths otherwise build
strong relationships in the
pool. Pool time creates
a kind of springboard for
many lasting friendships outside the water. For many, the friendships
made through swimming are a major reason to keep swimming.
Being Part of a Team
Masters swimming offers a sense of team that many adults have not
experienced since they were children. Belonging to a team gives us a
feeling of being part of something larger than ourselves. This group
identity puts things into a different perspective for us. It gives us a
further reason to strive for higher goals. “Doing it for the team” is a
great feeling. It makes us press on, when alone we might quit. It
makes us encourage each other. It makes us cheer!

A Brief History of Masters
Swimming
Masters Swimming was so named following the lead of Masters
Track & Field, one of the only associations representing adult
athletes at the time. Many people are still confused by the name
“Masters swimming,” which brings to mind elite level athletics,
rather than the more encompassing population that the association
truly stands for. Some Masters swimmers have suggested that the
name be changed to “Veteran Swimming” or “Adult Swimming” to be
more accurate. But the way Masters began explains the name.
Masters swimming began when Captain Ransom J. Arthur had an
idea to hold a swim meet for adults in Texas. Arthur, a Navy doctor,
wanted to spark interest in swimming as fitness and encourage
adults to take up the sport to maintain and improve their health. His
idea was to bring together ex-competitive swimmers and Olympians
of years past from all over the United States for the event in order to
gain publicity for his cause. The swim meet drew overwhelming
response from retired swimmers all over the world. And the event
netted the media attention Captain Arthur was seeking.
His swim meet marked the official beginning of Masters swimming in
the United States in May 1970, with the first Masters National
Swimming Championships.
The Federation Internationale Natation, FINA, the international
governing body of competitive swimming, followed suit, adding
references to Masters swimming in its Rule Book as of 1972.
Today, Masters swimming is organized and active on five continents,
in countries including: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China,
Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Great Britain, Hungary, Italy, Japan,
Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Scotland, Slovenia, South Africa,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates, and the
United States.

The Many Faces of
Masters Swimming
Every Masters swimmer has a unique story. During many years of
coaching, I have been privileged to share many of them.
Here are a few of the many faces of Masters swimming.
3.1
THE RETIRED CHAMPION
Larry, a busy attorney, is nearing 50.
He drops in at workouts frequently,
but not on any particular schedule, without commitment, and knocks
out a couple thousand to ease his aching back. No sports bottle
containing an electrolyte-balancing drink for him: coffee is his
poolside beverage of choice. His swimming is flawless and graceful.
He understands swimming like the back of his hand. “Nice
backstroke, Larry!” I comment from the deck between sets. My words
evoke a smile as he pushes off for some last sprints. Larry, you see,
was a top college backstroker, about a quarter century ago. He swam
in a relay with Mark Spitz. The years have not dimmed his talent,
either. One day, I clocked him off the wall for a 100 backstroke. He
swam the four lengths in under a minute, without breaking a sweat.
“So, Larry,” I used to regularly ask him. “When am I going to see
you in a meet?” His expression would change, from the carefree
swimmer who is one with the water, to that of an over-worked
professional, asked to do one more thing. “Not me,” he would reply.
“My swim meet days are over.” Although his time as an elite
collegiate athlete was punctuated by accolades and medals, his
memories of the four-year experience left him with the mindset that
he never, ever wants to swim like that again: the seemingly endless
workouts, the thousands upon thousands of mindless yards day
after day, the coach who was never satisfied, and the constant
feeling of being tired yet being expected to perform with the best at
competitions. Most of all, the total absence of joy is what Larry
recalls, and he doesn’t want to feel that way again.

Take the Plunge!
Having been a swimmer in the same era of “no pain, no gain,” and
“the more yards, the better,” I know this feeling well. But in my
capacity as a Masters coach, one day I gently pressed the issue.
“Larry, I’ll make you a deal.” His ears perked up, and I continued, “If
you just keep swimming, I’ll just keep coaching. And if we keep
going until we are 60, we’ll swim in a meet together, okay?” He got a
kick out of the challenge, and laughed out loud. And then said,
“You’re on!”
So, we’ve made a pact. Larry will keep his aching back at bay, and I
will keep his time in the water fun, then in ten years or so, we will
create a new swim meet memory, a kinder, gentler one, which will
perhaps leave the other one in the dust.

THE FITNESS SWIMMER
Diane swims religiously three days a week,
arriving punctually at the beginning of the
workout and leaving exactly an hour and a
half later. She happily swims in Lane 2, where
she has swum for six years, with familiar lane
mates and a familiar low-key atmosphere. There is no judgment cast
when someone in the lane does a one-arm butterfly or swims a set
with fins. It is not looked at as “cheating” as it might be by some
swimmers in other lanes. The swimmers in her lane are friendly and
courteous, and cooperatively change their order, depending on the
set, or the way each person is feeling that day.
Balancing her career and her family effectively, Diane is the mother
of two kids who works 9 to 5 as a project manager. Swimming is
what she calls “her own time,” and she is content to swim on a
comfortable interval, taking the second or third position in kicking
sets, and being the caboose for pulling sets. Diane is happy to have
a coach on deck but would be just as content doing a workout
posted on a board, as long as her lane mates were doing it with her.
Although she has an ongoing interest in improving her stroke
efficiency, Diane has no aspirations of moving up to Lane 3, breaking

THE POST-COLLEGIATE ATHLETE
Jonas was waiting at
the gate one morning
when I arrived to open the
pool at 5:45 am, towel around his neck, pull buoy under his arm,
and goggles on his forehead. “I’d like to swim with you,” he
announced. “Great,” I replied, sensing the commitment in his voice.
“I’ll get the pool covers off while you change.” “I’m already in my
suit,” he responded, as if to underscore his preparedness. “Okay, I’ll
have water for you in about three minutes,” I said. “I’ll just do some
stretching,” he said, intent on letting me know that he knew the
swimmers’ routine. “I have them warm up for about fifteen minutes,”
I explained while rolling up the pool covers. “I ask them to do
between 500 and 800 yards.”
Soon enough, he was in the water, having chosen an outside lane
even though it was clear that he had the speed. It was as if he was
waiting for me to invite him to Lane 4, the lane reserved for the
fastest swimmers. When he accomplished 1000 during warm up, I
did ask him to join the fast lane. He started at the back of the line
and worked his way, set by set up to the lead position. His
swimming was powerful; the details were practiced. He put 100%
into every set and didn’t once miss his time on the pace clock. “So
where did you swim?” I asked him between sets. He gave a quick
resumé, which included four years at a Division 1 university and

three years before that on the Swedish Nationals Team. He had just
moved into town and been swimming consistently since college. He
was clearly a freestyler/ backstroker, and he apologized that butterfly
was not his strong point. He was no prima donna, communicating
effectively but seriously about intervals and set details with the
other swimmers in the lane.
At the end of workout, he was last to get out of the pool. When he
hopped spryly out, he approached me. “So, can I swim with you?”
he asked as if he had been trying out. Following his lead, I
responded, “You made the cut!” He smiled and then proceeded to
lay out the training schedule he intended to do. Curious, I asked
him, “So what are your swimming goals?” “Just fitness,” he replied
decisively. “Okay,” I said. “See you Wednesday morning.”
So, Jonas made a routine of swimming with me, for fitness. After
further inquiry, I learned that in college, he had been ranked among
the top distance freestylers in the nation. Now, at age 30, I watched
him take on 4 x 500 with descending 100 splits, and lactate
threshold sets with purpose. But what purpose? Fitness? Both he and
I knew this goal could be accomplished with much less effort. So,
what was it? Unfinished business, I determined, after drawing out of
him over time that he hadn’t quite met his goals in college. This
swimmer had something to prove to himself, and although it was yet
to be defined aloud, he was building. And whatever shape the
inevitable test takes, competition, or timed practice swim, Jonas has
a mission, and it is a pleasure to be a part of it, and to believe in
him every step of the way.

THE FIRST-TIME ATHLETE
Liz was a self-described nerd growing up.
She was very focused on academics and
got outstanding grades, leading her to receive
a full scholarship to an Ivy League school. Again in college
she excelled, earning double degrees in biology and international
health. After graduation, she was the first pick of the largest
biotech company on the west coast. Liz was well on her way.

By age 28, she had earned the esteem of her colleagues through her
ground-breaking work in disease prevention. She was even quoted
as an authority in her field in a New York Times about the strides in
the biotech industry. With her career was established, Liz made a
conscious decision to make a change in her life, to broaden her
horizons, to do something completely new. She decided to take up
Masters swimming.
With only the knowledge and experience of the mandatory high
school swimming class she had taken ten years before, Liz
researched Masters swimming in her vicinity, purchased a swim suit,
goggles, and nose clip and showed up at a workout one Monday
evening after work. She introduced herself and asked, “How good do
you have to be to join this team?” I explained that our team was
made up of swimmers of all levels and that previous competitive
swimming experience was not required. She seemed to be relieved
by my answer. I continued to give her an overview of the program.
She told me that she really wanted to be a Masters swimmer and
had already sent in her application to join the regional Masters
swimming association.
When she got in the pool, she stood waist deep and spent a great
deal of time adjusting her new goggles. Her nose clip was next, and
then finally I watched her push off the bottom and swim head up
freestyle for about half a length, then to the far wall doing
breaststroke with scissor kick, still without getting her face wet. She
rested on the wall for a while and then swam back toward me in the
same way, snatching at the water with every stroke. She arrived
exhausted. “So, may I make some comments about your stroke?” I
asked her gently. “Yes, please!” she responded, eager to absorb any
tips to help her gain the proficiency she was used to feeling in the
rest of her life.
“Moving through water is a funny thing,” I began. “It works best
when we don’t fight it.” She was clearly curious. “The thing I think
would help you most is to develop a good floating position.”
“Okay, how do I do that?” she urged me on. “It is important to hold
your body in a streamlined position,” I said, “including your head.
34

This means you have to swim with your face in the water, looking
down at the bottom of the pool.” “Okay, I can do that,” she
responded and submerged her whole head immediately. “Swimming
with your face out of the water is like swimming uphill, and that is
hard,” I told her. I went on step by step to describe the basics of
breathing while swimming, using long strokes, leverage, and
effective kicking. She tried everything I offered.
“I had no idea that swimming was so technical,” she said at the end
of the workout. “Yes!” I replied, “There is a lot of science to good
swimming.” “Well, I should be good at that!” she stated confidently.
“I’ll be back tomorrow. Thank you!”
Liz swam in her first swim meet seven months after joining the team.
She swam a 50 freestyle, including a flip turn. She swam it without
her nose clip. She finished fifth out of six in her age group, and she
was elated by her accomplishment as was I.

THE WEEKEND WARRIOR
Dale makes his appearance on Saturday
and Sundays, swimming in Lane 3 on
Saturday and usually Lane 2 on Sunday.
He is a very outgoing guy and always greets his fellow swimmers
cheerfully, as if he hasn’t seen them in a week, which he hasn’t.
Dale’s swimming speed is good enough to place him in the second
fastest lane, largely because of his swim team experience in high
school about twenty years ago.
Dale enjoys the workout setting of Masters swimming and the good-
natured peer pressure of his lane mates during hard sets. Dale much
prefers sprints to distance swimming. In sprint sets, he can maintain
first or second position in his lane. During longer swims, however, he
takes the rear. He knows that about halfway through a swim of 200
yards or more, he will need to stand up, and while pretending to
adjust his goggles, allows his lane mates, who are catching up to
him, to pass him up. On these longer swims, Dale stops when the
group finishes, even though he still has two laps to go.

Near the end of workout, I watch Dale conscientiously tap the wall to
start each 8 x 50, and then walk out ten yards before actually
starting to swim.
Dale complains about shoulder problems when a set includes
butterfly. It is only once in a while I’ve seen him do butterfly, and
then for only a few strokes, before it turns into freestyle. I am sure
that the shoulder pain he feels is real, not a way to avoid a
strenuous set. But I also believe his pain is not from a technique
problem, which is the first thing I analyze when a swimmer mentions
shoulder problems. Instead, I am convinced it stems from infrequent,
vigorous swimming, which is why by Sunday he joins the less
intense folks in Lane 2.
“Dale,” I say, “Can I get you to add a workout in the middle of the
week?” “I only have weekends,” he replies. I persist. “I really think a
mid-week swim, even a short one, would help your shoulder
stability.” “I’m just too busy,” he states. “Okay, then I’ll give you
some stretch band exercises to do during the week. They will really
help you.”
Dale thanks me with a smile, and continues to swim, as if I hadn’t
even brought it up.

THE OPEN WATER SWIMMER
It wasn’t Juliet’s backstroke
that impressed me the first
time I saw her swim. It was that
freestyle. Her elbow stayed high as she anchored her hand firmly in
the water. She advanced without slipping past her long leading arm,
stroke after stroke, consistently for 100, 200, 500 or 1000 yards. She
seemed to gain speed as she swam, instead of settling into a pace,
or running out of gas, which is physiologically more common.
Juliet had been lap swimming for exercise for a few months when
she noticed my flyer on the bulletin board in the pool lobby that
said in large print “Swimmers Wanted!” along with an invitation to

adults of all ages to come join our Masters Swim Team. Juliet joined
us with the idea that she would work toward equaling her
high school 100 backstroke time, a challenge, but not an
unattainable one. She was 25 years old, strong, lean and very
determined. She enjoyed working out, she enjoyed swim meets, and
she enjoyed challenges.
We worked on backstroke sets, and her time certainly did improve.
She regularly placed in the top three in her age group at local
competitions. But the meat and potatoes of each workout was
freestyle. And hers got stronger and stronger. She was great at
descending sets of 200s. Five, ten, or more, she swam them with
precision, descending by a second or two each 200. Although sprint
sets were not her forte, because she struggled to get her turnover up
to speed quickly, she gave it her best just the same.
One day, a teammate brought a flyer to the workout announcing a
rough-water swim across Lake Tahoe. It was a six-person relay swim,
11.5 miles across the lake, from Nevada to California. A boat was
required to accompany each team, and in relay order the swimmers
were to swim for half an hour each, then fifteen minutes each, and
then ten minutes each, until they reached the finish line. Instantly,
this is what everyone wanted to do, including Juliet. This was her
debut into open water swimming.
Lake Tahoe was cold, about 55 degrees. It was windy and wavy, and
hard to stay on course. While the high altitude slowed the swimming
of about half the team, sea sickness took its toll on others. Then
there was Juliet...she was in heaven! She felt a freedom she had
never experienced in the pool. There were no walls to break her
swimming rhythm, no laps to count, no constricting lane lines, just
water as far as the eye could see.
Juliet was hooked! She entered every lake and ocean event
announced, and by the end of her second season was ranked #2
in open water points in the region. As for the backstroke, she is
still our medley relay lead-off swimmer, but her heart belongs to
the open water.

THE TRIATHLETE
At age 50, Kurt has 3 percent body fat,
and a resting heart rate of 40. He is
an accomplished runner and cyclist, putting
in hundreds of miles training each sport every month.
But swimming is another story. Seven years ago,
when Kurt first appeared at a workout, he announced that he
was going to do a Triathlon in four months, and that he wanted
to improve his swimming for that reason. He told me that he had
to be able to swim 2.4 miles by then, and that he would like
my help. When he got in the water, I nearly jumped in after
him when he approached the deep end. He was struggling.
Kurt was unarguably an athlete. He was strong, fit and able to do
more than most 20 year olds...on land. But in the water, he flailed.
Technique-wise, there was a lot I could help him with, but there were
other issues that made swimming hard for him. Right away, I noticed
that the flexibility of Kurt’s feet only went in one direction, that of a
runner and cyclist. The ligaments in the front of his ankle were so
tight that he could not point his toes, making his kicking ineffective
at best. I also noticed that Kurt’s posture standing, and in the water,
remained as if he was on a racing bike, hunched over at the
shoulders. He had a hard time reaching his arm out straight, making
streamlining a basic problem.
On the bright side, Kurt had excellent core strength, the muscle tone
of a teenager, a thorough understanding of the principles of
conditioning, and intense will power. I decided the best approach to
help Kurt reach his goal was to work his strong points and work
around his limitations. We worked on body roll and initiating his
swimming from his hips so he could get the most from his strong
core. We worked on body position so he wasn’t exhausting himself
kicking to keep his legs from sinking. We worked on aligning his arm
stroke from his armpit to his thumb, in order to create a more
effective catch phase in his stroke.

Kurt’s drive and willingness to make changes led him to improve
quickly. It wasn’t long before he was swimming laps without
stopping. We measured his efficiency by counting strokes per lap. He
was able to develop what I call “quiet swimming,” which was low on
the excess splash. After three months, he was able to do a set of 20
x 50 and hold a steady pace. As the date of his triathlon event grew
closer he asked me, “Do you think I can really do it?” “Yes, Kurt,” I
responded, “I do. I think you have made huge strides in your
swimming in a very short time. You know what you have to do. You
just have to swim like you have been practicing: long and efficient. It
will be hard, but you have the endurance, and you have the skill.”
“Okay”, he said with conviction.
Kurt came back two weeks later from Hawaii with a new Ironman
tattoo around his ankle. “I did it!” he stated simply. “You did it,
Kurt!” I echoed, my hand raised for a high five. After a minute of
proud silence he said, “The next one is in six months. Are you up for
it?” I was slightly taken aback by his question. It was as if I was the
one in training. “You know, I really couldn’t have done it without
you, coach,” he said in a quiet voice. I smiled and answered, “You
just keep swimming, Mr. Ironman!” And he has. Kurt has competed
in 14 triathlons in the past seven years. His swimming has improved
consistently, with his 2.4-mile swim time now over 40 minutes faster
than the first time he swam it in Hawaii.

THE RENAISANCE ATHLETE
It had been a while since
Tami had taken on a
swimming challenge
with so much dedication.
The intensity of college swimming had been over for a few
years. She had joined Masters swimming at age 23 just for fun
and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere and friendly company
immensely. She attended workouts fairly regularly and had
fun swimming without the pressures of college athletics.

Eventually though, it became clear that competition was still
in her heart, and she set her sights on Masters Nationals.
She dedicated herself to an intense training schedule, including
weight lifting and “doubles,” days where she did two workouts per
day. She gave up sugar for ten weeks. She led her lane and worked
her splits. She challenged herself in every way, inspiring other
swimmers in the pool with her self-discipline.
When she emerged from the Master Swimming Short Course National
Championships, she had a new bounce in her step, new confidence
in her swimming, and the knowledge that all her work was worth it.
Tami took off a total of more than 60 seconds in five events over the
course of the meet!
She began with the 400 IM. She took the lead on the very first lap
and never relinquished it. She turned in her best 100 fly and
breaststroke times of the season as splits in the 400 IM! She
finished the race in 5:11.96, eliminating 20 seconds from her entry
time, placing 6th. Next, she swam the 50 fly. Matching her college
time, she swam a 28.95, placing 10th.
Tami’s father flew in from Los Angeles for the final two days of the
meet, arriving just in time for Tami’s 500 freestyle. Setting a fast
pace early on, she finished the 20 pool lengths in 5:42.77, erasing
another 20 seconds from her entry time and placing 9th. Then she
swam the 100 fly, demolishing her time by six seconds, coming in at
1:02.70, 7th place, and very near to her best college time. Great!
The final day, she took her most challenging event head on: the 200
fly. With dreams, but no expectations, she took to the block.
When the dust had cleared, Tami touched the wall in 3rd place in
an amazing time of 2:17.78, a 14-second improvement that brought
her back to her best year in college. A smile lit up her face.
Acompetitor was reborn.

THE LIFELONG ATHLETE
Bernie has been voted
“Most Inspirational Swimmer”
unanimously by his teammates
two years in a row. He is a very special person, who has befriended
many of his teammates, frequently connecting with them outside the
pool for plays, museum openings, conversations over gourmet
coffee. He greets every swimmer by name, even if he has only met
them once. He loves to celebrate holidays and brings a small trinket
for the coach every Easter, Halloween and Christmas. Bernie has
been described by his fellow swimmers as genuine, brotherly, and
wise. He is a very important presence at our workouts. Bernie swims
twice a day, without fail, putting in a good hour at each workout.
Before taking up swimming, he was a dedicated long distance
runner, and had been since his youth. It was an essential part of his
identity and athletic spirit, until his knees would no longer allow it.
It was a sad day when he had to stop running.
I met Bernie one Saturday, when he dropped in on my Swimming
Technique class, asking if I could give him some pointers on
swimming the front crawl. He explained he had recently retired from
running and that he wanted to try swimming as a way to stay active.
Bernie was a muscular man, about 45, I guessed, with a humble
manner about him.
He was comfortable with the water but not with his swimming. With
his extensive endurance running background, there was no question
that he could keep going with fifty or more strokes per length, but
he was working too hard to enjoy swimming. As we developed his
stroke, he contemplated every correction carefully, practiced, asked
good questions, and practiced some more. He quickly became a
regular at Masters workouts, in Lane 6, making friends, observing
the other swimmers strokes, and sharing the techniques he had

most recently incorporated into his stroke with his lane mates.
Swimming became his new passion. Soon, with the encouragement
of his teammates, he entered a local swim meet.
Bernie entered the 50 freestyle in the 65-69 age group! I was
astonished. Not only was he the only swimmer on the block without
silver hair and wrinkles, he was the only swimmer who sprinted!
Bernie’s years of running had preserved him well. There was no loss
of muscle tone, no flexibility or posture indications that Bernie was a
senior citizen. His body was young, except for his knees, and
Masters swimming was just the sport for him to reap the rewards of
being a lifelong athlete.
Bernie’s performance at that first swim meet was the beginning of a
bright new chapter in his life. He had found a new community, and
he had found a way to let the athlete in him continue to live.

Check in with Your Doctor
When you fill out the Masters Swimming Membership Application,
you will be asked to acknowledge that you have been in contact
with a physician and have been given the “okay” to participate in
Masters swimming. Even without this requirement, letting your
healthcare provider know that you plan to take up Masters
swimming may seem unnecessary, but it is a wise idea. You will most
likely make your doctor’s day when you describe your intentions
because you will be making a lifestyle change that will make you a
healthier person. Your doctor knows that he or she will have to do
less nagging about your weight, cholesterol, and blood pressure,
among other issues when you swim regularly.
Any health concerns you or your doctor have can be discussed,
including asthma, heart condition, diabetes, hypertension,
osteoporosis, so you can make a plan to “swim around” these
issues, rather than ignore them. By making such a plan, you will
avoid the chance of becoming discouraged with the Masters
swimming experience. Usually, even with health limitations, your
doctor will be highly encouraging, as the benefits of swimming
highly outweigh any risks. Expect your doctor to be pleased that you
are taking positive steps to improve your health, then begin the
experience of Masters swimming with confidence.

Equipment
2.1
SWIMSUIT
A distinction should be made between a bathing suit and a
swimsuit. Whereas a bathing suit is selected largely for looks, as its
purpose is for sun bathing, the swimsuit is designed for swimming.
Function should be the primary consideration when selecting a
swimsuit. Your swimsuit needs to fit snugly to avoid drag, but allow
you to move comfortably and freely at full extension.
Swimsuits designed for training are now made of fabric that is
resistant to chlorine, which is a great feature for frequent swimmers.
Swimsuits designed for competition are made of high-tech fabric,
which repels water and streamlines the body, as swimmers strive to
shave off any possible drag. These competition suits are not
designed to be worn everyday, as the fabric is not chlorine-resistant.
2.2
SWIM CAP
If you have long hair, a cap is a must in order to keep your hair out
of your face while swimming. Hair can interfere with breathing, and it
can restrict your arm movements if it is long enough to go under
your arms while you stroke.
Even with short hair, many swimmers choose to wear a cap. A swim
cap lessens drag. It keeps your head warm. It keeps the sun off your
head. It also protects the hair somewhat from chlorine damage,
although the hair does not stay dry under a cap.
2.3
GOGGLES
When many of us were kids, goggles were not an essential piece of
our swim equipment. They had not been developed beyond the
cumbersome scuba type masks, which covered the nose, making
them inappropriate for competitive swimming. As youth swimmers,
46

--- Page 47 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:31 Uhr Seite 47
Masters Swimming Readiness
we went to school from swim practice with red, burning eyes, which
lasted far into the day.
Now, goggles have been designed with competitive swimmers in
mind, with features including adjustable nose bridge and head
straps, UV protection, and a variety of shapes to fit just about
anyone’s face. You can even get prescription goggles for vision
correction!
The goggles of today are light and comfortable. Swimmers do their
whole workout with goggles, including backstroke. They compete
with goggles, including diving. Red, burning eyes have become a
thing of the past.
2.4
KICKBOARD
Some pools have kickboards for their patrons. If not, you may
purchase your own kickboard, but check with the coach of the swim
team that you are joining to see if kickboards are used. Some
coaches believe that kickboards do not promote good body position
in swimming, so they have their swimmers do kicking activities
without kickboards.
Kickboards do provide floatation to the upper body and allow the
swimmer to kick with their head out of the water, but some
swimmers struggle to make forward progress when using them. If
kickboards are a part of the team’s program, choosing the
appropriate kickboard is important. Select one that is no longer than
the distance from your wrist to your armpit. Otherwise, the kickboard
can be stressful to the shoulders, and an “uphill” kicking position is
almost insured, making kicking more work.
A properly fitting kickboard makes kicking a pleasant variation from
face in the water activities.

2.5
PULL BUOY
Apull buoy is a float held between the legs, above the knees. Some pools
provide pull buoys for their patrons’use. The pull buoy is a favorite piece
of equipment for many swimmers. It allows the upper body to be used,
but floats the legs so no kicking is required. For some swimmers, a pull
buoy corrects their floatation and body position to the point that pulling is
actually easier than swimming.
Pull buoys come in a variety of styles and sizes. Swimmers can select the
style they find most comfortable. The correct size of a pull buoy is
determined by the swimmer’s size and weight. Aproperly fitting pull buoy
provides enough floatation so the swimmer’s hips don’t sink, but not so
much that the lower back takes extra stress.
Some swimmers are able to pull well and comfortably without a pull buoy.
2.6
HAND PADDLES
Caution should be exercised when using hand paddles because,
without proper stroke technique, the extra shoulder stress produced
by using paddles can result in injury. Any shoulder pain should not be
ignored! If even the slightest shoulder pain occurs, take the paddles
off and ask for help with your stroke before using the paddles again.
Paddles should be selected in the right size, which is only slightly
larger than the hand. When they are too big, they can cause
shoulder problems. Paddles are usually used while pulling and
sometimes for swimming, too. Paddles are not often recommended
for strokes other than freestyle. They should not be used for more
than one quarter of a swimmer’s workout.
Paddles are used to increase the resistance of the water, allowing
the swimmer to work harder and to develop a more effective stroke
path. While using paddles, the swimmer feels like he or she has
more of a “handle” on the water. Aswimmer can then try to replicate
this “handle” when the paddles are taken off. Paddles are very
beneficial for giving the swimmer immediate technique feedback on
the entry and exit of the stroke. An incorrect motion in the water at
these points will cause the paddle to pull off, showing the swimmer
a specific problem area to work on.

2.7
FINS
Many coaches do not believe in fins because they feel that
swimmers become dependent on them. Certainly, fins give a
swimmer the feeling of speed, and going fast is fun. But going fast
can also be a beneficial feeling for a swimmer to experience and
then to strive for without fins. Fins should not be used for the
majority of kicking activities or a swimmer may forget how to kick
without them. Kicking with fins should always be faster than without
fins because fins provide a larger surface area with which to move
water. If you kick only the same speed as you go without fins, then
you are not working as hard as you would without fins. This is not
the point of wearing fins.
Fins can be used to help swimmers feel the importance of the kick in
strokes where the kick is a frequent problem, including the butterfly
and backstroke. Fins should not be used for breaststroke because
the extra resistance produces too much stress on the knees.
If fins are a part of your swim team program, selecting the right fin is
important. Even if fins are provided by the pool for patrons to use, it
is a good idea to get your own. It is important for fins to fit
absolutely correctly, or they will encourage incorrect kicking. The fin
should not be too long. A long fin promotes a slower kick.
Competitive swimmers need to kick fast, so choose a shorter fin. The
fin should be fairly flexible, to simulate the fluid, tail-like effect that
an ideal kick has. The fin should also not squeeze the foot, so that
the swimmer holds back their effort, to avoid foot pain. Fins are fun,
and they have benefits but remember that every swimmer should be
comfortable kicking with his or her own feet!
2.8
WATER BOTTLE
Staying hydrated is the last thing many swimmers think about when
they are surrounded by water. But even if you cannot feel yourself
sweat, swimmers lose a great deal of water while they workout. For
this reason, many swimmers bring water bottles with them to the
edge of the pool. Many swimmers drink water. Some drink sports
drinks containing minerals and sugar. Some swimmers drink
solutions designed to help the body recover after workout.

PACE CLOCK
The pace clock is a standard piece of equipment for any swim team
workout. It is a large face clock, visible to swimmers in the pool. The
pace clock has a second hand and a minute hand that swimmers use
to get immediate feedback about the speed of their swimming. They
can also time their rest. Before the pace clock was designed in the
1950s, by Doc Counsilman, a very influential American swim coach,
swimmers depended on their coaches to call out their times,
measure their rest, and to set them off on their next swim on
schedule. In situations with more than a few swimmers in the pool
at once, coaches were only able to get some of the swimmers’ times
accurately. Although many coaches still call out times, the pace clock
allows swimmers to take charge of their workout.
The pace clock makes working out a more interactive activity.
Swimmers are able to see all of their own swim times, stay on their
interval, and check their pace. Many swimmers consider the pace
clock to be their primary workout partner.
3.2
LANE LINES
Lane lines, or the floats strung together over the length of the pool,
have three purposes. First, they divide the pool into areas, which
allow more swimmers to swim in an organized and safe manner in a
limited space. Second, they provide a guide for swimmers to swim
more on course, especially in backstroke. Third, good lane lines can
eliminate quite a bit of turbulence on the water’s surface.
Lane lines are extremely expensive, and for this reason, swimmers
are discouraged from hanging on them to rest or fix their goggles.
They are not designed to hold a swimmer’s weight, and if one
breaks, the quality of everyone’s workout suffers.

3.3
LINES ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL
Every pool designed for competition has black lines painted or set in
tile on the pool floor. These lines work like lane dividers on the road
and keep swimmers on course.
There is usually a “T” at both ends of each line, near the walls of
the pool. This “T” is a signal to the swimmer that the wall is
approaching and to prepare to finish or turn as the case may be.
On the wall of many pools, in alignment with the line on the bottom
of the pool, is a “+” designed to give swimmers a target for turning.
Some coaches discourage the use of this “+” because it encourages
swimmers to look forward, instead of down, compromising their
body position and slowing them down.
3.4
BACKSTROKE FLAGS
The colorful flags strung across the width of most pools about five
yards out from the wall are not just there for decoration. They are
backstroke flags, used to determine a swimmer’s distance from the
wall, and to prepare for the turn or finish.
Because the line on the bottom of the pool is not visible while the
swimmer is on his or her back, backstroke flags are essential for
swimming safely and swimming without slowing down to negotiate
the wall.
Backstroke flags are hung at the standard distance from the wall of
five yards at every competitive pool. By counting their strokes from
the point they pass under the flags, swimmers develop the ability to
finish and turn quickly without looking back at all. Backstroke flags
allow swimmers to practice their turn and finish in one pool and
have the same “count” in another pool.

POOL DEPTH MARKERS
Knowing how deep the water is that you are entering is a matter of
safety. Most pools are not uniform in depth. Depth markers are
usually printed on the edge of the pool or set in tile. Knowing the
depth of the water advises swimmers in advance where they can
stand up and where they can’t. It also tells swimmers if diving is safe
and appropriate, or if entering the water feet first is necessary.
Even experienced divers and swimmers who know how to do shallow
racing dives are discouraged from diving into the shallow end of
the pool. Diving accidents are the number one cause of permanent
injury at swimming pools, and you do not want to risk becoming
another statistic.
3.6
LIFEGUARDS
Many pools provide lifeguards during Masters workouts, as they do
for other water activities. Some Masters coaches are also certified
lifeguards. The primary job of lifeguards is to ensure safety, so
preventing injuries before they happen is their main concern.
This sometimes requires a lifeguard to intervene in swimming
activities. For instance, a lifeguard might help if a swimmer is about
to dive into shallow water, when someone is swimming the wrong
direction in the lane, or when a swimmer hangs on the lane lines.
The majority of lifeguards are younger than Masters swimmers.
Lifeguarding is a job that carries the most responsibility that a young
person can be hired to assume. Masters swimmers should remember
that even though the lifeguard may be “a kid,” it is important to
respect the rules they enforce. They are there for your safety.

Lane Etiquette
Lane etiquette is highly developed in most Masters workouts. It
allows more swimmers to swim together pleasantly and safely, in a
well-organized, well-moving environment. For some swimmers, the
lane etiquette of a Masters swimming workout is a major reason
they have chosen Master swimming over lap swim.
Lane etiquette encompasses rules for swimming and guidelines for
courteous behavior. Each team may have its own rules, so it is a
good idea to get to know them. In general, the considerations
include:
4.1
CHOOSING THE RIGHT LANE
Most Masters swimming workouts are organized into lanes where
swimmers of similar speed are grouped together. This allows each
lane to move smoothly with the least amount of slowing and
passing. Having swimmers of the same speed do the workout
together increases the quality and enjoyment of everyone’s
experience. Slower swimmers do not feel they are in the way, and
faster swimmers do not feel they are pressuring other swimmers.
Choosing the right lane may be difficult at first, but after a while, a
swimmer is able to gauge his or her speed and endurance and
determine the best place to swim. If you are unsure of which
group to swim in, ask the coach. If you choose a lane that turns out
to be too fast or too slow, be ready to move to another lane.
Remember, the goal is to keep each lane moving well, not to make
anyone feel unwelcome.
4.2
WHO GOES FIRST?
Some swimmers are leaders. Some swimmers are followers. If you
strive to lead your lane, you are striving to be the fastest, most
consistent swimmer in that lane. Leading a lane carries a lot of
responsibility with it. Lane leaders are expected to watch the clock
54

carefully. They are expected to count laps accurately. They are
expected to keep the lane moving at a speed that accommodates
everyone. If you are new to an established lane, it is courteous to
start at the back of the line and work your way forward, as your
swimming skills speak for themselves. If you become the leader and
finish consistently far in front of everyone, it might be time to move
to a faster lane.
4.3
CIRCLE SWIMMING
Circle swimming is the most common pattern of organization in
Masters swimming workouts. It allows the most people to swim in
one lane without bumping into each other. It requires that all
swimmers cooperate in swimming down on one side of the lane and
back on the other side. It is important to know if the circle pattern
starts on the left or the right before you begin swimming. Often, you
can determine this by observing the swimmers. If you are unsure,
asking your lane mates shows that you are aware of the circle swim
practice and that you want to make your joining of their lane
problem-free.
When circle swimming, details are important in keeping a smooth
running lane. These details include:
Following Distance
Know how many seconds each swimmer is supposed to wait before
starting to follow the swimmer in front of them. Commonly, swimmers
leave the wall five seconds apart. In certain situations, ten seconds
or more is set as the spacing. Ask what the custom is on your team,
then use the pace clock to be accurate.
Turning
Turns can be especially problematic in lanes with several swimmers,
because as swimmers swim close together, collisions are more likely
while one person is pushing off the wall and another swimmer is
approaching the wall.

Masters Swimming
Although the fastest turn is done straight in and straight out of the
wall, in the circle swimming environment, this is not an option.
Instead, swimmers approach the wall on their side of the lane, aim
at the “+” on the wall just before they turn, and then push
off diagonally in order to get over to the other side of the lane
most quickly.
Passing
Even if all swimmers in a lane are about the same speed, passing
becomes an issue especially during longer swims, as different levels
of endurance become apparent. There are times when the lead
swimmer may catch up to the last swimmer in the lane before the
swim is finished. For these situations, rules of passing should be
understood in advance by all swimmers in a lane.
Passing is not only the responsibility of faster swimmers. It must be
done in cooperation with slower swimmers. Some teams call for
passing only at the wall, when a slower swimmer stops for an
instant while a faster swimmer swims by. Some teams call for a
faster swimmer to signal a slower swimmer by tapping their feet, so
the slower swimmer can move over and let the faster swimmer go
by. Some teams call for a faster swimmer to change directions near
the end of the lane, going in front of a slower swimmer without
interruption. Knowing the passing customs of your team is important
to keep the lane moving as smoothly as possible and to avoid any
swimmer, slower or faster, becoming frustrated.
Collisions and Side Swipes
Sometimes, accidents happen. If you are involved in a collision or
side swipe, acknowledge what happened and ask if the other
swimmer is okay. This is courteous. There are situations when
collisions are most common. These include any activity on the back,
swimming, kicking or drilling. To avoid collisions when on the back,
swimming close to the lane line is a good idea. “Hugging” the lane
line will put the most space between you and another swimmer
coming toward you.
56

--- Page 57 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:31 Uhr Seite 57
Masters Swimming Readiness
There are also situations when side swipes are most common. These
include when swimmers are doing butterfly, kicking breaststroke, using
hand paddles, and when a swimmer has an especially wide freestyle
recovery. Being aware of other swimmers’ activities and whereabouts
can prevent many problems. A simple one-armed stroke, or at least a
purposeful narrow stroke, as you and another swimmer are passing by
each other can reduce side swipe situations dramatically.
4.4
WHEN YOU ARRIVE LATE
Although sometimes unavoidable, when you arrive late to workout,
it does cause an interruption to a lane already in progress. When
you arrive late, do not expect to do a standard warm-up in a lane
that has already completed its warm-up. You should simply join into
the activity that they are doing and attempt to make that your
warm-up. Do not interrupt the swimmers to get an explanation of
what they are doing. If it is not clear what they are doing, wait until
they stop for instructions, or ask the coach.
Be aware that the swimmers you are joining have already expended
a great deal of energy at the workout, and it is only courteous to not
take your swimming out very fast, as you are fresh, upsetting the
rhythm of the lane. Some Masters swimming workouts have a
designated warm-up lane, specifically for swimmers who arrive late.
This is not the case for most teams though.
4.5
WHEN YOU HAVE TO LEAVE EARLY
Sometimes, leaving before the end of a workout is unavoidable. Be
aware that your leaving does affect the way the lane works. When
you leave in the middle of a set, swimmers behind you suddenly get
less rest, as they are expected to move up in the order.
It is courteous to let your lane mates know in advance that you have
to leave early. Try to leave after a set has ended to avoid
interrupting your lane too much. Depart acknowledging with
admiration that your lane mates are staying for the whole workout.

Workout Jargon
“Okay, twenty fifties on the forty five, every fourth one fly. On the
top,” the coach says. What the heck does that mean? Swimming
jargon becomes easy to understand soon enough, but at first it
almost sounds like a different language.
The translation of what the coach said is: Swimmers are to swim 50
yards, which is two lengths of the pool in a 25-yard pool, twenty
times, leaving every 45 seconds on the pace clock, which includes
swim and rest time, doing freestyle, except for the forth, eighth,
twelfth, sixteenth and twentieth 50s, which are butterfly, and the first
swimmer is to start when the second hand reaches sixty.
It is clear from the length of this translation why swimming jargon
evolved. Common terms of swimming jargon include:
All out As fast as you can
Breath Control Abreathing pattern that is less frequent than usual
Descending Faster each time
Drill An activity designed to emphasize one aspect
of stroke technique.
50 Fifty yards/meters, or two lengths of a 25-yard pool,

Under the Sun
The healthy glow of an outdoor swimmer is unmistakable and awed
by many. But there are concerns for swimmers who regularly swim in
the sun. The amount of time spent in the sun by many swimmers is
both greater than recommended on a daily basis, and it is ongoing
over the long term, as they continue to train outdoors. In addition,
the sun’s effects are intensified by the water at the same time as the
swimmer is cooled by the water, giving a false impression of the
amount of sun that the swimmer is getting. Without precautions,
these issues present perfect conditions for sun damage. This
damage can be as benign as wrinkled skin, and as serious as skin
cancer or cataracts. Sun damage happens silently and gradually,
sometimes with very serious results.
The key to dealing with extensive daily and long-term effects of sun
exposure is prevention rather than damage control. Sunscreen is a
must for swimmers who workout outside. There are waterproof
varieties that will protect swimmers throughout their workout,
reducing damage to the skin from premature aging and decreasing
the real chance of developing skin cancer. The term skin cancer is
deceptive. While the initial stage of melanoma, a very serious form
of skin cancer, does emerge on the skin, giving a less serious
connotation than its true deadly potential, it is important to know
that the more advanced stages are invasive and can aggressively
spread to tissue, organs and bone.
The eyes of outdoor swimmers are also especially vulnerable to
damage. While historically appearing in later life, the incidence of
cataracts is on the rise in younger adults at an alarming rate. They
are occurring more and more frequently among outdoor swimmers,
especially among those with light-colored eyes. Cataracts form as
the lens in the eye gets cloudy, or dark, and vision is diminished,
sometimes to the point of near blindness. This condition can be
corrected surgically by removing the damaged lens and implanting a
synthetic one. However, vision is not as good as it was before the
cataracts developed. Avoiding exposure and risk of cataracts can be
achieved by simply wearing dark tinted goggles with UV protection.

Coaches on the pool deck should also take precautions. Sunscreen,
sunglasses and a brimmed hat should all be a part of their deck
wear. The glare and reflective nature of the water can intensify the
effects of the sun as much as if a person is in the water. Swimmers
and coaches who spend regular periods of time in the sun can enjoy
its positive effects, without suffering its negative consequences,
when the proper care is taken in advance and practiced consistently.

Staying Fit to Swim
In general, swimming is easier on the body than most other sports. The
low impact nature of swimming, combined with the reduced gravity
environment, and the gentle resistance effect of the water make
swimming statistically one of the lowest injury producing sports of all.
Swimming is one of the few exercise routines that people can
continue as long as they live, long after other athletic activities
become impossible. In fact some swimmers, who have reached the
point where walking is difficult, use a cane or walker to get to the
edge of the pool, then once in the water, find the ease and efficiency
of motion that they are no longer able to experience on land.
Swimming is recognized as the best fitness activity for individuals
with health limitations. It is frequently prescribed as therapy for
conditions including arthritis, asthma and severe obesity. It is
recommended as rehabilitation following back, hip and knee surgery.
The positive effects of swimming greatly outweigh the risks.
However, there are some injuries and conditions that do show up
among swimmers. It is important to note that not all of them are
caused by swimming, but instead are sometimes existing conditions

Coaches on the pool deck should also take precautions. Sunscreen,
sunglasses and a brimmed hat should all be a part of their deck
wear. The glare and reflective nature of the water can intensify the
effects of the sun as much as if a person is in the water. Swimmers
and coaches who spend regular periods of time in the sun can enjoy
its positive effects, without suffering its negative consequences,
when the proper care is taken in advance and practiced consistently.

In general, swimming is easier on the body than most other sports. The
low impact nature of swimming, combined with the reduced gravity
environment, and the gentle resistance effect of the water make
swimming statistically one of the lowest injury producing sports of all.
Swimming is one of the few exercise routines that people can
continue as long as they live, long after other athletic activities
become impossible. In fact some swimmers, who have reached the
point where walking is difficult, use a cane or walker to get to the
edge of the pool, then once in the water, find the ease and efficiency
of motion that they are no longer able to experience on land.
Swimming is recognized as the best fitness activity for individuals
with health limitations. It is frequently prescribed as therapy for
conditions including arthritis, asthma and Severe obesity. It is
recommended as rehabilitation following back, hip and knee surgery.
The positive effects of swimming greatly outweigh the risks.

However, there are some injuries and conditions that do show up
among swimmers. It is important to note that not all of them are
caused by swimming, but instead are sometimes existing conditions
that are aggravated by swimming. Just the same, the key to
preventing swimming-related injuries and worsening existing

7.1
UNDERSTANDING PAIN
People have different perceptions of physical pain. People’s
experience with pain also differs. Most people have experienced the
pain of a headache, a toothache, or a minor burn. Some people have
experienced the pain of a broken bone or a kidney stone. Despite
our differences in perception and experience with physical pain, we
understand it as a sign that something is wrong.
There are a few exceptions to the rule that pain means something is
wrong. Childbirth, for instance has pain with it, but the result of this
pain is positive: the birth of a baby. In most people’s minds,
athletics is another exception to this rule. In athletics, it is commonly
accepted that a certain amount of pain is necessary to excel. Most of
us grew up admiring athletes who had trained their bodies to a level
that the average person could not reach. The very best athletes were
seen as the ones who had the highest threshold for pain. They were
able to work harder and become better than the average person who
succumbed to the pain of pushing their bodies in higher athletic pursuit.
In reality though, athletic pain is more complex than many people
realize. In fact, athletic pain must be understood as two distinct
kinds of pain. Recognizing the difference is an essential part of being
an athlete who continues to advance his or her performance, while
remaining injury free.
The first kind of athletic pain is what most of us think of when we
imagine what an accomplished athlete has gone through to attain
his or her level of performance. It could be described as the
sensation of being outside our comfort zone. We breathe hard, our
heart beats fast, our muscles burn. Being able to endure this sort of
discomfort, or pain associated with conditioning, is not harmful to a
certain degree. It is “Okay Pain.”
The second kind of pain is very important to distinguish from the
first because it is an alarm that something is wrong. This kind of
pain could be described as sharp or nagging. A distinct pain in a
specific area of the body may occur when we do a certain action.
62

Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:32 Uhr Seite 63

The pain may persist long after a workout. This is “Not Okay Pain.” It
should not be ignored. Willpower should not be used to endure it!
“Swimming through” this kind of pain can result in a real injury that
can keep a swimmer out of the pool for an extended period of time.
If you experience “Not Okay Pain” while swimming, you should take
action right away:
• Pinpoint the site of the pain in your body.
• Determine if there is any specific movement
that makes it worse
• Tell these things to your coach immediately
• Modify your swimming to rest the affected area
• Take a day or two off if the pain persists
7.2
WHAT IS YOUR PAIN TELLING YOU?
Pain occurs most commonly in certain parts of swimmers’ bodies,
including the shoulders, knees and back. It is important for
swimmers to understand what some of the possible causes for their
pain are, to pay attention to it, and take appropriate action.
Shoulder Pain
SHOULDER INSTABILLITY
Shoulder instability is recognized as the single most important factor
in causing pain and athletic injury to swimmers. The construction of
the shoulder joint makes it very vulnerable in repetitive use sports,
like swimming. The shoulder joint is shaped sort of like a golf tee,
where it meets the bone of the upper arm. The bones do not lock
together to stay in place. They are merely held in place by four small
muscles surrounding the shoulder joint, called the rotator cuff, under
the visible deltoid muscle of the shoulder.
Because swimmers tend to develop short muscles in their chest and
long muscles in their back, the rotator cuff muscles around the
shoulder joint can develop unevenly. When this happens, the bones
are not held securely in place. The upper arm bone can fall slightly

out of place, or worse, can move around at the shoulder joint,
resulting in an unstable shoulder. Shoulder instability can lead to
numerous other shoulder conditions, including bursitis and
impingement syndrome, that should be recognized as symptoms of
shoulder instability and treated accordingly. Shoulder instability in
swimmers can be improved with specific exercises designed to
strengthen the rotator cuff muscles. Many swimmers do these
DRY LAND
TRAINING exercises routinely, even if shoulder pain is not a problem, as
a preventive measure.
BURSITIS
Bursitis is the inflammation of the sack of fluid, called the bursa,
which provides a cushion between the bones of the shoulder joint. It
causes pain and soreness when the shoulder is used. Unfortunately,
the pain of bursitis seems to be something that many swimmers can
endure, leading them to “swim through it.” Bursitis can be alleviated
in a relatively short time if it is treated early with rest and ice.
If ignored, it can become a chronic problem, which just gets worse.
DRY LAND When the pain of bursitis subsides, attention should be turned to
TRAINING strengthening the rotator cuff to help prevent further another bout
of bursitis.
IMPINGEMENT SYNDROME
Impingement Syndrome refers to the painful condition caused when
the supraspinatus muscle that runs over the top of the shoulder is
pinched between the bone of the upper arm and the point of the
shoulder. This happens when the tissues around the shoulder joint
are inflamed, preventing the muscle from moving smoothly between
the bones as the arm is lifted. It is also aggravated by posture that
allows the shoulders to drop toward the chest. Actively working to
correct this posture problem, known as “swimmer’s posture,” by
holding the shoulders back and moving the shoulder blades closer
together in the back can sometimes help alleviate the pain of early
shoulder impingement and help avoid further problems.

Knee Pain
MENISCUS DETERIORATION
The meniscus is the layer of cartilage that cushions the lower leg
bones from the upper leg bone at the knee. Over a lifetime, this layer
of cartilage can become thin, causing more impact between the upper
and lower leg bones, which can be painful. The meniscus can also
become frayed, causing irritation with movement, similar to a hang
nail. Minor meniscal deterioration can cause on-again and off-again
pain, that seems to appear and disappear for no apparent reason.
Actual tears of the meniscus, or injuries where the meniscus
becomes detached, are more common among land athletes, as there
is more impact, twisting and pressure at the knee under the force of
gravity, than in water. Still, the pain can manifest itself in the pool.
Atorn or detached meniscus may need to be corrected surgically.

WEAK HAMSTRINGS
Some knee pain is the result of underdeveloped muscles in the back
of your upper leg, called hamstrings. This is seen most commonly in
people beginning a program of running. This sort of knee pain is
actually a protective mechanism of the body, to prevent the person
from further activity that the leg muscles are not strong enough to
do. The knees swell and activity becomes difficult and very painful.
Swimmers who have just taken up running may feel this knee pain in
the pool, as well. With rest, the swelling and pain subside, and
activity can be resumed, starting very slowly and building up
gradually. If ignored, this can be a chronic condition that will just get
worse.
LIGAMENT DAMAGE
The upper and lower bones of the leg are joined at the knee by four
ligaments that support the directional movement and leverage
required of the legs. Strains and tears to the ligaments of the knee
are common among land athletes but are rarely caused by
swimming. Still, swimming activities can aggravate the pain of
ligament damage. Modified swimming activities can sometimes be
successful in avoiding pain, but stability to injured knee ligaments
can only be fully restored with surgery.

Back Pain
MUSKEL SPASMS
Muscle spasms of the lower back can cause debilitating pain. They
often come without warning and can be relentless in their severity.
Sometimes the pain is so severe, a person may go to the emergency
room thinking something is wrong with one of their internal organs.
Back spasms can occur as a result of a simple turn, lift or movement
that a person has done before with no ill effects. The key to avoiding
muscle spasms is to have well-developed muscles in both the back
and the front of the body. This allows for a distribution of the work
the body is being asked to do and lessens the chance that a single
muscle will become strained by carrying an undue load.
For swimmers, the actions most frequently associated with muscle
spasms in the back are butterfly and dolphin kick. Since the butterfly
takes a great deal of strength and endurance to sustain, it is
common for a swimmer’s technique and timing to suffer if a lot of
butterfly is done. Incorrect butterfly technique and timing can result
in a great deal of strain on the back.
Pull buoys also can stress the muscles of the back by holding a
swimmer’s hips too high, resulting in a curved back. The muscles of
the back strain as the swimmer attempts to straighten his or her
posture against the pressure of the pull buoy. Using a smaller pull
buoy can sometimes help. Some swimmers pull without a pull buoy,
which is fine if the correct floatation can be maintained, otherwise
avoiding pulling is a good idea. Strengthening the abdominal
muscles to distribute the load is an excellent way to prevent back
strain and painful muscle spasms.
DISK DEGENERATION
The bones of the spine, called vertebrae, have built-in shock
absorbers between them, called disks. Natural degeneration and
injury can cause these disks to bulge, rupture or slip and press
against the many nerves around the spine. The pain associated with
disk degeneration is chronic, and can become acute. The pain can
affect the back and extend down the legs. It can sometimes only be
alleviated by surgery to repair a damaged disk. Short of this drastic
67

Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:32 Uhr Seite 68
Masters Swimming
measure, doctors often recommend that patients with disk problems
try to remain as active as possible. Swimming is frequently
recommended because the pain of the condition is often alleviated
by the reduced gravity environment of the water.
THIGHT HAMSTRINGS
Athletes with over-developed hamstring muscles sometimes suffer
from back pain as the uneven muscle structure in their legs affects
their posture and the way their trunk distributes a load. This
phenomenon is frequently seen in runners who swim. Careful attention
should be paid to the kicking technique of these individuals, as the
tendency is to incorrectly power the kick with the hamstring muscles
rather than the quadriceps in the front of the leg. Doing so will
encourage ineffective kicking and worsen their back pain. A careful
program of stretching is sometimes helpful for these individuals.

attack occurs, air flow is restricted due to the narrowing of the
bronchial passages. The asthmatic may wheeze and cough in an
attempt to restore normal breathing.
Some asthmatics are able to manage their condition through
medication and by avoiding allergens. Doctors who encourage their

Arthritis is a painful condition that affects the joints causing
stiffness, swelling, reduced range of motion and, in more advanced
stages, weakness and deformity. Arthritis can affect the shoulders,
elbows, wrists, fingers, hips, knees, and ankles among other joints
and surrounding tissues.
There are many kinds of arthritis, and although the cause is
unknown, many underlying conditions are associated with its onset,
including injury, illness, and age. Many arthritis sufferers have found
that some swimming actually alleviates their pain, as the mild
compression effect of the water can reduce swelling and make

MENOPAUSE
Menopause, or the time when ovulation stops, brings with it many
physical and psychological changes to the lives of women. Although
the average age to begin menopause is 51, many women experience
symptoms as early as their 30s. Symptoms vary widely in frequency
and severity. Physical symptoms can include hot flashes, weight
gain, vaginal dryness and night sweats. Psychological symptoms can
include depression, irritability, moodiness, loss of interest in sex,
and inability to sleep. Psychological symptoms are attributed to
diminishing estrogen levels consistent with menopause.
Although traditional treatments for menopausal symptoms include
hormone replacement treatments, recent studies have uncovered
risks associated with these therapies, including an increased chance
of breast cancer and cardiovascular problems.
Many doctors are now recommending that women seeking relief
from the symptoms of menopause take up a regular fitness routine.
Researchers continue to show that exercise works as a mood
elevator and as a hormone regulator. Many menopausal women who
engage in regular exercise, such as Masters swimming, find their
symptoms become less severe.

OSTEOPOROSIS
Osteoporosis, or the thinning of the bones, is a part of the aging
process and present to some degree in all people of advanced age.
However, it is most common in post-menopausal women, petite
women, individuals who have had poor nutrition over many years, or
those who have been inactive for a prolonged period of time.
Medical tests can determine if osteoporosis is present and to what
degree. At its early stages, the progression of osteoporosis can be
slowed with the help of exercise, which includes swimming in
combination with weight-bearing activities.
Because swimming does not involve much weight-bearing activity,
aside from pushing off the wall, other forms of exercise should be
done that require the bones to bear weight. Walking is one of best
ways to fend off osteoporosis. Still, swimming is often recommended
as an activity for people with mild to moderate osteoporosis,
because it provides the opportunity for a high degree of physical
activity with a low risk of breaking fragile bones.
8.5
PREGNANCY
Pregnancy is by no means an illness, but nonetheless should be
considered a limiting health condition when swimming. The physical
demands of pregnancy, as well as the dramatic changes a woman’s body
goes through over a nine-month period require swimming activities to
be modified as the pregnancy progresses. In conjunction with regular
prenatal care, a pregnant swimmer can safely enjoy swimming
throughout her term and benefit from continuing the activity.
The weightless environment of the water is the most comfortable
place for many pregnant women to be! Swimming for exercise is also
an excellent way to prepare for the strength and endurance required
during labor. During each work out, the heart rate should be
monitored several times. Most doctors recommend that a
pregnant swimmer’s activity should not make the heart rate exceed
120 beats per minute.

1 The Basics of Swimming
Performance
Swimming performance is a
complex sphere of numerous
interlaced factors. At its most
basic level, good swimming is
best achieved by working at it
from two sides: stroke
mechanics, or technique, and
physical fitness, or conditioning
(Figure 3.1). Working toward
good swimming from only one
side will create improvement,
but only to a certain extent.
Figure 3.1
Swimmers can spend years working to improve their strokes by
correcting and refining them, striving for the perfect stroke, but
without a certain amount of conditioning work, they will not have the
strength and endurance to sustain the stroke they have perfected for
any distance. Likewise, swimmers can spend years working out,
training with hard sets, improving their endurance and cardiovascular
capabilities day after day, but without good stroke technique, they
will not have the efficiency to make that conditioning work for them
and achieve the most results. For this reason, good swimming is a
matter that must be approached from two sides simultaneously.
Swimmers should reach for their best swimming by working on their
technique and conditioning. By doing so, swimmers will develop
solid, efficient strokes and develop the ability to use those
strokes over extended periods of swimming, making their workout
time more productive and their improvement occur more rapidly.

2 The Fundamentals
of Stroke Technique
Good stroke technique is necessary for good swimming. But what
exactly does “good stroke technique” mean? Does it mean that
excellent swimmers all swim exactly the same way? No. In fact, if you
watched ten champions, swimming side by side, each swimmer’s
stroke would look different in many ways. So, what makes good
stroke technique?
Basically, it is a matter of efficient forward motion. In comparing the
strokes of those ten champions again, although each person’s stroke
is unique, there are fundamental ways in which they are the same.
To achieve efficient forward motion, there are three skills that good
swimmers all do well:
1.MINIMIZE DRAG
Minimizing drag means moving through the water
with as little disruption as possible to that water. It
means being aware of one’s space in the water and
working to make that profile smooth and compact. It
means swimming like a fish swims, very streamlined
and without much splashing (Figure 3.2). It means
trying to slide forward through the water, instead of
moving the water out of the way.
Figure 3.2 Minimize Drag
2.FEEL THE WATER
Feeling the water means that the swimmer learns to treat it as if it
was more like a solid thing, rather than like air. It means using the
water like a handle, as if the swimmer was rock climbing
horizontally, advancing past that handle with each stroke (Figure
3.3). It means holding on to the water to create forward motion.

3.ACCESS POTENTIAL POWER
Accessing potential power means that the
swimmer uses the largest muscle groups
available to accomplish forward motion,
those being in the core, in combination
with the muscles of the limbs (Figure 3.4).
It means using the body’s natural leverage
to get the most out of each movement. It
means that the swimmer learns to position
his or her body and limbs most
advantageously so that all available energy

Analyzing Swimming
Technique
While the specific form of each of the four competitive swimming
strokes is different, there are common parts to each stroke, and the
bottom line is that good stroke technique, or efficient swimming,
requires the coordination or correct timing of all these parts:
3.1
BODY POSITION
The importance of body position in the water cannot be overstated.
Body position, or how a swimmer lays on the water, affects his or
her ability to achieve a streamlined path through the water, or swim
instead unhindered by drag. A swimmer with poor body position will
work much harder than a swimmer with a better floating position.
Body position affects the quality of the catch, or anchoring of the
hands in the water. If a swimmer floats “uphill,” with his feet much
lower than his head, the catch will have to be used to correct
floatation rather than to advance forward. Also, body position affects
how much leverage is available to use, and therefore how much
potential power can be accessed. Spending time developing good
body position in the water is one of the very first steps to becoming
a better swimmer.
3.2
ARM STROKE
The arm stroke can be looked at in three parts. First, the entry and
catch, which extends and anchors the hands in the water, provides the
swimmer with a point to advance beyond. Without a good catch, or
ability to anchor the hands in the water, the rest of the arm stroke
cannot produce effective forward motion. It is important to remember
that the goal is to plant the hand in the water and move the body
past that point, not to simply churn the arms through the water.
Second, there is the path of the pull, which encompasses the whole
underwater portion of the stroke, through the point where the hand
releases the water. During this phase of the stroke, some swimmers
describe feeling a “pull,” and then a “push,” as their hand presses
78

--- Page 79 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:33 Uhr Seite 79
Working Out
on the water. The “pull” is felt when the hand is in front of the
shoulder, and then becomes a “push” as the hand passes by the
shoulder towards the finish of the stroke. In trying to find this “pull”
and “push,” it is important to remember that it is really not just the
arm that is “pulling” and “pushing,” but it is the leverage from the
core that must be employed to make this happen more effectively.
Finally, the third part of the stroke is the recovery, when the arm
returns to the front for another stroke. The recovery should be
relaxed but swift. It is the only phase of the stroke when the arms rest,
so it is important to be able to generate the power for the recovery
through leverage from the core.
3.3
KICK
The leg action in swimming serves several purposes. It provides a sort
of rear motor that aids in momentum. It provides a balancing effect to
the upper body motion. And it provides rhythm to the stroke. An
effective kick can make a real difference in the quality of a
swimmer’s stroke productivity. Some people think that the kick
should be used to keep the legs from sinking. Using the kick in this
way takes more energy than it is worth and makes the other
purposes of the kick secondary. The kick should help the swimmer
go forward, not up.
3.4
BREATHING
In swimming, the act of timing one’s inhalation and exhalation to the
timing of the face being in or out of the water, and doing so without
hindering the progress of the stroke, is a challenge that is not a part
of other sports. In addition, in all strokes, the exhalation must be
timed to the power phase of the stroke, and the inhalation timed to
the recovery phase of the stroke for the most beneficial results. The
most effective breathing in swimming is done by inhaling through
the mouth and exhaling through the mouth and nose. This allows
the most efficient exchange of new and old air, while preventing the
uncomfortable feeling of water getting into the sinuses.
In the following sections, we will analyze each stroke in terms of its
parts and then address the coordination of those parts. At the end of
each stroke section is a “Troubleshooting” section designed to help
solve common technique problems.

The Strokes
4.1
FREESTYLE
It is a common assertion that freestyle is the easiest stroke. Certainly,
freestyle is the stroke that swimmers use most. It is not uncommon
for a workout to be 80% or more freestyle. We warm up and cool
down with freestyle. We use freestyle to time gauge our progress in
distances from 50 yards to a mile or more. And because it is the
stroke that most swimmers can go fastest with over a long distance,
freestyle is what we use for open water swimming and for the swim
leg of triathlons.
Historically, freestyle has been taught with the focus on what it looks
like on top of the water. Special attention was given to elbow bend
during recovery, the waterline at the head, and the amount of splash
made by the kick. Today, coaches analyze freestyle in terms of what
is going on under the water. It is now generally agreed that freestyle
is the fastest stroke because it uses leverage most suited to the
strength and balance of the human body. Although the underwater
arm stroke is similar to that of butterfly, in the freestyle the arms
alternate, allowing the stroke to produce continuous momentum,
80

--- Page 81 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:33 Uhr Seite 81
Working Out
making forward motion less strenuous than in the butterfly. And
although the alternating arm motion of freestyle is similar to
backstroke, in freestyle the arm stroke pulls underneath the body,
which is a stronger pull position than the backstroke’s pull down the
side of the body.
With so many yards done in freestyle, many swimmers have
developed the habit of swimming the stroke on “automatic pilot.”
And, while most swimmers have developed a highly conditioned
freestyle, allowing this “cruise control” to work fairly well, freestyle
technique is not given nearly as much attention as it should be,
given how much the stroke is utilized. A common complaint about
freestyle, more than any other stroke, is shoulder tightness and
shoulder pain. “Freestyle shoulders” are most often attributed to
overuse, and the solution given to many swimmers is to cut back, or
even stop swimming. But looking more carefully, many cases of
“freestyle shoulders” have another cause. Frequently, they stem from
minor technique problems that are repeated over and over as
swimmers use freestyle as the staple of their workouts. For this
reason, freestyle technique should be a top and constant priority.
Body Position
Although at first glance it appears that the freestyle stroke is
performed in a front floating position (thus the official name of the
stroke, “front crawl”), this is a fundamental misunderstanding of the
stroke. In fact, although the swimmer should look down at the
bottom of the pool in freestyle, allowing the head to float in a neutral
position, the rest of the body does not lie flat in the water at anytime
during the stroke. The true floating position in freestyle is balancing
on the armpit and the point of the hip bone (Figure 3.6).
This has been described by some as “swimming on your side,” but
this description is a bit misleading. Actually lying on your side in the
water is as disadvantageous as lying flat. There is no leverage to
speak of in either position. The correct position is in the middle of the
two. This balance or float position is one extreme of the pendulum-
like motion that the body makes in freestyle, from one armpit and hip
to the other armpit and hip, never resting in the middle.

When a swimmer achieves the
armpit-hip balance, it is very
similar to the position a baseball
batter takes before hitting the ball.
It is also similar to a golfer just
before he or she swings. Even a
boxer finds this position when
preparing to punch. For the human
body, this is a position of strength,
which gives most access for the
next action to be powered by the
core. For swimmers, that next
action is to vault past the point

in freestyle. The other half is that the swimmer must find a constant

it as the center point of

Arm Stroke
The freestyle arm stroke has traditionally been taught as an “S”
shaped pull. But presenting the arm stroke in this manner has often
led swimmers to disassociate the pull from the core action, as they
trace an “S” in the water with their hand when they swim. Perhaps a
more precise description of what should occur is that as the body rolls
from one extreme to the other, the path of the pull sweeps outward,
inward, and then outward again, like an extended “S” (Figure 3.8).
The fundamental
distinction is that
the path of the pull
is a function of the
body roll, not an
independent action.
Figure 3.8 Path of Freestyle Arms Underwater
The arm stroke is made up of three parts: the extension and catch,
the pull and release, and the recovery. The arm is able to reach full
extension as the armpit and hip
on the same side are at
their lowest point, giving the
swimmer the best position to
make the “catch” by anchoring
the forward reaching hand in
the water. At this point,
the extended hand should be
aligned with, or even slightly
outside the line of the
armpit and hip (Figure 3.9).
Simultaneously, the other arm is

to release the water around

the hip, as that side of the
body rises to its highest point.

After the catch, the hand remains
firmly anchored as the body
advances forward. It is important
here not to allow this long lever
to lose power by collapsing

(Figure 3.10). The elbow must

unique to every freestyler. While

Correct The fundamental similarity in the

that they are relaxed. The recovery

Working Out
Kick
Freestyle uses the flutter kick, an alternating kick that is unique to
humans. While flutter kick can be extremely powerful, it also uses a
disproportionate amount of the available energy a swimmer has, in
light of how much forward motion it produces. It is commonly agreed
that the kick in freestyle is only responsible for about 10 to 15 percent
of a swimmer’s speed, slightly more for sprinters. However, the kick in
freestyle is still an essential part of the stroke because it provides
lateral balance to the pendulum motion of the stroke, rhythm, as well
as leverage to aide the firm anchoring of the hands in front.
Flutter kick is used in freestyle in a variety of rhythms. The most
common rhythm is the 6-beat kick, which means that a swimmer
kicks six times during each arm cycle of both arms. Other swimmers
use four kicks per arm cycle. Some use 2 kicks per arm cycle, one
kick per side of the pendulum, which often resembles a one legged
dolphin kick. Still others use five or seven kicks per arm cycle, kicking
more with one side of the pendulum than the other. Odd number
kicking patterns are indicative of an asymmetrical stroke, which is not
that uncommon in freestyle. The number of kicks per stroke that a
swimmer does is often a function of the distance he or she is
swimming. Generally, a quicker kicking rhythm, which produces more
kicks, is used in sprinting, and a slower kicking rhythm, which
produces fewer kicks, is used in longer distance swimming.
The flutter kick should be generated by the largest muscles in the
leg, those in the thigh. In a whiplike motion, one leg drives
downward, in a fluid motion, as if it had no bones. The foot is
pointed, and slightly pigeon-toed, but also relaxed in order to get as
much “flipper effect” as humanly possible. The depth of the kick
should remain within the swimmer’s profile. As one leg reaches its
maximum depth, the other rises to the surface in a relaxed but
straight position. The whole foot does not need to break the surface
of the water for an effective kick. For most good kickers, the heel
may break the surface, but the foot remains attached to the water.
The splash that is present with the kick of fast freestylers is the
result of water being displaced from underneath and moved quickly
to the surface, rather than the result of the foot coming down from
the air and making a hole in the water.

Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:33 Uhr Seite 86
Masters Swimming
Breathing
Breathing must be an integral part of the stroke or it can break the
leverage and rhythm of the freestyle. It must therefore be considered
to be a function of the pendulum effect of the core, not an
independent action. Breathing is done to the side, within the roll of
the stroke. It is the only time the swimmer is not looking at the
bottom of the pool.
Rather than turning his or her chin dramatically to get a breath, the
swimmer’s head follows the body’s roll, for that stroke, to the point
that the mouth has enough clearance to take in new air. If breathing
to the right, the left temple, cheek and jawbone should remain in the
water when inhaling. If breathing to the left, the right side of the
face remains in the water. In either case, the chin remains aligned
with the breastbone throughout the roll up and roll down of the
breathing.
There is no one correct breathing pattern. Many swimmers breathe
every other stroke, always on the same side. Many swimmers
breathe on alternate sides, every three strokes. Alternate breathing
is considered a good way to encourage a very symmetrical roll.
Some swimmers breathe every four, every six or more strokes.
Infrequent breathing is most commonly seen in freestyle sprinting
since it is sustainable only for a short time.
Coordination
Coordinating the arms, the legs and the breathing to work with the
body roll is essential for an efficient, sustainable, and shoulder-
saving freestyle. In freestyle, the arm action is not uniform in speed.
More time is spent with the arms toward the front, creating a sort of
“catch up” timing. Although there is a point in the stroke where the
arms are opposite, the recovering arm catches up with the anchoring
86

--- Page 87 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:33 Uhr Seite 87
Working Out
arm in the later part of the stroke, and the recovery is quicker than
the initial stage of the stroke.
The timing of the breathing to the arms should be focused on during
both the inhalation and the exhalation. The inhalation to the side
should occur when opposite side hand extends in front. If the
inhalation occurs later than this, there is a temptation to press down
on the water to get your face clear to breathe. It is important to
continue the forward line of the stroke while breathing by reaching
forward, not down (Figure 3.12). The exhalation should be timed to
begin with the anchoring of the other arm and continue to the end
of the pull.
The timing of the kick varies by the number of kicks a swimmer does
with each arm cycle. However, a dominant kick should be timed to
happen simultaneously with the arm extension and catch for the
best coordination.

BACKSTROKE
It is safe to say that backstroke is the least popular stroke. There are
many reasons swimmers cite for not enjoying backstroke. Most
commonly, swimmers say that it makes them nervous to swim
upside down without being able to see where they are going. There
is a lot to bump into in a pool, after all! Further, swimmers don’t like
water in their nose. Nose clips are more frequently used by
swimmers doing backstroke than any other stroke. Lastly, backstroke
makes a lot of swimmers tired. Backstroke seems to take more effort
than the other strokes do because the power phase of the kick is
done in an upward direction, against gravity.
For the most part, backstroke is a very misunderstood stroke.
Common myths about backstroke include: that it uses a windmill
type arm action, that you need to arch your back to do backstroke,
that the back of your head stays out of the water, that you kick the
water downward for the most power, and that only one arm moves
at a time. Each of these myths contributes to its own technique
problem to one degree or another. Whether it is because many
swimmers are self-taught backstrokers, simulating what they have
seen other swimmers do, or because they have just been taught
incorrectly, misconceptions about backstroke are very common.

They are the root of backstroke dislike, and can even lead to
shoulder problems, if not addressed early. Done right, backstroke
can be a very relaxing, balanced stroke, which gives swimmers a
welcome break from looking at the bottom of the pool.
Body Position
The correct floating
position for backstroke is
with the face above the
water, but the ears under Correct
the water, and the hips
held near the surface by a
tight core and a straight
spine. To access core
strength in backstroke, it
is necessary to keep the
spine as straight as Incorrect
possible. This is contrary
to the common urge to
arch the back in order to
correct floating problems,
in an attempt to stay on Incorrect
the surface (Figure 3.13).
Figure 3.13 Backstroke Posture
By arching the back, a swimmer’s face usually ends up submerged to
some extent, and the feet are low in the water. The direction that the
swimmer then aims becomes downward rather than forward.
Keeping the spine as straight as possible aligns the motion forward.
It also gives swimmers an axis to swim from and a good fulcrum for
the lever of their core.
A swimmer can practice this alignment by standing with his or her
back to a wall and working to press every part of the spine into the
wall, from the head to the hips. Notice that when this is
accomplished, the abdominal muscles are slightly contracted, and

the pelvis is tilted forward a bit,
holding the position firm.
The leverage in backstroke,
comes from a rolling action,
where the body turns on the firm
axis of the spine from side to
side, supplying power to the arm
stroke. (Figure 3.14) Without
this rolling action, the potential
power of the stroke is dramatically
reduced.
Figure 3.14 Backstroke Roll
Arm Stroke
Backstroke is known as an opposition stroke, which means that
when one arm is up, the other is down, and when one arm is in the
water, the other is out. Both arms move continuously. Some
swimmers understand this as a windmill action, which is true only in
part. It is also only partly true that the
backstroke arms are always opposite.
To clarify: the backstroker’s hand enters
the water, pinkie first over the head, in
line with the shoulder (Figure 3.15),
and anchors it just below the surface
about the same depth as the width
from breastbone to shoulder. It is at
the point, that the other arm exits

the water, the hand near the thigh.
Figure 3.15 Backstroke Hand Entry
So, there is an instant when both hands are in the water, one over
the head and the other at the side...not quite opposite. The path of
the anchored arm is along the side of the body (Figure 3.16), elbow
bent but firm, as if throwing a ball at your feet, not below the body’s

profile in a circular or windmill motion at all (Figure 3.17). As the
anchored arm is pulling, the other arm is recovering in a straight arm
motion, which does resemble a windmill, elbow locked, and hands
pitched outward at the wrist. At the middle point of the recovery, the
arms are truly opposite of each other but are not a mirror image of
each other. The rolling action of the body is crucial in developing an
effective arm stroke. Without a roll, the hand cannot anchor properly,
and the available leverage cannot be accessed. In addition, without
rolling, the other hand cannot exit the water without creating quite a
bit of drag. Because the arm stroke ends below the surface of the
water, it is necessary to roll the hip up, to bring the arm near the
thigh back up to the surface to begin the recovery properly. At the
midpoint of the recovery, when the arm is exactly perpendicular to
the body, the entire armpit of that arm should be out of the water.
Likewise, the armpit of the other arm should be at its deepest point.

Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:33 Uhr Seite 94
Masters Swimming
Kick
Like freestyle, the backstroke uses the flutter kick, which works in an
alternating fashion, so that when one foot reaches the top of the
motion, the other is at its deepest point.
Good backstrokers have extremely flexible ankles and can easily
point their toes, creating a straight line from the knee to the big toe.
Some swimmers can do this easier than others. But one thing all
swimmers can do is to position their feet in a pigeon-toed position.
Like very pointed toes, this position produces more foot surface with
which to kick the water.
In backstroke, the main thrust of the kick should be an upward
motion (Figure 3.18). The heel should be dropped down below the
surface of the water but still be within the profile of the stroke.
Then the top of the foot should be forced upward quickly, as if trying
to kick a ball floating on the surface of the water. This kind of
kick should create a boiling
effect on the water’s surface,
which happens as the foot
moves deep water rapidly toward
the surface. This boil, or splash, Correct
is created even without the foot
breaking the water’s surface.
It is important to remember
that the knees, too, should not
Incorrect
break the surface in backstroke,
or the kick will produce more
drag than forward motion. To
maintain a streamlined position
while kicking, avoid bending at Incorrect
the hips to kick and lifting the
knees as if bicycling or marching.

Working Out
Breathing
Most people discount breathing as an issue in backstroke because
the swimmer’s face is out of the water. In fact, breathing is very
important to maintaining the rhythm of the stroke. The most
common breathing pattern is to choose an inhalation arm, and an
exhalation arm. When the armpit of the inhalation arm is at its
highest, it creates a sort of barrier to the water. This is the time to
inhale. Then, when the exhalation arm is pulling, exhale completely.
It is very important not to hold your breath in backstroke, although
it is tempting. The exchange of old air for new air is essential in
being able to perform the stroke over any distance. This is true for
any physical activity. For example, how long would you last running
if you held your breath?
Coordination
Most good backstrokers use about six kicks for every complete arm
cycle, that is both arms going around once. That means the legs are
moving about three times as fast as the arms. The head remains still
on its axis while the arms turn, powered by the core that is rolling
into and out of each stroke.
The kick is best coordinated by timing the power phase, or upbeat of
a dominant kick to the moment that the hand is anchored, in an
“X”-type balance: left arm anchoring when the right foot is kicking up.
Many good backstokers believe that the key to good backstroke is
fitting the stroke into the breathing rhythm, rather than fitting
the breathing into the stroke rhythm. Maintaining an even and
relaxed breathing rhythm gives the stroke a good sustainable cadence.

BUTTERFLY
Done right, the butterfly is an awesome sight that blends immense
power, rhythm and grace. The newest of the four competitive
strokes, the butterfly, was developed in the 1940s, as swimmers
experimented with how to make the breaststroke faster. Originally, it
was called the dolphin breaststroke. In fact, in Masters swimming,
using a butterfly arm stroke with a breaststroke kick is still legal,
although for most swimmers, it is not the fastest alternative. The
butterfly stroke was finally included in the rulebook as an official
stroke, in its own right, in the 1950s. Because of its relatively new
status, evolution in butterfly technique is ongoing. The butterfly we
have watched Olympians do, and that many of us learned as
youth swimmers, with it’s “keyhole” pull and arm stroke pulling
down to the hips, has evolved into an even more powerful stroke.
Today, swimmers are taught the “Y” butterfly, which, although similar
to the traditional butterfly in many ways, takes much of the
emphasis off the arm stroke and places it more on the core.
Swimmers just learning the butterfly have found this stroke easier to
learn than the old style. Veteran butterflyers, too, are encouraged to
try this new stroke...You CAN teach an old dog new tricks!
Done right, this new butterfly is less exhausting and sustainable
over a longer distance by depending more on the large muscles of
the trunk and less on the smaller muscles of the limbs.

Working Out
Body Position
Because butterfly is a symmetrical stroke and both sides of the body
operate in simultaneous motion, a rocking, or tipping, motion is
used to achieve leverage (Figure 3.19).
The swimmer shifts his or her
weight subtly but rhythmically
forward and back, so the most
leverage is gained from each
stroke. Without this shift of
weight, the butterfly loses much
of its leverage, leaving the
swimmer with only the power of
the arms and legs (Figure 3.20).

to remember that, although it is
necessary to have a tip both
forward and back in the

Arm Stroke
The entry position of the arms in the butterfly is in a wide “Y” slightly
outside the shoulders, with the arms extended in order to anchor the
hands firmly just below the surface of the water. Hands are best
positioned at an outward pitch, continuing the line of the “Y”,
with the thumbs slightly lower than the little fingers (Figure 3.21).

stroke is round, starting
with the hands outside

Figure 3.21 Butterfly Armstroke Entry
Although the arms do bend at the elbows
during the middle phase of the pull, as the
hands pass closer to the swimmer’s belly, it
is important to remember not to allow the
elbows to drop down or the leverage in the
arm action will be lost. With the elbow
high and firm, the swimmer’s hands can
maintain their handle on the water.
When the hands release the water at the
end of the pull, they should exit the water
with the little finger first. They should
remain in that position for as long as
possible during recovery, in order to allow
the arms to relax, or recover, and to maximize
the momentum carried forward from stroke to
stroke. Recovering in this position also avoids
the elbows dragging through the water.

Kick
The dolphin kick used in the butterfly is more than a leg action. It is
a full body action, and so, it would be more accurately described as
a “dolphin action” rather than a kick (Figure 3.23). When learning the
dolphin, it is a very good idea to observe fish. Their dolphin action
is fluid, like a wave, and is not a big motion, with a lot of effort or
splashing. Their dolphin is a very integrated action that is initiated in
the “core,” and is transferred in a whiplike action to the tail. Notice,
that fish do not have knees, hips, waist, or a neck that would break
the whip action of the dolphin. If you study a fish swimming, notice
how it is so fluid that it appears as if it has no bones. This is
how we, as humans, must approach the dolphin, like fish do. After all, they
are the experts.
Two kicks occur during each butterfly stroke. The first kick sends the
swimmer forward and slightly downward with the beginning of the
arm stroke, and the second kick sends the swimmer forward and
slightly upward with the end of the arm stroke.

Breathing
Breathing in butterfly must be done within the line of the stroke, or
it can work like putting on the brakes. Breathing is best done
forward, neck extended like a turtle coming out of his shell, in order
to continue the forward momentum of the stroke (Figure 3.24).
Allow very little clearance from the water, by keeping the chin on the
surface of the water. This avoids lifting oneself too high so the
tipping motion of the stroke becomes out of balance and an “uphill”
butterfly occurs. Looking down at the water, while breathing, rather
than at the wall in front ahead will keep the head within the line of
the stroke. The face clears the water to breathe during the first part of
the pull, as the chest rises. The face returns to the water an instant
before the hands reach the wide “Y” at the end of the recovery.

Coordination
Butterfly works on leverage. The arms enter the water in front of the
swimmer as a wide “Y”, outside of the shoulders while the head
stays firmly in a neutral position. When in this position, the swimmer
presses downward on the water with the chest, shifting his or her
weight as far forward as possible. As the chest presses downward,
the hips rise, producing a “riding downhill” feeling.
In the wide “Y” arm position, with the chest low and hips high, the
swimmer is able to anchor the hands in the water, then vault his or
her body forward past the hands, by sliding the hips down and
forward toward the anchored hands.
The arm stroke becomes short and quick, and the kick actually
becomes a consequence of the chest and hip-tipping movement, not
an independent action. The first kick is achieved when the hands are
in front of the swimmer in the wide “Y”. The action of pressing the
chest down and letting the hips rise up creates a lever-like action
that whips down to the feet, thus resulting in a kick.
The second kick is achieved as the swimmer finishes vaulting past
the hands, at the end of the breath, with another whiplike action
that extends to the feet. At this point, the swimmer has shifted his or
her weight back toward the hips. As the recovery begins, once again,
the swimmer shifts his or her weight forward.

long, in effect what happens is that you lift water up and pull
yourself down, lower, into the water. Try finishing your arm stroke by
sweeping slightly out to the side. Doing so should help your hands
release the water better.

Your second kick may also be too early. The downbeat of the second
kick plays an important role in giving you the lift and power to get
your arms back to the front. It should occur with the finish of the
underwater arm stroke, before the recovery begins. Hold the second
kick until that point. It could also be that you may be recovering
with your elbows down, so that they drag through the water,

BREASTSTROKE
Breaststroke has changed more than any other stroke over the past
few decades. Many Masters swimmers who competed as children
remember the rules of breaststroke meant that it had to be
performed very carefully: The top of a swimmer’s head had to stay
out of the water at all times, the arm stroke had to be completely
underwater, and the hips remained motionless. Swimmers struggled
to achieve speed with these limitations, experimenting with extremely
wide kicks and huge arm circles to move themselves forward.
Changes in the official rules for breaststroke have eliminated these
restrictions. Swimmers and coaches have developed ways to access
more leverage, and to minimize the drag that is an inherent problem
in the stroke. Breaststroke has become more efficient and faster. In
fact, breaststroke records across the board have increased
dramatically since the new rules have been adopted.
Basically, the new breaststroke allows swimmers to depart from the
flat swimming style that many of us were taught as kids and use a
motion similar to the butterfly tipping motion to power the stroke.
This has led to an almost universal practice of breathing with every
stroke, which is also different than years past. There is also less of a

Working Out
glide phase in the newer stroke, as swimmers work to accelerate the
rate of the stroke. Some swimmers have developed an arm stroke
recovery that is completely out of the water, working from the theory
that by doing so the arms create less drag. Others rely on a partial
over-the-water recovery that they believe saves energy but still
improves the speed with which the arms return to the front.
Some things have remained the same about the breaststroke. Both
the arms and the legs are still moved in a symmetrical motion. The
feet still must remain underwater, and the sequence of the stroke is
still the same: “pull, breathe, kick, glide.” In essence, breaststroke is
no longer a relaxed, resting type of stroke. It has become a power
stroke that requires a great deal of technical perfection and precise
timing. That being said, breaststroke remains the stroke with the
most variations.
Body Position
Breaststroke is unique in that the stroke, for the most part, happens
underwater. In addition, it is the only stroke in which the kick extends
outside the profile of the body. The arm stroke, too, is unique, in that
it is shorter than other strokes, extending only to the chest. For these
reasons, a streamlined body position is important to perfect.
With actual drag being
greater than in all other
strokes, any opportunity
to move through the
water in a more
streamlined position
should be maximized.
The main opportunity in
the breaststroke to do
this is during the glide phase of the stroke, which occurs as the kick
finishes and the arms have already reached the front and the face is
in the water. Though the length of the glide is extremely variable
from breaststroker to breaststroker, the bottom line is that this phase of
Figure 3.25 Breaststroke Tipping Motion

--- Page 108 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:41 Uhr Seite 108
Masters Swimming
the stroke should be held for as long as it is productive in order to
benefit from the power and forward motion of the previous stroke.
Gliding slightly “downhill” is the position breaststrokers strive for.
As in butterfly, a rocking, or tipping motion is used while the
swimmer performs the symmetrical arm stroke and kick (Figure 3.25).
The degree of this tipping varies greatly from swimmer to swimmer,
but the essential practice of shifting one’s weight forward and back is
the way leverage is applied to each stroke. By using a tipping motion
in breaststroke, which is powered by the leverage in the core, the
swimmer pulls himself or herself up and forward to breathe, and kicks
himself or herself down and forward to glide.
Arm Stroke
The arm stroke in breaststroke produces the least forward motion of any
of the four competitive strokes. It takes a shorter, and more lateral path
than the other strokes. Some swimmers compare the breaststroke arm
stroke to sculling more than pulling. From the starting point of extended
arms and hands held together in a point (Figure 3.26), the hands press
outward, to a wide “Y” position similar to the butterfly. The hands
anchor slightly outside the line of the shoulders, just below the surface
of the water. At this point, the hands are
pitched outward, thumbs downward. From
there, the hands change their pitch to a
thumbs-up position as the path of the pull,
or skull, changes directions and presses
inward, slightly toward the chest. The
swimmer strives to hold on to the same
water the whole time. During this inward
sweep the elbows are held high and firm
for the most leverage. As the hands come
together in front of the chest, the
elbows fold in toward the ribs, the
water is released, and the recovery begins.

Working Out
Swimmers recover their arms in a variety of positions. Some begin
the recovery with their hands together and pointed, and shoot them
forward into streamline. Others recover with their palms together
and then shift to a palms-down position upon full extension. Where
the arms are in relation to the water during recovery also varies
widely. Some swimmers recover their arms entirely over the water, in
order to minimize the drag of an underwater recovery. This requires a
great deal of upper body strength, as these swimmers must get their
bodies higher out of the water to achieve it. Some swimmers start
their recovery with their hands out of the water, then dive them
down and forward in order to increase the momentum of the
“downhill” glide. Others recover with their hands submerged
completely, in a less dramatic, but tried and true fashion. Despite the
variations in recovery style, it is agreed that the recovery should be
done quickly, in order to get back to streamline and into the starting
position for another stroke. The breaststroke recovery should appear
as if the swimmer is threading a needle with his or her hands,
elbows, shoulders and head, chest, hips, legs and finally the feet.
Kick
Breaststroke is the only stroke in which the
kick produces more power than the arms.
The breaststroke kick is the most technically
complex kick, requiring the feet to go from
maximum flex to maximum point during each
kick (Figure 3.27). Three sets of joints are
involved in the breaststroke kick: those in
the hips, knees, and ankles. Of these three,
the hip joints move the least. This seems
contrary to what seems to be happening
when observing the breaststroke kick, with
its frog-like retraction of the legs, and the
circular path that the kick takes. In reality,
the hips bend just slightly, as the legs
prepare to kick. During the actual kick, the

hips hold firm until the very end. This
allows more water to pass by the
swimmer, instead of bumping into him
or her, producing drag (Figure 3.28).
Correct
The bend of the knees is more
significant, as the swimmer draws the
heels back toward the hips as far as
possible, with the knees opening
about shoulder width apart, or at least
wider apart than the heels (Figure 3.29).

are able to finish their kick by clapping the soles of their
feet together. Simultaneously, the legs lift, so the feet finish
slightly higher than the hips, preparing for the “downhill” glide.
Breathing
The breathing in breaststroke is possible through the natural lever
effect of the stroke. It is therefore not necessary to raise the chin to
clear the face from the water to inhale or to lower the chin to return
the face back into the water. In fact, “nodding,” or altering, the chin
position actually breaks the lever of the stroke.
The breathing should happen when the chest is at its highest point
and the hips are at their lowest. Keeping the head firmly in the line
of the stroke, the swimmer should be looking down at the water
(Figure 3.31), not at the other end of the pool when inhaling. By
holding the head firm, the breathing action does not interrupt the

breathing technique, where the chin leads the body up and down
rather than forward. The amount each swimmer’s face clears the
water when breathing varies widely.

Figure 3.31 Breaststroke Breathing Alignment
Coordination
Probably more than any other stroke, timing is a crucial factor in
breaststroke. If the power movements of the breaststroke are timed
incorrectly, the innate periods of drag in the stroke can actually
cancel each other out (Figure 3.32). The correct sequence of the
breaststroke is “pull, breathe, kick, glide.” Some swimmers have
distilled this four-part sequence into two actions: “pull and breathe,
then kick and glide.” However, the sequence remains the same.
While, unlike the other strokes, it is the kick that produces the most
power in the breaststroke, the kick does not work in isolation. It is
connected in essence to other actions of the stroke. For instance,
breathing in breaststroke serves two purposes. First, of course, it

gives the swimmer an opportunity to get new air. Second, in the
breathing position, the body is tipped back, head high and hips low,
allowing the most water to cover the feet at the point when they are
drawn up to their maximum bend toward the hips, in preparation to kick.
The arm stroke and breathing are closely timed to finish and return
to streamline just before the kick finishes. This allows the maximum
forward motion to be achieved from the kick, while the potential
drag of the arm stroke recovery and the “uphill” position of the
breathing is minimized.

Conditioning
5.1
THE PROCESS
Conditioning, often called “getting in shape,” is the process of getting
the body used to exercising. It involves subjecting the
body to a workload it is not used to, then allowing the body to
eventually adapt to that workload, resulting in the body becoming
able to do more swimming faster. The process of conditioning involves
the development of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, the
toning of existing muscle, and the building of new muscle. Through the
process of conditioning, these systems work together to increase the
body’s capacity for endurance and speed (Figure 3.33).
Figure 3.33
Illustrated on a graph, the process of conditioning does not yield
results in a steady upward trend. Instead, the results of conditioning
take a path similar to a staircase (Figure 3.34). There are periods of
obvious improvement, followed by periods known as plateaus, where
all the work that a swimmer does seems to make no difference. To
avoid getting discouraged during the process of conditioning, this real
path of improvement is an important thing to remember.

Working Out
There is no cut and dry timeline for conditioning to produce results.
It is a very individual thing, with many variables, including level of
fitness at the beginning of the process and the amount of time a
swimmer needs to recover and adapt. A skilled coach will design a
conditioning program with these issues in mind. For Masters
swimmers, the main issue is recovery. Periods for recovery are as
important in the process as periods of work. Without periods of
recovery, adaptation to the workload will not happen well. In fact, as
we age, longer periods of recovery are generally required. In most
cases, Masters swimmers should not swim everyday.
PLATEAU
They should instead skip a day between workouts, or at least every
third day, allowing time for their bodies to recover. If they don’t
allow recovery time, they will learn to swim tired, and the trend of
improving endurance and speed will stop because adaptation will
not really occur. Also significant is the issue of a swimmer’s activity
level at the beginning of the conditioning process. Some swimmers
are able to start out doing 3,000 yards, while others can only do

1,000 yards. Good results from a conditioning program happen when
the percentage of each individual swimmer’s potential workload is
increased incrementally, rather than when all swimmers start with
the identical workload and increase the same amount. The
improvement curve is not a function of how much a swimmer swims
but is instead related more to what a swimmer is capable of doing.
When a swimmer achieves adaptation to a certain level of workload,
there are two ways to proceed in order to maintain the trend of
improvement. First, a swimmer may swim the same amount of work
but do it faster. Second, a swimmer’s workload may be increased in
time and quantity. A plan of combining these two approaches in an
alternating pattern works well for many swimmers to produce more
endurance and speed.
Finally, the process of conditioning is just that: a process. Keeping
this in mind, swimmers should strive to experience the process fully,
instead of just looking beyond it to the goal of “being in shape.” The
process of conditioning is, in fact, ongoing as a swimmer continues
to reach for further improvement. It is a good feeling to improve. It is
an equally good feeling to work toward improvement.
5.2
ELEMENTS OF A WORKOUT
When planning a workout, a good coach has a goal in mind for the
swimmers doing the workout. Whether that goal is general
conditioning, swim meet readiness, stroke versatility, or something
else, the elements of the workout are not random. In addition, the
specific combination of elements are designed to help swimmers
reach the goal most effectively. This is why swimmers are
encouraged to stay for the entire workout, even if they don’t finish
each set completely. It is like when your mother served you dinner
as a child. There were several foods on the plate. Mom was really
happy when you ate everything. And she wasn’t happy at all when
you ate all the chicken but didn’t touch your peas and carrots. But, if
you ate some of everything, Mom was usually okay with it because
she knew you got the full range of nutrients. Getting the most out of
a workout is the same way. If you get out halfway through, you miss
some of the beneficial elements entirely. Sometimes it can’t be
avoided, but as a regular practice, staying for the whole workout
gives you a more well-rounded fitness result.

Working Out
In general, a swimming workout includes the following elements:
Warm up
The first activity of a workout is the warm-up, which allows
swimmers to prepare their bodies to work by loosening up joints
and muscles, increasing blood circulation, and practicing good
stroke technique at a relaxed but sustained speed. The warm-up is
best quantified in minutes, rather than yards. A good warm-up
should consist of at least ten minutes of sustained swimming.
Kicking
Kicking early in the workout serves as a secondary warm-up. The
large muscles in the legs carry a great deal of oxygen-rich blood
through them. Kicking raises the heart rate a little, easing the
swimmer’s systems further into work mode. Of all the kicks, flutter
kick, both on front and back, is the most aerobic, and the best
choice for warm-up-type sets. Kicking may also be used to increase
speed with short distance sets and to build endurance by kicking as
a part of a long swim set. Lastly, kicking may be used as recovery,
or “active rest,” where there is no interval or goal time, just
medium-strength kicking while the swimmer’s heart rate has an
opportunity to return to a lower rate, while he or she is still moving.

Pulling
Many coaches use pulling as stroke work. Truly, a pull buoy does
correct the body position of most swimmers, giving them the feeling
of how they are supposed to float without the pull buoy. Alternating
pulling and swimming, by 200 or more, is a good exercise to bridge
the improved body position that pulling gives to unassisted
swimming. In addition to accentuating body position, pulling with a
pull buoy should be used to focus on generating swimming power
from the core.
Many swimmers report that pulling stresses their shoulders. This is
because they are moving through the water flat, getting power from
their shoulders, rather than rolling into each pull using their core.
Once stroke technique is corrected, pulling can be used to build
endurance with long distance pull sets. Sprint pulling is of little value
because most swimmers find pulling easier than when they use their
legs, too. Sprint pulling is also risky to vulnerable shoulders.
Pulling is widely accepted as a freestyle activity. There is
disagreement about using a pull buoy with other strokes. In this
coach’s opinion, backstroke pulling is not very productive because
with the arm stroke being out to the side of the body, the feet wag
from side to side if they are not in motion, making pulling backstroke
an exercise in correcting one’s direction, rather than anything else.
Using a pull buoy in butterfly commonly results in lower back pain
due to the added pressure of raising and lowering the hips while the
floatation device works to keep the hips stable. The same thing is true
for breaststroke, although pulling breaststroke without a pull buoy, and
using a light dolphin kick is an excellent complement, or alternative
exercise to pulling freestyle with a pull buoy.
Stroke Drills
Including stroke drills in a workout allows swimmers the opportunity
to focus on their technique. Basically, a stroke drill is an exercise
that isolates a single aspect of a stroke in order to emphasize
correct form. It is very important for swimmers to understand exactly
what point is being emphasized by a particular stroke drill. If not, a
swimmer may not focus on the right thing, or on nothing at all, as
120

--- Page 121 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:41 Uhr Seite 121
Working Out
many stroke drills are awkward and may seem tedious at first. Some
stroke drills are done at slow speed to emphasize proper float
position, or stroke path. Other stroke drills are done at “swimming
speed” to emphasize accessing power or identifying the correct
muscle group to use. A very beneficial use of stroke drills is to
alternate them with the regular stroke, allowing swimmers to first
isolate a skill, then to immediately put it into practice by swimming
the stroke.
Endurance Sets
Endurance sets bring to mind long distance swimming. A coach may
have the swimmers swim a mile, or several 500s, to gauge progress.
There is another kind of endurance set that is very useful to the
general conditioning of swimmers and also improves pace skills, as
well as swimmer confidence. It requires a pace clock to be on deck.
Known as interval training, this kind of set calls for a number of
repetitions of a short distance to be done, with each swim, along
with a short rest period after each swim, to be completed within a
specific time interval. For instance: the coach may ask for a set of
“ten 100s on the 1:30.” This means that swimmers have a minute
and a half to swim 100 yards and to rest, before they are to do the
same thing again, until they have done it ten times in a row. Usually,
the rest period for an endurance interval set like this would be
relatively short, giving the swimmer just enough recovery so he or
she can complete the whole set.
One variation on interval training is “descending sets,” in which
swimmers are challenged to make each swim time faster than the
previous swim, while staying on the same interval. Another variation
is to increase the distance of each swim while keeping the rest the
same. This sort of set is called a “ladder,” or a “pyramid,” if the set
goes up in distances and then back down.
Interval training is a great way to gain the conditioning needed to
swim a long distance faster, because while accomplishing the same
overall distance as a straight long distance swim, the short rest
periods taken with interval training allow the swimmer to recuperate
just enough to swim faster than they would without that little rest.
Through interval training, the body gets used to swimming faster for
a long period of time.

Masters Swimming
I.M.Sets
Most swimmers have a favorite stroke, or maybe two. Many
swimmers have a stroke that they can get by with, but it wouldn’t be
their first or second choice. And almost every swimmer has a stroke
that is hard for them, that no matter how much they work on it, it is
just never quite as easy for them as the other strokes. Still, many
coaches believe that swimming versatility is important and have
their swimmers practice all the strokes. I.M., or Individual Medley is
a swim that encompasses all four competitive strokes, in the order
of butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle.
I.M. swimming has many benefits. First, by performing all the
strokes, swimmers gain more well-rounded muscle development, as
each stroke uses the major swimming muscles in a slightly different
way. Swimmers who practice I.M. develop improved balance in the
water. Because most swimmers have what they would characterize
as a worst stroke, it is likely that stroke is not used a great deal by
choice. If it weren’t for I.M., some swimmers would avoid swimming
their weak stroke completely. Swimmers who do practice their worst
stroke do improve it, even if it may never become their favorite stroke!
Swimming I.M.s gives swimmers the opportunity to compare and
contrast the way they swim the different strokes. They can ask
themselves, “What is it that makes my freestyle work, while my
backstroke is so hard?” This question can be a comparison of body
position, breathing rhythm, stroke coordination, or kicking, among
other things. Excellent “stroke contrasts” include: freestyle and
backstroke, freestyle and butterfly, and breaststroke and butterfly.
Even if swimmers are not going to do an I.M. in competition, I.M.
swimming is a great way to add variety to a workout. For those who
are competitive I.M.ers, swimming I.M.s is essential for practicing
transitions, strategy and pace.
Sprint Sets
Sprinting is a favorite activity for many swimmers. It is quick,
exciting, and fun. For adult swimmers, it is also extremely beneficial
to practice sprinting, because as we age, our muscle fiber becomes
less and less accustomed to doing explosive bursts of activity.
122

--- Page 123 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:41 Uhr Seite 123
Working Out
We must actively train our muscles to sprint, or muscles lose
the ability to do it. Sprinting requires swimmers to swim as fast as
they can. Sprints are usually very short swims of one or two lengths
of the pool. Sprint sets can resemble interval training in some ways.
Usually a number of repeats are done, with rest periods after each.
However, it is important to keep in mind that true sprinting requires a
good amount of rest. Without adequate rest, swimmers are not able to
swim with speed, and the goal of the set cannot be achieved. Doing a
number of sprints with only the same short rest as in endurance sets,
does not train muscles to sprint, it trains for endurance.
Sprinting is used for meet preparation in a variety of ways. Some
coaches have their swimmers do “broken swims,” for instance. In a
“broken swim,” an athlete who is training for a 200 is asked to swim
a 100, then a 50, then two 25s as fast as he can. After subtracting
the rest periods, a race time can be theoretically estimated. Sprinting
is also used to practice “race simulation,” during the last phase of
preparation for a big event. During this time, swimmers back off on
the amount of training they do, and instead are asked to do more
quality swimming in advance of their event. This kind of sprint set is
not made up of many repetitions but can be only one swim of a
particular event, at top speed.
Sprinting is a very demanding activity and can leave swimmers tired
even one or two days afterwards. It is therefore recommended that
sprint sets be spaced well over a training phase.
Cool Down
Cooling down is a much overlooked element of a workout. The
importance of doing this should not be ignored. “Swimming down”
allows the heart to return to its non-work mode and signals the
body that recovery can begin. It provides a chance for the lactic acid
produced during hard work to be rinsed from the muscles, avoiding
potential soreness. Cool down also gives the swimmer the
opportunity to reflect on his or her swimming, on what was great,
and what could be done better next time. A good cool down should
not be rushed and, like a warm-up, should not be a matter of yards,
but a matter of time, lasting a minimum of ten minutes.

5.3
DRY LAND TRAINING
The benefits of dry land training are well known in terms of
swimming performance and injury prevention. Dry land training is
not a replacement for training in the water but is an excellent
enhancement to a swimmer’s training routine. Masters swimmers are
encouraged to find time to build a dry land component into their
training schedule. For adult athletes, dry land training is an
extremely effective way to build and retain the capabilities of
youthful muscles used for swimming.
The original theory of dry land training put forth in the early 1800s
was that swimmers could improve their swimming technique by
practicing on the land with the assistance of various apparatuses
designed to simulate the movements of swimming. Researchers soon
realized that swimming was more than mechanical motion and that
training in the water was essential in experiencing a feel for the
water and developing a streamlined path through the water. By the
early 20th century, dry land training again became the subject of
study, but this time for the purpose of athletic performance in
swimming. Researchers observed that swimmers who participated in
specific dry land training improved quicker than those who just
trained in the water. It became clear that the role of dry land training
for swimmers was to accelerate the rate of muscle development,
which could be applied to swimming.
Aspects of Swimming Enhanced by Dry Land Training
Of the many factors that influence swimming performance,
conditioning is one that is most directly enhanced by dry land
training (Figure 3.35). As previously discussed, swimming
conditioning is the process of training the muscles to adapt to work,
leading to improvement in endurance and speed. Both of these
things can be very well learned in the water but it is quicker on land.
Perhaps even more important though, dry land training is especially
effective in maintaining and increasing the flexibility needed for
optimum swimming performance. Without flexibility, the benefits of
improved strength and endurance cannot be fully utilized. Among
adult athletes, flexibility is usually the hardest physical skill to

Working Out
maintain, as it naturally decreases with age. Studies have shown
that regular practice of quality flexibility exercises can slow this
process. Good flexibility improves body position, range of motion,
and the ability to access strength and power. It is therefore directly
connected to correct swimming technique. Masters swimmers who
include a program of flexibility work into their training are taking a
proactive step in reducing the risk of injury associated with
technique problems, in addition to improving their conditioning.
Figure 3.35
FLEXIBILITY
Flexibility exercise, commonly called stretching, is a very beneficial
activity when done correctly. However, experts agree that stretching
should be done after the muscles are warmed up or it can, ironically,
result in injury. Also, careful attention should be paid to stretching
technique and body alignment. Optimally, stretching should be part
of every workout. Some experts believe that stretching is best done
before swimming, in order to prepare the body for the workout. Some
experts believe that it is most beneficial after swimming, when the
body is most warmed up. Some experts believe that stretching both
before and after workout produces the best flexibility results. If done
before swimming, a few minutes of jogging, skipping rope or bike
riding are good ways to warm up before initiating a stretching routine.
125

Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:41 Uhr Seite 126
Masters Swimming
The act of stretching requires patience and must not be rushed.
Forcing a muscle to stretch quickly beyond its range can be worse
than not stretching at all. Short jerky movements actually make the
muscles contract in a protective reflex, defeating the whole purpose
of stretching, which is to elongate the muscles for better flexibility.
Stretching is a gradual process that yields results over time. Every
stretch should be slow and smooth, bringing the stretch to its
maximum range, and holding it there for a minimum of five to ten
seconds before releasing it slowly to a relaxed state. Knowing your
own maximum range in any particular stretching exercise is
important and must be determined by you. Listen to your body.
Stretching should not hurt. Don’t be pressured by trying to stretch to
the same degree as another athlete. Everyone is different. Stretching
becomes easier as range of motion improves over time. Finally,
executing each stretch with good posture and proper support is
important in order to get the specific benefit that a particular
stretching exercise is designed to produce. An experienced coach or
trainer can help with this. Photos A-N show stretches to improve
flexibility for swimmers.

Working Out
STRENGTH AND POWER
Strength is an essential ingredient in any athlete’s ability to perform
and avoid injury. There are three kinds of strength that can be
developed: maximum strength, strength endurance, and power. Only
the latter two correspond to swimming performance. Maximum
strength, or the ability to lift as much weight as possible, is not as
important in swimming as it is in many other sports.
However, strength endurance and power are specifically linked to
swimming well. Strength endurance is important in a swimmer being
able to maintain the use of strength over time without tiring. Power
refers to the swimmer’s ability to apply strength to produce speed.
Although swimming requires both of these types of strength, distance
swimming uses more strength endurance, while sprinting uses more power.
Many experts believe that strength training should be done close in
time to a swimming workout in order to maximize the transfer
effects. Others believe that strength training and swimming should
be done on alternating days to avoid fatigue and allow time for
recovery, especially for older adults. Dry land training for strength
development of swimmers is best pursued through a blend of
general weight bearing exercises that develop the arms, legs and
trunk and resistance exercises that simulate swimming, using the
muscle groups in combination.
In a gym, free weights and some weight machines are good for
developing general strength of specific muscle groups (Figure 3.36).
Activities that duplicate the path of the pull and the leverage used in
swimming are found on pulley-type machines or equipment with
adjustable hydraulic resistance. It is important to remember that
when using weights and weight machines to benefit swimming
performance, lifting the heaviest weights possible is not very helpful.
When lifting weights, the weight should be controlled up and down.
The most effective way to use weights to build strength that is
applicable to swimming is to use only enough weight so that many
repetitions of an exercise can be done in a row, simulating the
repetitive actions of swimming. To train for strength endurance, more
repetitions are done at a rate resembling the swimmer’s stroke rate.
Weight should amount to more than the resistance of the water but

compromised. Commonly, five to ten sets of up to 25 repetitions of a
single exercise are appropriate. To direct the exercise to increase
power, the number of repetitions should decrease to 3 to 5 sets of 6
to 10 repetitions, with a slightly increased weight. Weight training
exercises can also be measured by time, with more time spent doing

ENDURANCE
A swimmer’s general endurance and cardiovascular capabilities are
most successfully trained in the water. Accomplished athletes with
extreme endurance on land find themselves unable to sustain
swimming for a substantial length of time or to recover from
swimming activities quickly without devoting time to training in the water.
However, swimmers who add land exercise for endurance into their
training routine find that they are more able to do more swimming
without fatigue. For adult athletes especially, endurance training on
land seems to benefit swimming endurance prominently, enabling
Masters swimmers to do longer workouts and faster distance swimming.
The following activities are recommended to enhance
swimming endurance:
1. Jogging or running
2. Hiking
3. Biking
4. Cross country skiing
5. Kayaking, canoeing, rowing
6. Water aerobics
These activities should be done steadily at an intensity that is
sustainable 20 to 60 minutes.
Dry land training is an extremely beneficial activity to add to any
swimming routine. It enhances conditioning done in the water in
many ways. Even if increased speed and endurance are not your
goals, dry land training is especially important to Masters swimmers
to improve flexibility and prevent injuries.

6 Achieving Better
Swimming
Of the many factors that affect swimming performance (Figure 3.38),
one cannot be isolated as the most important. They are connected,
and one aspect affects another. Achieving better swimming is a
matter of developing a well-balanced workout routine that
encompasses swimming technique work, conditioning in the water,
and dry land training.
By doing so, you develop your ability to eliminate drag, feel the
water and access potential power, while developing your endurance,
speed and the ability to recover, along with increasing your
flexibility, strength and power. When you work to achieve better

Achieving Better
Swimming

Of the many factors that affect swimming performance (Figure 3.38),
one cannot be isolated as the most important. They are connected,
and one aspect affects another. Achieving better swimming is a
matter of developing a well-balanced workout routine that
encompasses swimming technique work, conditioning in the water,
and dry land training.

By doing so, you develop your ability to eliminate drag, feel the
water and access potential power, while developing your endurance,
Speed and the ability to recover, along with increasing your
flexibility, strength and power. When you work to achieve better
Swimming, you are working toward more efficient and more
sustainable swimming, which is just more enjoyable.

Swimming is both a team and individual sport. To experience it fully,
a swimmer must belong to a team. Masters swimming has been built
through the swim team experience. Masters swimmers thrive in the
team environment, where they swim side by side, each reaching for
a unique goal, where camaraderie surrounds them, and where adult
swimming fitness is the common denominator.

Finding an Existing Team
1.1
WHERE TO LOOK
More and more, Masters swim teams are becoming part of the
regular programming offered at many swim centers. Chances are you
will be able to find an existing team within a short drive of your
home or your work. Start by locating the swimming pools in your
area, and then make a few phone calls, or do a little web surfing to
determine which pools in your area offer Masters swimming
programs. A good starting place is to look for pools offering Masters
swimming through city recreation departments, public school
districts, colleges and universities, and YMCAs. You may also be able
to get some good leads by asking other adult athletes.
1.2
WHAT YOU WANT
When looking for a team to join, you should think about what is
important to you in a swimming program. For instance, you might be
particularly interested in swimming in an outdoor pool. It might be a
priority for you to swim with people of your same age. You might be
looking for a coach specializing in distance swimming. You might be
looking for a team with an easy-going attitude. These are some of
the considerations that are really a matter of personal preference.
Finding a team that “fits” your needs and expectations is important
in developing a long lasting, beneficial and enjoyable relationship
with Masters swimming.

WHAT TO ASK
When making contact with a team representative, you might want to
have a series of questions ready to help you learn more about the
team. These questions may include:
• What is the workout schedule?
• What is the cost?
• How would a swimmer of your level fit in?
• About how many swimmers attend each workout?
• Does the team compete?
• How many yards are done at an average workout?
• How much time is devoted to technique?
Some Masters swim teams have a policy that new swimmers must
try out for a few workouts before officially joining. Beyond asking
questions, actually participating in the team’s activities is probably
the best way to determine if there is a good “fit,” and whether your
expectations of a swimming program will be met.

Structuring a New Team
If there isn’t a Masters swim team operating in your area, you could
start one. It is a very exciting proposition to set up a new team. If
you are up to the challenge, there are many factors that must be
examined in order to create a team structure that will operate
smoothly and continue over the long term.
As with most endeavors, research and planning is essential to
success. Working out details in advance is the best way to ensure a
strong program, that will not collapse when obstacles arise. Some
things that should be defined before your team begins are:
2.1
PHILOSOPHY
Defining a new team’s approach to swimming and direction is
important in establishing a foundation on which to build. Many
teams develop a Mission Statement, which states their philosophy.
The Mission Statement is a concise expression of the team’s
philosophy, which usually outlines:
• who the team will serve
• the general focus of the team
• the benefits that will occur from the team
The following are two examples of Mission Statements:
Mission Statementof the Richmond Sharks
The Richmond Sharks will exist to provide the community with a
dynamic, coach-driven competitive swim program that will promote a
life-long love of swimming and benefit the whole person by focusing on:
• Swimming excellence through ongoing technique and
conditioning work
• Apositive and supportive environment that emphasizes good
sportsmanship, team work, positive self image and work ethic
• Ongoing opportunities for healthy competition

swimming available to adult athletes by providing high level

2.2
THE BUSINESS OF THE TEAM
Planning how team business will be handled is essential in setting
up a smoothly operating Masters swimming program. There are three
ways in which the business operations of swim teams are commonly
structured. The first is when the swim team is a program sponsored
or run entirely by a city, school district or other larger entity.
In this case, the operations are handled by that larger entity.
The finances, employees, and schedule are all taken care of by that
entity. There are many reasons that teams seek this sort of structure.
First and foremost, there is no financial risk for the team. With
all expenses covered, including pool time, coach’s salary and
equipment, more attention can be paid to the swimming activities
of the program.
On the other hand, there are drawbacks. Ateam can be under constant
pressure to prove its value or risk losing its pool time. Also, many
times, the team has no input in who makes up the coaching staff.
Sometimes the coach may be simply a lifeguard assigned to the task.
The team may also not get the support it needs because important
decisions are made by managers who are not necessarily interested in
Masters swimming. While very safe in terms of financial responsibility,
this kind of team structure gives very little control to the team.
The second way a team may structure its operations is as a non-profit
organization, with a board of directors, usually made up of team
members, which makes the business and operational decisions for
the team. This is a popular way to organize a team because it gives
the team complete control over its own operations and direction. The
team chooses its own coaching staff. The team makes its own
rules and procedures. Everyone involved is dedicated to swimming.

2.2

Masters Swimming
The major drawback of this model is that the organization is usually
run by volunteers, who may or may not have the time needed to
devote to team operations. At times, the work may fall unevenly to a
few individuals, or to one person, which can lead to resentment.
Important business can be left undone. Also, as a non-profit
organization, the team needs to bring in enough money to pay for
its own pool time, coach and equipment, through team dues. If dues
do not equal expenses, the organization must cut back its hours and
employees, or devote its time and energy to fundraising campaigns.
The benefits of this kind of structure are very positive, but it is labor
intensive to make it work right over the long term.
To curb expenses, some teams running as non-profit organizations
use a rotating coach method. On these teams, each team member
volunteers to coach the other members of the team for a day or a
week at a time. Everyone takes a turn, and the expense of a paid
coach is eliminated. This sort of cost-saving measure depends on
the cooperation of every swimmer. It usually yields some very
creative workouts but makes continuity of conditioning and
technique an issue of concern.
The third kind of structure is a coach run program. In this case, the
coach operates the business of the team, as well as doing the
coaching. He or she collects dues, pays for the pool rental, and he or
she gets what is left over as compensation. The strengths of this
kind of structure include a coach who is probably highly motivated
to run an excellent program.
Acoach who “owns” a team will usually have a clear vision of what a
great swim team should be and be highly dedicated to its success.
Growth of the team and athlete development will probably be top
priorities. On the down side, running a team is a huge job that takes
ongoing attention, leading to the possible burnout of the coach if he
or she is not getting the compensation worthy of the job. For a small
team, adequate compensation for the coach could mean more
expensive swimming for team members. Many coach-run programs
are very successful. Others are short lived.

2.3
COACHING
On any successful sports team, the coach is recognized as an
important force in the team’s morale, development and success. The
coach is usually seen as the leader of the team, someone who
possesses experience and knowledge of the sport, the ability to
teach, challenge and motivate athletes, and the presence to unify,
mobilize and drive the team to new heights. The most successful
Masters swim teams have coaches who fit this description.
When selecting a swim coach for your new team, it is important to
remember that the coach will be seen as the face of your team. The
coach that you choose will be a major factor in attracting new
swimmers and retaining the swimmers on your team. When looking
at candidates, considering those with experience in competitive
swimming may or may not be a good choice. Although such a
candidate will have an understanding of the swim team
environment, being a good swimmer does not necessarily mean a
person is a good coach. A candidate with experience coaching
swimming brings an understanding of the requirements of
leadership, time management, and workout structure. Direct
experience with adult athletes is even better, as there are distinct
differences in coaching youth and Masters swimming. Experience in
teaching swimming is also a desirable quality as many adults join
Masters swimming with only basic swimming skills. A candidate with
experience teaching advanced swimming technique is highly
desirable, as improving swimming efficiency is an ongoing quest of
Masters swimmers.
Coaching Masters Swimmers
Coaching Masters swimmers is a very rewarding experience. A coach
shares the excitement of an adult swimmer who learns a new skill,
the pride of an adult swimmer who exceeds his or her own
expectations, and the exhilaration of an adult athlete who continues
to defy age. These feelings shared by coach and athlete are genuine
and remarkable.

Masters Swimming
The relationship that develops between an athlete and coach is
quite special. Unlike the relationship of a youth athlete and an adult
coach, which is at its base unequal in terms of power, knowledge,
and life experience, the relationship of a Masters swimmer and his or
her coach is in many ways that of equals. It can be seen as a
partnership between two adults, who each have something to bring
to the experience. When both athlete and coach are involved in
decisions, a different dynamic is present. The athlete may choose to
focus on butterfly technique, and the coach will come up with drills
to improve the swimmer’s stroke. The coach will lay out a training
program for a particular swim meet, and the athlete will make the
decision on what events to train for.
With swimming at
the center, at
times the swimmer
can take the lead
and at other times
the coach can take
the lead. This kind
of partnership is
based in mutual
respect and trust.
It is a working
relationship, which
is as close as many friendships. Coaching Masters swimming is also
very challenging. The partnership between Masters athlete and coach
is sometimes tested. For instance, a Masters swimmer may decide
not to do what the coach has assigned, not because of a health
limitation, but just because he or she doesn’t want to. When an
adult athlete chooses not to do something, the coach has no real
authority to make him or her do it.
The coach cannot send the swimmer home with a note to his or her
parent, or order him or her to swim a 500 butterfly for disobedience.
Instead, the coach must be flexible and creative in maintaining the
partnership. Without compromising the team’s activities, the coach
may offer an alternate activity that accomplishes the same goal as

the set that was rejected. If a particular swimmer frequently decides
to do their own thing, a private conversation may be called for, in
order to reestablish the coach/athlete partnership. The swimmer’s
goals should be discussed, and it should be determined how they
can be met in the Masters swimming group workout environment.
Some Masters swimmers are also reluctant to try new things
presented by the coach. They may spend an undue amount of time
and energy analyzing a newly presented technique and justifying
why the old way is good enough, leaving little or no opportunity to
actually try it. Although swimming is considered a “thinking sport,”
some Masters swimmers can get bogged down in trying to
understand new things intellectually and rationalizing why not to try
them. This can lead to long discussions with the coach in the middle
of a workout. A coach cannot force a reluctant swimmer to swim a
new way. A coach can only offer the new skill as an opportunity for
a new experience. Reluctant swimmers should be encouraged to
have fun with new experiences. With a supportive, non-judgemental
partnership, trying a new skill can be less threatening. New horizons
can become things to approach together.
Coaching a Masters Swim Team
While the diversity of Masters swimmers is one of its highlights, it
also presents one of the biggest challenges to creating a sense of a
team. Team dynamics are different in Masters swimming than in
youth swimming. On youth competitive swim teams, the common
goal of all swimmers is to compete as a team. In Masters swimming,
this is not a goal shared by everyone.
Some Masters swimmers compete but others swim for fitness. Still
others swim purely for the social opportunities. There is also the
matter of the wide range of swimming ability and ages in Masters
swimming. The needs of a national class swimmer are different than
a novice swimmer. And the needs of an 85-year-old swimmer are
different than those of a 25-year-old swimmer. With so many different
agendas, and so many levels of ability, a coach has a big job in
meeting the various needs of the swimmers on the team and keeping
them all “swimming” in the same direction. The unifying factor of
143

The Masters Swim Team

--- Page 144 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:42 Uhr Seite 144
Masters Swimming
Masters swimming that must kept in mind is adult swimming fitness.
This is what all of these swimmers have in common. The task of the
coach is to emphasize this commonality, despite the distinct
differences among individuals and unify the team’s activities toward
this goal. This is sometimes easier said than done. At times, the
needs of a national class sprinter will seem to be at odds with the
needs of a distance swimmer. An 85-year-old swimmer may not be
served well by doing the same set as a younger fitness swimmer.
With all of these swimmers in the pool at the same time, how can a
coach meet each individual’s needs, while successfully creating a
sense of team and unified team workouts? Here are some ideas:
1. Create “distance lanes” and “sprint lanes” for a main set,
with each set requiring about the same length of time.
2. Have faster swimmers do more repetitions of a set and
slower swimmers do fewer, so they finish at approximately
the same time.
3. Build options into sets.
4. Assign swims by time instead of distance. For instance, have
everyone do a 10-minute swim.
5. Assign “social kicking” to all swimmers at the same time.
All of these ideas require excellent time management, set editing,
and awareness of each individual’s needs by the coach.
It may seem, at times, that a coach is running six workouts at once.
Done well, this kind of individualized workout will have a very
unified feeling as swimmers finish sets together, rest together, do
heads-up activities, such as kicking together, and complete the workout
and cool down together.
Another job of a team coach is to make sure every swimmer knows
that his or her participation on the team is important. The essence of
successful team is that each individual is a valued part of the group.
Accomplishing this requires the coach to connect personally with
every swimmer, and to maintain that connection. A good coach
should have direct interaction with every single swimmer in the pool
during a workout. The dialogue with each swimmer will be different.

With one, a coach may discuss backstroke technique. With another,
the coach will talk about an upcoming swim meet. With another
swimmer, there will be congratulations on a promotion. And with
another, a troublesome shoulder might be addressed. With still
another, the recent
death of a parent
can be touched upon.
And yet another, a
coach may suggest
moving up a lane.
Another swimmer
will announce to
the coach that she
is pregnant. Some
conversations focus
on swimming directly,
some focus more on
the swimmer, and seem to have nothing to do with swimming. The
pool becomes a place where each swimmer feels connected to the team
through swimming, as well as through the coach.
Clearly, the job of coaching a Masters swim team is not an easy one!
It takes an organized, caring, responsive, adaptable, knowledgeable,
energetic and creative individual to bring a Masters swim team
together. It is a very rewarding occupation.
2.4
WATER TIME
In order to have a successful Masters swim team, you must secure
water time, so you can hold workouts. It is best to have a regular,
predictable schedule in order to build continuity on the team.
However, this is sometimes quite a challenge. Although Masters
swimming is gaining popularity, it is sometimes difficult to get
desirable water time. Often, Masters teams are given the leftovers:
5:00 a.m., 8:30 p.m., or even only on weekends, while other
programs, including more valued youth swim teams, are given more
and “better” hours. If you are lucky enough to get good water time,
run with it! Make the most of it! But in the more common situation
that you are presented with a poor schedule, you must be creative.

Masters Swimming
You might advertise an ungodly early morning time slot as a
“Commuter Special.” You might spin a non-ideal night workout as an
“Unwinding Swim.” Teams that are given only weekend pool time
might have to become “dual pool teams” and pick up additional
weekday hours at other pools to build a solid program. Over time,
as your team grows in size, strength and popularity, you may find
that you will be given better hours.
2.5
PROGRAM
A dynamic Masters Swimming program begins with a schedule of
workouts but goes far beyond. It consists of mechanisms designed
to draw new swimmers in, and keep them inspired to come back,
allowing the program to grow and thrive. The program you set up is
the way you “deliver” on your mission statement.
Continuity and Variety
The activities of your program should be exciting and interesting to
swimmers, but they should also offer a sense of routine. Swimmers
should know what to expect from your program in terms of the
quality of the program and the coaching. When swimmers arrive for
a workout, and it is cancelled either due to a time change or the
coach not showing up, swimmers get discouraged quickly.
Swimmers should know what to expect from the workout
organization and atmosphere. Swimmers should always be greeted
and welcomed by the coach on the pool deck. They should know
what lane to go to and what to do when they first get in the water.
Swimmers should also know what the expectations are in terms of
actual swimming. They should know that they will get feedback on
their strokes. They should know about how many yards the workouts
are on average. They should know they will be challenged.
Continuity is important, but variety is important, too. The content
and focus of workouts themselves should not be the same all the
time or swimmers can get bored. Coaches who are creative in
designing workouts give their swimmers a sense of curiosity and
anticipation, and a reason to come back for another workout.

The Masters Swim Team
Feeder Programs
One way to create a steady flow of people into your program is
through feeder programs. A feeder program is a developmental
program, in which the next logical step is your swim team. Feeder
programs that work well for Masters swim teams include:
SWIMMING LESSONS
Swimming lessons for adults are not offered enough. With good
advertising, adult lesson programs are often well attended by adults
of all ages. Many adults are actually embarrassed that they do not
know how to swim and jump at the chance to learn swimming skills.
Some beginning adult swimmers have had drowning and water
anxiety issues since childhood and are very motivated to move
beyond their fears. Many individuals just learning to swim will
exhibit raw swimming talent, improve quickly, and they become
confident, efficient swimmers. Adults feeling the success of their new
swimming skills should be invited to join your swim team and
continue to build their skills and enjoyment of swimming.
STROKE CLINICS
Stroke clinics work as feeder programs when people from the larger
pool community are offered the opportunity to study and practice a
swimming stroke as a one-time experience with a swimming expert,
such as your Masters swim team coach.
A stroke clinic can be structured in many ways, but to be most
meaningful to people not yet involved in Masters swimming, it
should include a step-by-step explanation of the technique of the
stroke being studied, a demonstration of that stroke, practice time
and feedback. Using a blend of classroom activities, such as lecture
and video, and water activities including stroke drills and guided
practice, swimmers who attend a stroke clinic learn new and exciting
things about their swimming. Astroke clinic, or series of clinics, put on
by your team is a great way to introduce swimmers to what Masters
swimming is all about.

Masters Swimming
Specialized Workouts
Offering specialized workouts gives swimmers an extra incentive to
pursue a special swimming avenue in more detail. Specialized
workouts should be offered in addition to regular team workouts,
not instead of them, to avoid dividing the team. Specialized
workouts tailored to certain groups and activities may change with
the make up of your team. Specialized workouts can be held for:
SENIORS
Although many elderly swimmers participate fully in regular Masters
swimming workouts, some express that they feel intimidated and
often overlooked. Some seniors report that they feel pushed to the
outside lanes, far from the main energy of the workout where
younger swimmers swim faster and farther. A specialized workout for
seniors, held once or twice a week is often very much appreciated. It
is a time when they can set the pace, swim in the fast lane, and be
the main focus of the workout.
OPEN WATER
Because open water swimming is one of the favorite Masters
swimming activities, swimmers are often very interested in getting
extra experience by training in an open water setting. Some teams
meet once a week at a local lake or marina to swim together.
Team open water swims are often very popular specialized workouts
and attract new swimmers regularly. Special care should be taken to
prepare new swimmers for their first open water experience.
Their swimming should be strong in both technique and endurance.
They should be able to deal with colder temperatures than the pool,
which are sometimes shocking to the body. They should be able to
negotiate waves and currents, which can be deceptively strong and
unnerving. It is a good practice to assign a buddy to a first-time open
water swimmer, to ensure the experience is both pleasant and safe.
The coach accompanying the group should be a certified lifeguard.

NATIONALS
Swimmers who set their sights on competing at a National
Championship, or other high level swim meet will benefit from
specialized workouts dedicated to their goal. A ten to twelve
week program where your
National team trains together
twice a week, and with the
whole team the rest of the
time, will create strong morale
and more specific conditioning
results for your Nationals bound
athletes. Training for high-
level meets can be extremely
demanding and stressful, and a
dedicated workout time provides
the opportunity for coach and
athlete to devote direct attention
toward a successful outcome to
this effort of major proportions.

Special Team Activities
Special team activities are instrumental in developing a positive
team atmosphere. Special events give swimmers something to look
forward to as a team and create good memories for and about the
team. These activities may include:
HOLIDAY WORKOUTS
Holidays offer an excellent opportunity to hold workouts because
most people have the day off and enjoy spending some of their
down time swimming. Holiday workouts are often the best attended
workouts of the year. Many teams make holiday workouts into
special occasions by offering extra challenging or themed workouts.
Sometimes a brunch follows the workout.
Some teams “ring in the new year” with a memorable New Year’s
morning workout of extreme proportions! Some teams hold annual
“Fitness Before the Feast” workouts early Thanksgiving morning.
Some teams even celebrate the coach’s birthday in holiday style by
swimming 100 yards for each year of the coach’s age. Holiday
workouts offer teams the opportunity to establish and carry on
tradition. They are talked about long after the holiday is over.
SOCIALS
Holding team social events effectively promotes a cohesive team.
The social aspects of Masters swimming are as important to many
swimmers as the swimming. A team gathering outside of the water
deepens the bonds that swimmers have formed while swimming and
makes the team further connected to the rest of their lives.
Social events may take many forms. Some teams have a monthly
dinner at a favorite restaurant after one workout. Others have a
potluck dinner, meeting at the home of a different team member
each time. Some teams hold annual picnics, softball games or bike
rides. Other Masters swimming favorites include:

Awards Banquet
An annual awards dinner is very meaningful to swimmers, as much
for the recognition as it is for the team spirit. Swimmers and their
families and guests should be invited to attend, making for a very
large group to share
the team’s celebration.
Such an event can be
successfully held in a
restaurant banquet
room, community center,
or school auditorium.
An awards banquet is
an opportunity to honor
the most outstanding
swimmers on the
team, from the very
fastest, to the most
improved, to the most
inspirational, to the
swimmer with the most team spirit. Some teams choose the
recipients of these awards through a write-in ballot by team
members. Some teams give this job to the coach. Being honored in
this way is an extremely special event for an adult athlete.
Some teams create an award for every swimmer on the team,
underscoring the importance of every swimmer’s participation and
effort. This is also the time to honor long-time team members by
giving “5 Year” and “10 Year” awards. Awards for those who have
volunteered their time in team service are also appropriate.
The opportunities for creative awards are endless. Inviting ideas for
special awards from the team for particular swimmers often brings a
very enthusiastic response. Awards can be given for:
• Most, or least, hair in a swim cap
• Best lane partner
• Most likely to swim 200 butterfly
• Best lap counting
• Fastest kicking without fins
A successful awards banquet can be an event that is anticipated
throughout the year and can become a favorite tradition of the team.

TalentShow
This kind of event is designed to encourage swimmers to share more
than swimming with their team mates. It is a very entertaining event
and fascinating to see the array of talents, hobbies and interests
among the swimmers of the team.
Many Swimmers play a variety of musical instruments. They sing and
dance. They show their collections, their artwork, and their prized pets.
They demonstrate cake decorating, orchid cultivation and crocheting.
As swimmers share their “other talent” with the team, they share a
special part of themselves, which is appreciated and supported by the
team as much as the swimming that they already share.
Community Service Day
Some teams choose to make community service a team activity.
Reaching out to the community as a team is great for the community
and great for the team. A group of volunteers can accomplish a great
deal together. A team experiences making a difference together.
It is a very bonding activity. Litter clean up, helping out at a soup
kitchen, planting trees in a community park, painting and doing repairs
at a school are examples of projects that need volunteers. They are all
ways that a team can give back to their community and do so together.
2.6
TEAM IDENTIFICATION
Nothing brings out the sense of team like a team uniform. As in all team
sports, athletes wear their
uniform proudly both at
practice and in competition. A
team in uniform creates a
group identity that is clear to
its own members and to other
teams. Team uniforms are an
important way to build team
spirit. In Masters swimming,
this uniform may be as
simple as a team swim cap.
152

--- Page 153 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 153
The Masters Swim Team
Some teams choose to
have a more extensive
uniform including team
swimsuit, t-shirt, parka and
towel. A team banner is
also an important piece of
team identification that
promotes a sense of team.
When it is hung up at the
home pool, a team banner
in effect, marks territory.
When it is hung up at a
swim meet, it is like a flag
that identifies your team as a distinctive entity among others. A team
banner is a symbol of a unity. Team wear and other team items can be
imprinted with the name of the team or its abbreviation. Many teams choose
team colors. Some teams develop logos and mascots to identify themselves.
2.7
TEAM COMMUNICATION
Team communication is important to keep everyone on the team
informed and connected on matters including workout schedules,
special events, competitions, meetings and team news. Because
most Masters swimmers do not attend workouts everyday,
announcements made at workouts have limited effectiveness. To
make sure everyone knows what is going on with the team,
additional methods of communication should be used. Some
effective ways to communicate with the team include:
E-mail
E-mail has become a popular way for Masters swim teams to
communicate. A regular weekly e-mail is a great way to keep most
members of the team updated. This may take the form of a letter
from the coach, or a simple list of announcements. Electronic
communication is a great way to stay in touch with most team
members but should be regularly updated. It should also be kept in
mind that not everyone has e-mail.

Masters Swimming
Team Newsletter
Many teams publish traditional newsletters. Anewsletter communicates
important information, but even further, it is a way to promote team
spirit and Master’s swimming pride. Articles on the various swimming
successes of team members, as well as stories of interest about
adult athletics and the larger Masters swimming community are
interesting to swimmers. Articles on stroke technique and
conditioning principles are also read eagerly. Some teams use their
newsletter to announce the “Swimmer of the Month.” Photos and
graphic elements give a newsletter even more appeal. Masters
swimmers who do not have access to e-mail will still be informed if
your team puts out a newsletter regularly. Even swimmers with
e-mail will want to have a copy of the team newsletter. Many will be
saved in scrapbooks and sent to relatives and friends.
Bulletin Board
Maintaining an attractive bulletin board at the team’s home pool is a
good way to get information to team members. It is a permanent and
convenient place for team members to get information. The team
bulletin board should be updated regularly with new content to be
effective. If it is an outdoor bulletin board, weathered paper should be
replaced frequently, or current information can appear like “old news.”

Phone Tree
Some teams also use phone trees to pass on information. A phone
tree works when one team member calls three other team members,
who each call three more team members, and so on. This method is
great for making personal contact, which is appreciated by many
people. It also gets the team involved. Sometimes, the process does
not work as designed when people are too busy to do their part.
2.8
MARKETING
Effective publicity is very important for a new team, as well as for an
existing team. Getting the word out about your activities puts your
Masters swimming program “on the map,” enabling new people to
find you. Successful marketing must be directed to those who might
be interested in what you are doing. This requires you to know your
“market,” and to target that audience with your efforts. At its most
basic, the target audience of Masters swimming is the adult
population. More specifically, it can include:
• Lap swimmers and those wishing to improve their swimming
• Triathletes and other athletes looking to cross-train
• Ex-competitive swimmers of all ages
• Those looking for a new fitness routine
• Those looking for camaraderie
• Those who enjoy a team environment
The market for potential new swimmers is quite expansive! This
gives you the opportunity to be creative in your marketing. It is
usually most effective to use a variety of marketing methods at once,
to connect with the most people. Good marketing methods include:
Web site
Many teams maintain a Web site with general information on
practice times and locations. Some teams also include a history of
the team, a bio of the coach, team records, and other distinctive

features about their team. Making sure your team’s Web site has
wide search parameters is important. Key words beyond Masters
swimming and adult fitness will expand the potential audience of
your Web site. Some good key terms include: novice swimmers,
senior fitness, swimming technique, over 18 swim team, competition
and coached workout. There are many others.
Printed Material
Some teams distribute brochures and flyers with workout schedules
in public places that are frequented by people in their target
audience. Good locations include community centers, gyms, sports
stores, cafés and senior centers. It is sometimes necessary to get
permission to distribute, post or leave a stack of material in certain
locations. The brochure or printed piece that you distribute works as
the first impression of your team. Make it good! It should be
attractive and concise. People who see it should be called to action.
They should want to find out more about your team. They should
want to swim! Some teams include a coupon for a free workout in
their printed material. This allows the team to track the effectiveness
of a marketing material and sites of distribution.
Press Releases
Some teams maintain a regular stream of contact with newspapers
and local publications through press releases. Masters swimming is
newsworthy! It is considered a human interest topic. A press release
can highlight a special activity of the team.
It can report on the swimming accomplishments of team members.
It can cover team milestones. In addition to the main topic, each
press release should also include information about joining the team
and contact information. Press releases can be sent to sports editors
and community events editors.
156

The Masters Swim Team
Community Participation
Some teams participate in community events, such as fairs and
parades. A team that is connected to the community can be more
inviting to the average person. Sometimes Masters swimming can be
viewed as an exclusive group, open only to the very best and
experienced swimmers. Being involved in community events is an
opportunity to introduce your team with the more accurate image of
Masters swimming, as an activity open to all adults looking for
swimming fitness. It shows that your team is made up of regular
people. It makes your team more approachable.
The Best Marketing Tool
Probably the most effective means of marketing available to a
Masters swim program has no extra effort or expense associated
with it. It requires no design and printing, no writing skill, and no
special organization. The best form of marketing is word of mouth.
It is carried out spontaneously and with genuine enthusiasm by the
members of the team. The impact of publicity through word of
mouth is unparalleled. Swimmers who enjoy the experience of
Masters swimming with your team, who are happy about their
swimming progress, or who have made friends on the team will talk
about it. This means that marketing becomes a matter of delivering
on your mission statement, having smooth team operations, offering
a great program with a solid schedule of swimming and excellent
coaching. If you make this happen, your program will speak for itself.
2.9
FUNDRAISING
Fundraising is done for many reasons by Masters swim teams.
If dues do not meet expenses, a team may fundraise for its own
survival. Some teams fundraise to help keep the pool they swim
at open through the winter. Some teams fundraise to help the
pool purchase new equipment. Some teams fundraise and
give the proceeds to a community organization. Teams organized as
non-profits can offer tax-deductible receipts to donors. Team
fundraisers can take many forms, including:

Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 158
Masters Swimming
Swim-a-thon
A swim-a-thon is a traditional fundraiser for swim teams. Once an
event date is set, swimmers get sponsors who pledge a dollar
amount for every lap the swimmers will swim in the swim-a-thon
event. The event is often defined as an hour swim, when spectators
are invited to watch the swimmers accomplish their laps.
swim-a-thons require swimmers to actively participate by gathering
sponsors, collecting money, and swimming. Sometimes prizes are
given for the most laps and for the most money raised. With good
participation, a swim-a-thon can be a very successful fundraiser and
a fun event for the team.
Silent Auction
A silent auction is popular fundraising tool for many organizations.
People buy tickets for the opportunity to attend an event where
items of interest are displayed. They bid in writing on items that
interest them over the course of an evening dinner or party-type
gathering. As the silent auction clock runs out, bidding can reach a
fevered pitch! In the end, the highest bidder gets the item. This kind
of event requires a great deal of advance planning, advertising,
ticket sales, as well as the collection of items for the auction.
Some teams ask their members to donate items for auction. Others
approach businesses in the community for donations of auction
items. The quality and value of the items to be auctioned often
determines the success of these kinds of events. If there is a brand
new mountain bike, or set of golf clubs up for auction, it will probably
attract more bidders and higher bids than second-hand items.
Eating Functions
Some teams hold pancake breakfasts, crab feeds or other
family-style meal events where tickets are sold in advance. Events
such as these are best held in school cafeterias or other locations
with large size kitchen setups. The food and supplies can be
158

--- Page 159 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 159
The Masters Swim Team
purchased wholesale or sometimes even gathered by donation.
Increased appeal can be added if a celebrity guest agrees to appear
and sign autographs or make a short speech. Raffles and door prizes
can also be advertised. Teams holding eating functions often have
the greatest success if the event is held annually, as it becomes a
fun family tradition for many ticket buyers. Eating events require a
great deal of teamwork as the ticket sales, preparation, set up,
cooking, serving and clean up are all done by team members.
Yard Sales
One of the easiest fundraising efforts a Masters swim team can take
on is an old fashioned yard sale. Most team members have stores of
treasures in their garages and attics awaiting an event like this! The
combined “stuff” of your whole team makes a very appealing sale to
passersby. To hold a successful yard sale, as well as donating things,
team members must volunteer to transport, sort, display, price and
sell the “stuff” at your yard sale. Working in shifts, no one will be
overworked, and your yard sale will go well.
It is important to secure a location in a high traffic area to get the
best results. Someone on your team might own a business on a
main street with a visible parking lot that he or she could offer for
the event. Advertising your yard sale in local newspapers can also
bring in more shoppers. At the end of the day, remaining “stuff” can
be donated to a local charity.
2.10
DEALING WITH CHALLENGES
Your new Masters Swim Program should be prepared to face
challenges along the way. Some may be just inconvenient glitches
that are easily remedied. However, some may seem insurmountable.
During these times, it is important to keep in mind your motivation
for starting your program and to look at all the positive aspects of
being involved with your team. You must look out for the interests
and future of your team. Your perseverance in hard times will make
your team stronger. Some common challenges include:

Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 160
Masters Swimming
Pool Politics
If you run a swim team, you will encounter pool politics. For some
reason, the otherwise wonderful swim center environment also seems
to be a haven for power plays and personal agendas. Establishing a
good working relationship with the manager of your home pool is
important, as this person makes important decisions affecting your
team and program regarding pool time, budgeting, and staffing,
among other issues. Keeping an open dialogue is essential. If contact
is not coming to you from the pool manager, you should make
contact! Being recognized as a problem solver is key. Work with your
pool manager, not against him or her. Finally, since many pool managers
are focused on “the bottom line,” attendance figures and notes from
satisfied customers are very influential. The popularity of your program
can give you more clout when dealing with pool managers.
Beyond pool managers, your interactions with the various
personalities around the pool are critical. Lifeguards, office staff,
cashiers, even lap swimmers can make you and your team’s
experience at the pool either pleasant or miserable. It is important to
maintain a courteous relationship with everyone around the pool. The
quality and future of your program depends on you being a good
pool citizen, someone who is conscientious and concerned about the
larger pool community, rather than exclusively about the activities of
your own program. When a problem comes up, deal with it directly,
professionally and promptly. Learn the proper channels of the pool
management to follow. Know who is a supporter of your program and
who is not. Be ready to use your skills as a team builder to diffuse
tense situations and turn them around.
Pool Problems
Problems with water temperature, chemical imbalances and no-show
lifeguards can negatively affect your team. Although ensuring a
working and open pool may not be your responsibility, if workouts
are frequently canceled due to these kinds of problems, swimmers
can become discouraged with your team and look for another team.
To prevent this, you must get involved. Have the phone number of the
160

--- Page 161 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 161
The Masters Swim Team
pool maintenance person, the pool manager, and staff with you and do
not hesitate to use them if a problem arises. Become a certified
lifeguard yourself. If you do so, you might have more success in getting
pool keys. Ask the pool staff to call you in advance if there is a pool
problem so you have a chance to move the workout to another pool
and advise your swimmers in advance. In cases where the pool is out
of order frequently, or your team is locked out for another reasons, you
might consider securing another home pool for workouts.
Poor Team Culture
A team culture where a disrespectful attitude toward the coach is
allowed to manifest can be seriously damaging. When the coach is
not seen as a team leader, but as someone who fetches kick boards
and pulls pool covers, something is wrong. This problem can have its
beginnings in the choice of coaches. The job of coaching Masters is
often assigned to unengaged or inexperienced employees. With such
a figure on deck, swimmers get used to the workout having no rhyme
or reason. They get used to little or no technique feedback being
offered. This problem can also develop when a coach’s financial
compensation is very low.
If a coach continually puts in countless hours of unpaid time to make
the program work, his or her enthusiasm may be slowly whittled
away and replaced by the feeling of being taken for granted. The
consequence is less and less energy being put out by the
undervalued coach. Another reason this happens is when a single
athlete insists they know better than the coach on deck, and wants
the coach and the rest of the team to know it too. A coach may give
directions for the next set only to hear one swimmer tell another, “I
am not going to do that. I have a better set.” This kind of disrespect
is not so uncommon. It is contagious. If the coach is seen as an
unimportant, the benefits of a strong coaching presence will not
occur on your team, and a good coach will not stay for long. Your
team will suffer for it. A team culture that values the coach and the
impact of good coaching can make the difference between a
mediocre and a thriving Masters swim program.

Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 162
Masters Swimming
A new coach coming onto a team with such a climate of disrespect
has an uphill climb to turn things around. Some coaches will choose
to walk away from a team with these kinds of dynamics, justifiably
unwilling to accept the inhospitable environment.
The best approach for a coach who chooses to take on the challenge
of this sort of team is to work to gain the trust and support of the
swimmers one at a time. It will take patience, and lots of it. The
swimmers may ignore the new coach, talk over him or her, and
challenge his or her expertise. With perseverance and a strong
vision, a good coach can gain the trust of the team.
2.11
MAKING IT OFFICIAL
Registering Your Team
To become an official Masters swim team, you must register your
team with the Masters swimming organization in your area.
Registering your team is a matter of filling out forms and paying a
nominal fee. Every Masters swim team must be officially registered
with their local Masters swimming committee before athletes can be
registered with the team. Ateam must register each calendar year.
When you register your team, important information, including the
team contacts, safety coordinator and coach’s certifications, is compiled
into the Masters swimming database. Your home pool location and
workout schedule will also be recorded. Upon registering your team,
you will be sent an official Masters swim team package including
a certificate showing that your team is a registered Masters swim team,
a rule book, and insurance information.
An overview of the organization’s functions will also be included,
offering opportunities for your new team to become involved in its
various committees and decision making processes. Instructions on
registering athletes also come in this package.

Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 163
The Masters Swim Team
Registering Your Athletes
Once your team is registered as an official Masters swim team, it is
the team’s responsibility to make sure that every athlete who swims
with the team is a currently registered member of Masters
Swimming. This is very important because the insurance that Masters
swimmers get as a benefit of membership is only valid if
all swimmers are registered. It is not fair to the swimmers who
register as they are supposed to do to have their insurance benefits
voided because another swimmer doesn’t register. Being a registered
Masters swimmer is a requirement that all team members should
be held to. Membership must be renewed each calendar year for
a nominal fee.
Registered swimmers receive a membership card that shows the
current year of registration. Registered swimmers are eligible to
swim in Masters swimming competitions worldwide. They receive
regular updates on Masters swimming news and events through
weekly e-mails, a monthly newsletter, and bi-monthly magazine.
2.12
THE MASTERS NETWORK
Because Masters swimming is truly a worldwide phenomenon, an
extensive network has developed around Masters swimming.
Through both internet connections and personal interaction, this
network provides swimmers with a real sense of being a part of
something big. It also provides an extensive array of Masters
swimming resources.
One of the most used resources is called “Places to Swim,” and it is
a comprehensive listing of Masters swim teams and their workout
times, as well as pools offering lap swim times all over the world.
Swimmers who travel for work, or who go on vacation, can make use
of this resource to keep up their swimming while away from home. It
is also a good resource for swimmers who are planning to relocate.

Masters Swimming
“Places to Swim” is a link that can be accessed through the United
States Swimming website at www.usms.org.
The Masters swimming network online also offers the opportunity for
swimmers to get information on upcoming Masters swimming
competitions, conventions, rule changes, meet results, time
standards, swimming records, history, current news, and other
subjects of interest.
Beyond the internet, the Masters swimming network also exists
through the personal connections made between Masters swimmers.
Swimmers are the best resources for other swimmers in terms of
referrals. Swimmers learn from each other where the best place is to
buy swimming equipment, where to find an early morning workout,
and what the temperature of a certain pool is.
Masters swimmers also use their network to support each other.
They are known to spread the word when a fellow swimmer is ill or
in crisis. They remember each other’s birthdays, which are viewed as
major achievements the older a Masters swimmer becomes.
They actively maintain long-term friendships even if they live on
separate continents.

1 What Masters Swimmers
Think About
Many Masters swimmers look at their swimming as “their own time,”
a special time when they are alone with their thoughts. But what
exactly Masters swimmers think about while they swim is
determined in part by the level of skill and comfort they have
achieved with their swimming technique and conditioning. At first,
thoughts may be cognitive in nature. The swimmer understands, in
theory, what he is supposed to do, and he tries to translate that into
action. Later, thoughts become more associative. Having mastered
individual skills, the swimmer thinks about how to coordinate the
parts. Finally, thoughts evolve to the autonomous level. When the
swimmer is able to swim without thinking about it as a series of
mechanical movements, thoughts can turn to other matters.
Swimming becomes a time where personal matters are processed, plans
are made, and thinking is done, all simultaneously with good swimming.
As an example, a person just beginning Masters swimming may think
about the path of the arm stroke, or the kick, or the breathing as he
or she swims a workout. Then, as this swimmer gains the skill to
perform these individual aspects of the stroke, thoughts change to
more complex concepts including how to coordinate the arm stroke
with the breathing and kick. Then, as the swimmer’s stroke comes
together, while thinking about how to get more leverage out of the
stroke through employing the muscles of their core, their thoughts
might gravitate to reflections of the day at work or making mental
notes on what is needed at the grocery store on the way home from
the workout.
Likewise, with the process of conditioning, at first a swimmer thinks
about how he or she is going to ever make it to the end of the pool,
or how tired his or her muscles are. Then, as adaptation occurs,
166

--- Page 167 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 167
Sticking with It
thoughts include matters of swimming on a regular interval or
attempting longer sets. Finally, as the swimmer reaches a higher
level of conditioning and accomplishing the workout is a “given,”
thoughts include such things as writing an overdue thank you letter
to a friend or having lunch with a swimmer in the next lane.
On the surface, it may seem odd that as swimmer’s technique and
conditioning become better and better, swimming becomes less and
less in the forefront of his or her mind. But in fact, what happens is
that a swimmer’s swimming becomes so integrated into his or her
thoughts and actions that more than one task can be successfully
accomplished at the same time. When a swimmer finds himself or
herself thinking in this manner, it is an indication that a new phase
of swimming has begun. It shows that all the work a swimmer has
done is paying off.

that a swimmer’s swimming becomes so integrated into his or her
thoughts and actions that more than one task can be successfully
accomplished at the same time. When a swimmer finds himself or
herself thinking in this manner, it is an indication that a new phase
of swimming has begun. It shows that all the work a swimmer has
done is paying off.

thoughts include matters of swimming on a regular interval or
attempting longer sets. Finally, as the swimmer reaches a higher
level of conditioning and accomplishing the workout is a “given,”
thoughts include such things as writing an overdue thank you letter
to a friend or having lunch with a swimmer in the next lane.

On the surface, it may seem odd that as swimmer’s technique and

less in the forefront of his or her mind. But in fact, what happens is

Measuring Progress
Staying motivated is probably the single most important factor in
sticking with a swimming program. Most swimmers find that in order
to stay motivated, it is helpful to find ways to periodically measure
their progress. Progress can be defined in many ways, and no one
measure is perfect for everyone. Several options include:
2.1
GOAL SETTING
Setting personal goals is one way swimmers may stay motivated to
keep swimming because goals define a path or purpose that must
be accomplished over time. Goals should be realistic yet challenging.
They are most useful when they do not make swimming into a
pass or fail situation. In other words, avoid defining your goal
by a specific date or other fixed circumstance. Let the goal
be a challenge in front of you to achieve, not a source of stress.
There are short-term goals and
long-term goals. Short-term goals
include personal challenges that
are within reach but require focus
to achieve. They may be steps
along the way toward
a long-term goal. Long-term
goals are larger challenges and
require the swimmer to work on
incremental but steady progress
over an extended period of time.
An example of short-term goals
may be “I will work on improving
my breaststroke kick.” An
example of a long-term goal
could be, “I want to swim a 200
breaststroke well in competition.”

Setting goals and then working to reach those goals is something
that allows us to look at our swimming in terms of more than the
present, but as an activity that will engage us into the future.
2.2
COMPETITION
Masters swimming offers opportunities for competition year round.
Competitions are held at the local, regional, national, and
international levels. Competitions are held in four seasons: short
course yards, long course meters, short course meters and open
water. Participating in competition is an option that is very good for
measuring progress. Unfortunately, many Masters swimmers miss out
on this chance to measure their progress because of the connotation
that competition brings. Competition is something that we all
experience in many aspects of our lives, and for many swimmers,
Masters swimming is viewed as a refuge from the competition of the
rest of their lives.
WhatDoes Competition Mean to You?
Competition can be viewed in two basic ways. It can be seen as
unpleasant and stressful, or as exciting and fun. It can be seen in
terms of winning and losing, or it can be seen as an opportunity to
do one’s best. This distinction separates people who enjoy
competition from people who avoid it.
When a swimmer swims against other swimmers to win, there is a
real chance that it won’t happen because only one person comes in
first, and the other swimmers don’t. Whereas, when a swimmer
swims in the company of other swimmers in order to do his or her
best, coming in first is not necessary to win.
A swimmer is a winner by swimming at his or her own top effort. In
this second view of competition, the swim meet environment is just
an opportunity when official times are taken and where swimming
conditions are ideal. The pressure to come out on top and the
humiliation of not being first are not part of this thinking.

Masters Swimming
Competing in Masters swimming is a unique experience that is a
breath of fresh air to many swimmers. Swimmers begin their race
with friendly support and unexpected encouragement from
swimmers they have never even met, and they finish their races with
applause and repeated congratulations from those same swimmers,
who will never again be considered strangers. It is a very uplifting
experience for most swimmers who try it.
For those Masters swimmers who also swam competitively as kids,
going to a swim meet often yields an additional pleasant experience.
An apparent stranger may approach you and call you by name. After
a perplexed moment, you may
recognize him or her as a
swimmer from your childhood
team who, like you, has returned
to the sport through Masters
swimming. You may not have
seen each other in 15, 20, or 25
years, but an instant kinship is
present. It is wonderful to see
people from your childhood still
involved in swimming. You realize
that swimming has truly impacted
your life. You realize that
swimming together so long ago
was as special to your childhood
teammate as it was to you,
and like you, they are still at it!
WhatCompetition Means to Your Coach
One of the biggest highlights of coaching is watching the swimmers
that a coach has trained swim in a competition. If you are not
motivated to measure your progress at a swim meet, you might
consider going to a swim meet for this reason.
When a swimmer gets up on the block, his or her coach feels the
same butterflies, the same focus, and the same flood of everything
that the swimmer has done to get to this point. It is a very proud
moment for a coach when a swimmer that he or she has worked
with gets up on the blocks.
170

Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 171
Sticking with It
During the race, the coach is thrilled to watch the technique that the
swimmer has developed over time in action! The coach watches as
the conditioning that the swimmer has worked for at practice is
tested under race conditions. The coach watches every aspect of the
race, often with the hair on his or her arms standing on end!
A swimmer looking for motivation to swim in competition might
want to think of the hours that his or her coach dedicates to the
swimmer’s improvement. Your coach stands on the deck with wet
feet in the sun, in the rain, before the sun comes up, and after it
goes down. Your coach is there with you. Going to a swim meet is a
great way to say “thank you” to your coach.
Setting a Benchmark
The first official time that you swim at a swim meet serves as your
benchmark. It gives you a starting point to build from. It will be the
time you use as your entry time for your next meet. At your next
swim meet, by using this time, you will be grouped with swimmers
of your gender who are swimming the same event, at approximately
the same speed as you, often regardless of their age.
171

Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 172
Masters Swimming
The very first time you enter a swim meet, you must enter an
estimated time, which your coach can help you with. An alternative
is to use a workout time off the pace clock as your entry time.
Recording Your Times
Once you have established your first official times in competition,
making a record of them is an excellent idea. Some swimmers have a
diary or swim meet log in which they write down their times, the
dates they swam those times, and sometimes even notes on the
swim, including ways they think they could improve. Some
swimmers create a spreadsheet on their computers with which they
can follow their progress. Many swimmers make it a practice of
swimming every event at least once a year so they can have a
complete history of the progress of their swimming.
Time Standards
If a swimmer becomes involved in ongoing competition, he or she
may want to be aware of certain time standards that are set by
Masters swimming. Some swimmers find it motivating to have a time
standard to reach for.
These time standards include
qualification times to enter
certain Championship meets,
which are usually established
by using the sixteenth
fastest time for a particular
event and age group from
the previous year. There are
“Top 10” lists for regional,
national and international
levels, which a swimmer can
aspire to achieve. There are Masters swimming records kept for
every event and age group, and “All American” lists that can also be
a source of motivation. All of these time standards can be used as
a way to measure a swimmer’s own progress from year to year.

Relays
Sometimes being a member of a relay team in a swim meet is a
good introduction to competing in Masters swimming. Being part of
a relay team takes the focus off any one swimmer, as four swimmers
swim in succession in the same
race. A swimmer feels the close
support of his or her teammates,
and the cheerful atmosphere of a
Masters swim meet, without any
pressure. A swimmer who is
reluctant to compete may be
more inclined to do so for the
team than for himself or herself.
Open Water Swimming
Open water swimming sparks the interest of many people and
motivates some to keep swimming more than in the pool. Even though
water is water, some swimmers see open water swimming almost as a
different sport than pool swimming. In a swim meet, swimmers are
separated by lanes. The water is clean and clear. There is no problem
knowing which way to swim or how much distance is yet to be covered.
The temperature is comfortable. Swimmers get to relax through every
turn. None of this is true when swimming in a lake, the ocean or a
river. For those who love the open water, this is part of the appeal.
In the open water, swimmers have to get used to being cold.
Thinking about the water as refreshing, not cold, works for some
swimmers! To acclimate to cold water, practice swimming in
open water, steadily increasing
time spent in the water. Some
swimmers wear wetsuits. Others
choose to experience the real
thing. But in extreme conditions,
even these “naturalists” wear
a neoprene cap and ear plugs
to insulate the head. In the
open water, limited visibility
makes orientation a challenge.

Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 174
Masters Swimming
Choosing a landmark in advance to “sight” during a swim is a good
idea. Then, by using periodic heads-up strokes swimmers will better
stay on course. Race courses are usually marked by occasional red
buoys but knowing how to navigate is a good skill to learn.
Swimming with plant life and even creatures is an unsettling
experience at first! Thinking about swimming efficiency is a good
distraction. Just ignore what could be going on beneath the surface or
what is watching from down there! There is usually no chance to
warm up and there are no walls to rest on. Swimmers will have to
overcome waves and currents, and because they will be swimming a
mile or more, establishing a sustainable pace is important.
When participating in an open water race, there will be no best
times, as there are in the pool, even when a swimmer has swum the
same distance in the same body of water before. The conditions and
circumstances vary from race to race and from day to day so that
each race is a unique experience.
The infamous mass start leaves some swimmers wondering where to
best position themselves. In some races, hundreds of swimmers
begin the race at the same
time. No one wants to be
last before the race even
starts, and no one wants to
be run over. Those
swimmers out to win
usually start at the front
and center. Those who are
out just have a fun time,
usually start on the outside
and to the rear. Once the race begins, swimmers should expect other
swimmers to crawl over them, to scratch their skin, pull their legs and
push them underwater. This is the way it is in open water swimming.
Drafting is the secret weapon of many successful open water
swimmers. By allowing another swimmer to take a slight lead, the
swimmer drafting is drawn along with the lead swimmer. This allows
174

--- Page 175 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 175
Sticking with It
the swimmer following to save his
or her energy for the sprint at the
finish. If you are among the faster
swimmers in an open water race,
expect to experience drafting. It is
entirely legal. The best open water
swimmers develop strategies to
share the leader’s role in drafting and
know when it is time to break away.
Open water swimming has its own
wonderful appeal. It is always an
adventure, and it offers you the chance
to swim in places other people only
see from afar. From Alcatraz to
San Francisco, across the English
Channel, or to the other side of a local
lake, wherever and whatever you
swim, you can look back with pride
and satisfaction.
2.3
CHALLENGE SETS
Swimmers may want to measure their progress in the workout
environment through challenge sets. While a challenge set may take
many forms, it is meant to be repeated periodically, effectively
tracking a swimmer’s progress over time. Because challenge sets are
done as a part of a workout, they measure a swimmer’s level of
conditioning more directly than their speed.
One of the most popular challenge sets among swimmers and coaches
is “10 x 100.” In this set, the swimmer strives to make each 100 faster
than they swam the previous time they did the set. Or, a swimmer may
be asked to hold the same times with less rest than before.
175

--- Page 176 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 176
Masters Swimming
Another common challenge set is “500 for time.” In this set, a
swimmer’s overall swim time is measured, as well as the “splits” of
each of the successive five 100s. This set is an excellent way to
measure progress in overall endurance and consistency of the
swimmer’s pace.
Some teams get very creative with their challenge sets. A “200 Fly,”
or “3 x 400 I.M. at the end of workout” are challenge sets that
swimmers boast about doing. Some teams schedule a regular time
for challenge sets, like once a month or every Friday. Sometimes
challenge sets are assigned by surprise during a workout. Challenge
sets can be very motivating for the team to do together.
2.4
PHYSICAL CHANGES
Some swimmers notice positive changes in their physical appearance
soon after beginning a Masters swimming routine. These changes
include reduced body fat, improved muscle tone, and weight loss.
These changes are not accomplished through dieting, but through
ongoing physical activity of their Masters swimming routine. Dieting,
in fact is not recommended, especially reduced carbohydrate diets,
because swimming requires a great deal of energy output, and
energy output requires readily available fuel.
Changes to a swimmer’s body continue over time. As the swimmer
gains more conditioning and good swimming technique, the body
becomes more and more efficient at using available energy.
Improvements in a swimmer’s physique are the result of cumulative
swimming. They are a visible measure of a swimmer’s progress.
Body Fat
Swimmers can lose body fat easily with a regular Masters swimming
routine. Losing fat happens when the body uses up the calories that
the swimmer has in immediate fuel and accesses the body’s energy
176

--- Page 177 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 177
Sticking with It
storage, or fat. The body is very efficient at accessing the various
energy sources it has available, but it does so in a particular order.
Some swimmers might wonder, “why not speed up the process by
just not consuming calories, so the fat storage is accessed
immediately?” This idea just does not work. Doing so deprives the
body of the primary energy source it pulls from, especially for
exercise. If calories are not readily available when a swimmer works
out, the body signals itself to go into “starvation mode.” This is a
survival measure of the body that slows down the metabolism of a
person exercising without calories, so that only a bare minimum of
fat storage is used. The body, thinking that it is being starved,
attempts to preserve more fat for later, ensuring that the body can
survive for a longer time.
A swimmer working out in starvation mode will go into a workout
feeling depleted and not have the energy necessary to perform a
workout well enough to make the conditioning process occur. In
addition, fat loss is actually slowed down. For swimmers, consuming
an average 2000 calorie per day diet, fat loss usually happens
without extra measures. It happens while the swimmer is enjoying
his or her swimming.
Fat loss also happens for swimmers in another way. The constant
pressure of the water on the swimmer’s body produces a mild
compression effect. Swimmers notice reduced cellulite with regular
immersion and activity.
All this being said, studies measuring body composition, or
percentage of body fat show that among fit athletes, swimmers are
not generally the leanest athletes. Runners and gymnasts are
generally measured with less body fat than swimmers. However, the
standard methods of measuring body fat do not distinguish between
“white fat” and “brown fat.” While the lean muscle mass of
swimmers is largely the same as those athletes measured with the
least percentage of body fat, swimmers have “brown fat.”
177

--- Page 178 Text ---
Masterswim Satz 12.01.2006 16:43 Uhr Seite 178
Masters Swimming
“Brown fat” is a thin, insulating layer commonly seen in people living
in very cold climates. It is also seen in the cheeks of infants. In
swimmers, the purpose of “brown fat” is generally attributed to
extended periods of immersion in water of a temperature colder than
the average human body temperature. “Brown fat” has a very
beneficial effect for swimmers, beyond insulation. It provides improved
floatation, allowing forward motion with less effort and less drag.
Muscle Tone
Because swimming uses nearly every muscle group in the body,
improvement in muscle tone is noticeable quite quickly. Swimmers
may see more definition in their arms, abdomens and legs. This is a
welcome sight to most adult swimmers!
An added benefit of improving muscle tone is that muscle fiber
carries blood more efficiently than fat, so cardiovascular
improvement happens at a faster rate when muscles are toned. The
consequence is that a swimmer with toned muscles feels more
energetic both in and out of the pool.
Weight Loss
Initially, swimmers may be alarmed to find that their weight actually
increases when they first become involved in a Masters swimming
routine. This happens because muscle weighs more than fat. But as
muscles become stronger, the capacity of the body to do more work
increases, and so more energy is used, causing eventual loss of fat,
and therefore loss of weight.
Weight loss occurs when the body has weight to lose. Swimmers will
usually balance out at a healthy athletic weight. Measuring one’s
progress in swimming should not be a matter of how thin a swimmer
can become, but instead, how healthy and fit he or she can become.

Making a Routine
that Works
Swimming is most rewarding in terms of technique improvements,
progress in conditioning, and enjoyment when it is done regularly.
It is therefore important for every swimmer to find a routine that
works for him or her. Working out an average of three or four times
per week is a good amount of swimming. Creating a working
schedule that includes three to four workouts per week is a very
individual thing. Finding what works might require some trial and
error, but once swimming becomes a real routine, a swimmer will
find that it was well worth it.
3.1
A.M.AND P.M.SWIMMERS
Many swimmers report that they swim better in the morning than the
evening, or better at the end of the day than at the start. Certain
swimmers feel more energetic at specific times in their day. Getting
to know the high and low points of one’s own energy flow can help
establish a routine that makes swimming more rewarding. Trying
both early and late workouts might reveal a definite difference in the
degree of motivation that a swimmer has to come to a workout and
the level of energy he or she has to do that workout. Finding the best
time of day for one’s own body to do exercise can be an important
factor in sticking with a swimming routine.
3.2
LOOKING PAST EXCUSES
During the process of establishing a workout routine, there might be
times when a swimmer is unmotivated to stick to the schedule. At
these times, it is easy to convince oneself that there is a good
reason for not going swimming. Maybe it is “I had to stay up too
late last night,” or “I have to run an errand.” When a swimmer finds
himself or herself coming up with a reason not to swim, it is
important to remember that it might in fact just be an excuse. Try to
recognize what is happening and take a moment to think about it.
Look past today, when you might be feeling a bit tired or sore. Look
toward the day when you are a confident, fit, efficient swimmer.

you always feel better after a workout.

SOLVING PROBLEMS
Sometimes there are real issues that stand between you and your
swimming. Maybe you have no childcare for your baby. Maybe you
have a deadline at work. This is part of life. How you deal with
problems that arise is also a part of life. All swimmers encounter issues
that get in the way of their swimming routine. The way to deal with
them is to become a problem solver. You can’t ignore the
responsibilities in your life in order to swim. You have to find a way to
make it all work. Do what it takes! Become adaptable. Do what you
have to do and swim at an alternate time, or even the next day.
Combine resources with other swimmers, such as babysitting or
carpooling. Don’t give up! It is a major achievement to make it all work.
3.4
GIVE IT THREE WEEKS
Adjusting to the demands of a new workout routine, developing a
routine that works for you, and making your swimming a real part of your
life takes time. It might be tempting during the initial stage to go back to
your old way of life, which probably seems less complicated and easier.
But there comes a time, somewhere around three weeks after you have
started your new fitness routine, when something seems to click.
You notice that swimming becomes significantly easier. You notice that
going to each workout becomes something you look forward to. You
notice that you have developed the ability to get everything done. You
notice that you have made new friends. The challenge is to make it
through those first three weeks. For some new swimmers, it may help to
look at the swimmers beside you, stroking easily through the water,
happy with the balance of health, family and career that they have
achieved. They have reached the point where swimming actually
improves the other aspects of their lives. And without their swimming,
they would feel as if something was missing in their life. You, too, can
get to that point. It is a matter of just three weeks. When you reach this
point, the world of Masters swimming will be a part of you.
