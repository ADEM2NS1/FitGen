"Swimming – A Training Program"sets out 300 swimming schedules and
115 weight schedules making up a single six-month training cycle.
While David Wright's and Garth Gilmour's "Swim to the Top" provided
the training theory, this book sets the theory into practice. Each week's
program, which in most cases involves thirteen swim practices and five
weight sessions, also includes a description of how the week's program
is compatible with and contributes to Lydiard's training objectives.
Chapters include the Aerobic Build-up period, the Transition period,
then the Anaerobic Conditioning period and finally, the most important
of all, the Trials and Coordination race preparation period.
"Swimming - A Training Program" is for the competitive swimmer, but
also less experienced swimmers not yet able to handle the full Lydiard
program will find tips on how to modify the programs to bring them
down to a volume that they can manage. This appeals to young athle-
tes just setting out on their senior competitive careers, recreational
swimmers who swim as part of their fitness program, triathletes, or surf
swimmers using pool work to prepare for their specialist sport.

PRELUDE
P
RELUDE
Our first book, “Swim to the Top” included a prelude that described the
background and experience of Coach David Wright. In “Swimming – A Training
Program” he expands on this with a short story on swimming from the days of
his youth.
T S T P G
O WIMIN HE OOLOFA OD
Not many people have been to Te Reinga. It’s on the inland road between
Wairoa and Gisborne. The main road runs along the coast and has lots of fast
cars. The inland road wriggles up valleys with names like Ruakaturi and along a
river called Hangaroa and around a mountain called Whakapunaki. And where
the Ruakaturi and the Hangaroa meet and right below Whakapunaki, that’s Te
Reinga.
It is maybe a dozen homes, an abandoned trucking business, a three-room
school and a marae. But most important it has the Te Reinga Falls and it is the
home of Hinekorako, the only female God of the Maori.
In 1350 the last of the great waka from eastern Polynesia, Takitimu made
landfall on the coast, east of Te Reinga, at Mahia. The purpose of the expedition
was to introduce the sacred lore of Hawaiki to Aotearoa. Atua or deities had
been captured in wood and stone and were brought to Aotearoa in the waka.
One of the atua was Hinekorako. Initially she lived with her people on the
marae at Te Reinga. She married and agreed to become a mother on the
condition that her husband would always tend to the baby. This was not work for
a god. One day during an important meeting of marae elders, he refused and
Hinekorako left him and dived into the falls and lives in the cave beneath them
to this day.
This might seem like the dull and dusty remnants of myth and fable, but to me it
was once very important. You see I was raised in Te Reinga and I was obsessed
with swimming. These were the days when O’Brien and Berry from Australia
and Scholander from the United States were winning the Olympic Games and
Chapman, Shripston and Whittelston represented New Zealand. Cook Strait

was still waiting to be swum and Hawke’s Bay boasted New Zealand’s best
swimmers, Palmer, Christie, Meade, Todd and Coutts. I trained in the river just
above the Te Reinga falls and raced my mates across its thirty meters. Winning
depended on how quickly you could get your feet out of the mud at the start. If
only they had needed that skill at Mexico City.
Just as important, many years earlier as Hinekorako left the marae for the last
time, she said no male would be a warrior unless he could swim the full length
of the narrow channel below the Te Reinga Falls and climb the rock to her cave
home. This was difficult, the wide river above the falls narrowed to a rapid ten-
meter wide, one hundred and fifty meter long torrent below the falls. Swimming
against the current was only the first problem. It was then necessary to swim
under the huge volume of falling water and climb the rock. The return journey
didn’t appear too tough, slide down the rock and rest as the current carried you
along the narrow channel and out into the big lake at the end.
As the years went by I swam for Hawke’s Bay and won the Auckland and
Wellington Winter Swimming Championships. I was second to the New Zealand
Champion twice across Lake Taupo, and had won the popular Lake Wiritoa
swim. But I had never swum the Te Reinga Falls. Worse, I had looked at it
several times and had determined before getting near the water that the swim
was impossible. Twice I got into the water but gave up as I felt the pressure of
the current and saw the blackness of its depth.
And then in the summer of 1968 I flew to Australia and trained with Don Talbot.
I swam with and talked to his Olympic Champions and world record holders.
The distances we swam were modest by today’s standards but for me they were
immense. Back in Te Reinga I looked again at the Te Reinga Falls. Surely now I
could meet Hinekorako’s challenge. I was lucky, 1968 had been a dry summer
and the volume of water was lower than normal – perhaps, tomorrow.
Donald came with me and we climbed down the bush path to the end of the
channel. We sat for a while on the rock ledge and discussed strategy. Goggles
were a new thing in those days and I would wear them. I would swim on the left
because a rock at the top of the channel made the current weaker on that side. I
got into the water and wondered why swiftly flowing water always seemed
colder than gentle currents. Like wind, does water have a chill factor?

PRELUDE
The first portion of the swim was remarkably easy. I could see the stone bank
passing by quite quickly and the effort was not great. Donald had told me to
watch for the rock that broke the current but I forgot and swam into it. The
current on the other side was much faster. Now it was hard work. But you know
how in a race there sometimes is a moment when the brain says,” I’m going to
do this.” Well that’s what it was like at Te Reinga. I reached the edge of the
falling water and swam in underneath. The weight of water was similar to a
breaking wave and pushed me under. It did not take long though and I was on
the other side, behind the veil of a God. The climb to the cave was easy and
soon I sat on the doorstep of Hinekorako’s home.
Now, do you want to know two really silly things?
Hinekorako said, you became a warrior
completing that swim and just for a couple of
minutes, sitting behind the waterfall, she was
right. And second, ever so occasionally when I
see Thorpe or Klim or Huegill or Hackett
breaking a world record or winning a world title, I
hear a little voice asking, ”Ah, but could they
swim the Te Reinga Falls?”

OWTO SETHE OOKANDITS CHEDULES
Our first book “Swim to the Top” describes how Lydiard’s system of training can
be applied successfully to competitive swimming. It is a general book that
addresses the principles of the swimming program. It does not however detail
the schedules involved in putting Lydiard’s principles into practice. This second
book, “Swimming – A Training Program” takes the next step. It sets out the 300
swimming schedules and 115 weight schedules making up a single six-month
training cycle.
To be most effective “Swimming – A Training Program” should be read in
association with “Swim to the Top”. One provides the training practice and the
other the training theory. However, for readers who have not been able to access
a copy of “Swim to the Top” each chapter in “Swimming – A Training Program”
begins with a summary of the theory supporting the schedules that follow. Each
week’s program, which in most cases involves thirteen swimming schedules and
five weight schedules, also includes a description of how the week’s program is
compatible with and contributes to Lydiard’s training objectives.
There is no reason why experienced swimmers cannot follow the schedules
exactly as they are included in the book. A better way, however, is to look at
what each schedule is trying to achieve and how it does it, and then swim either
the schedule suggested or some modified version that better suits the swimmer.
Before making a change, make sure the principle behind the schedule is not
being compromised. Turning a long aerobic conditioning workout into a series
of 25m sprints or a kick session into a medley workout will upset the balance of
the recommended program and the swimmer’s final result.
Don’t use the schedules like one coach who rang me and said he wanted a
”Lydiard training session.” I asked him why he wanted just one session. Training
programs do not work that way. Each session needs to relate to every other
session so that the season forms an integrated whole. Wednesday’s training
needs to take into account the training done on Tuesday and planned for
Thursday. Week Five’s training needs to take into account the training done in

Week Four and planned for Week Six. Each individual session needs to reflect
and assist in achieving the season’s main competitive goal. He told me that all
the different training ideas were confusing him, so he had decided he would get
a Lydiard type schedule from me for Monday’s training, an interval session from
a specialist interval coach for Tuesday and so on through the week. His squad
would be getting a balanced portion of everybody’s ideas – it just had to work. I
couldn’t believe it so I just gave him Week Five’s Saturday morning Waitakeres
session. All that was a couple of years ago now and I haven’t heard of a host of
champions coming from his squad, so I guess his idea of a balanced program
needs to be reviewed.
The next few chapters address the training schedules involved in each of the
race preparation stages of a Lydiard program. For example the next chapter
covers the Aerobic Build-up period: the following chapter, the Transition period,
then the Anaerobic Conditioning period and finally, the Trials and Coordination
period. The table below shows the number of swimming and weight training
schedules included in “Swimming – A Training Program” for each of these
periods.

manage. How this is best done will depend on whether swimmers are less
experienced because they are young athletes just setting out on their senior
competitive careers or recreational swimmers who use swimming as part of their
fitness program or triathletes who have to allocate training time to three
disciplines or surf swimmers using pool work to prepare for their specialist sport.
The demands and requirements of each category are very different. To assist in
adapting the competitive pool schedules in this book, I have included
suggestions at the end of each week’s training notes on how they can be
modified for younger swimmers, recreational swimmers and triathletes. For
example, should the number of repetitions or the length of each repetition be
reduced. The answer is you can usually do either, but the notes will give you
guidance.

THEBUILD-UPSCHEDULES
C O
HAPTER NE
T B - S
HE UILD UP CHEDULES
The function of a build-up is widely misunderstood. It is a period of training that
is not distance, stroke or race specific. It is equally relevant to 50m or 1500m
freestyle or 200m butterfly. An analogy might help clarify its purpose.
Companies involved in the forestry industry can operate in one of two ways.
They can cut down trees to be used in their mills without replanting the forests
behind them. While they are cutting, the mills work well and profits are high.
Eventually the trees are all cut, the resources have been used and the mills
close. A prudent company however plants one and a half hectares of new trees
for every hectare cut. When the first company is closing the other has more
resources than when it started. Short-term profits have been reduced by the cost
of replanting, but without it there is no long-term business. Swimming is the
same. The build-up is the swimmer’s time of replanting. It is the period in which
athletes increase their resources – resources that are equally beneficial whether
the swimmer competes over 50m, 200m or 1500m.
Like the forestry company analogy the value of a build-up is not immediately
apparent. Real deep-seated benefits take time to evolve. Over five or six
seasons however they produce results their “clear-felled” peers will not be able
to match. Be very aware, however, that results in the early seasons may take
longer to show than aggressively sprint trained competitors. Build-up
conditioning is not the fastest way of achieving fine results. In fact it is often quite
slow. It is, however, the best way to achieve the best results.
The table below summarizes the daily distances making up each week’s build-
up schedule. The weekly mileage has been set at 100 kilometers. Experience
has shown this produces similar physiological demands on a swimmer as 100
miles per week does on a runner. It is a distance that is taxing, but can still be
managed at speeds close to the top aerobic range. If the distance swum each
week is much below 100km it can be swum at good aerobic speeds but is not
taxing enough to achieve the finest aerobic development. If the distance is too
long, the swimmer’s speed reduces to a plod and again aerobic conditioning

suffers. The ideal distance is the maximum that can be swum at the athlete’s
best possible aerobic pace. All individuals are different and therefore the best
distance will vary from swimmer to swimmer. In general, however, 100km each
week appears to be a good best average. However, I can well imagine some top
athletes, especially women swimmers completing 120+km per week at the
required effort. The table also shows the timing of Week Five’s weight training
sessions. The weight training days can be varied if some other timetable suits
the swimmer better.

THEBUILD-UPSCHEDULES
Codes
mr Sessions whose main purpose is to aid recovery from the week’s harder
swims. None of this swimming should be hard and is broken up to include
a mixture of kicking, swimming, pull and drills.
k Sessions where the emphasis is on kick sets. In a 7.5km session up to 4km
is done as kick with fins.
l These are key sessions of long, firm aerobic swimming. In a 10km session
2km should be warm-up, 2km should be warm-down and 6km should be
firm aerobic swimming of repetitions between 500m and 3000m.
m Sessions where the main emphasis is on medley swimming. Medleys can
range in length from 100m up to a build-up favorite 4000m.
hl “Hill” sessions of 25m repeats with 25m easy between for technique
development. Swimmers must not sprint this session. Good technique is the
session’s purpose.
w “Waitakeres” usually 100x100m or similar. The session has the same
aerobic conditioning purpose as the long sessions.
Note
The recomended weight program involves twenty-four seperate exercises
divided into four groups of six exercises. The swimmer starts with Session One
and works through to Session Four before returning to Session One again. This
allows four or five days rest between repititions of the same group of exercises –
an important factor in improving strength and avoiding weight training injuries.

a mixture of kicking, swimming, pull and drills.

Sessions where the emphasis is on kick sets. In a 7.5km session up to 4km
is done as kick with fins.

These are key sessions of long, firm aerobic swimming. In a 10km session
2km should be warm-up, 2km should be warm-down and 6km should be
firm aerobic swimming of repetitions between 500m and 3000m.

Sessions where the main emphasis is on medley swimming. Medleys can
range in length from 100m up to a build-up favorite 4000m.

“Hill” sessions of 25m repeats with 25m easy between for technique
development. Swimmers must not sprint this session. Good technique is the
session’s purpose.

“Waitakeres” usually 100x100m or similar. The session has the same
aerobic conditioning purpose as the long sessions.

--- OCR from Page 18 Image 2 ---
The recomended weight program involves twenty-four seperate exercises
divided into four groups of six exercises. The swimmer starts with Session One
and works through to Session Four before returning to Session One again. This
allows four or five days rest between repititions of the same group of exercises —
an important factor in improving strength and avoiding weight training injuries.

SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
NOTES TO WEEK ONE SCHEDULES
Several schedules in the build-up, such as those on Monday, Friday and Sunday
are recovery sessions where the good is in the mileage swum, mileage for
mileage’s sake. That’s not a politically correct thing to say about a training
program. Today everything has to have more meaning than that. Well in this
case, there is nothing wrong with clocking up kilometers just for the aerobic
benefit kilometers provide. Swimmers used to a seven days per week distance
conditioning program find these days aid
recovery more than a day off. After a day off,
swimmers start the following day stiff and sore.
Their muscles are still feeling the effects of the
long taxing swims. It takes them a further day
of swimming just to loosen up again.
Too Much catch-up
Nicole demonstrates a typical catch-up stroke –
where the recovery arm catches up with the
pulling arm. I prefer the 180 degree alternating
stroke.
180 apart
Nicole demonstrates the 180 degree
alternating stroke. This is the freestyle I prefer.
The key 10km “long” sessions are swum on
Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. They are the
swimming equivalent of Lydiard’s long two-
hour runs. The main sets should be timed and
the times recorded to be compared with the
same main sets when they are swum again in the second five weeks of the
build-up. Remember, although the sets are timed, they must be swum
aerobically. Going anaerobic may produce impressive training times but
contributes little to the aerobic objectives of the build-up.

THEBUILD-UPSCHEDULES
Saturday morning’s training is the week’s third 10km “long” session and in
recognition of its Lydiard origins is called the Waitakeres. This was the range of
hills in the west of Auckland where each week Lydiard tested his runners over a
rugged 22-mile circuit. Every Saturday’s “Waitakeres” session is based around
100m repetitions that culminate in Weeks Five and Nine with 100x100m with a
15 seconds interval. The length of the rest is based on research done on runners
in Finland that established a rest of 15 seconds or less did not affect the aerobic
nature of the session. It avoids the 100x100m becoming a session of hard
anaerobic repetitions. 100x100m done this way
is physiologically the same as a 10km straight
swim.
Hand Paddles
Nicole demonstrates the use of hand paddles – a
useful tool for improving swimmers arm strength
and correcting some faults such as slipping.
Kicking
Nicole finishes another length kick. Spend time
on conditioning a swimmer’s kick. If a swimmer’s
kick fails, the rest of the stroke will soon follow.
Saturday afternoon’s session is important because
it sets aside time specifically for stroke correction.
Stroke correction should be part of every training
session. When faults are detected they should be
corrected irrespective of whether stroke correction is mentioned in the schedule.
Nevertheless it is good to set aside one session each week when time is specifically
allocated to stroke correction. It means once a week both coach and swimmers
are obliged to specifically address the question of technique. It should ensure
faults do not carry on by default.
25

Swimming 02.02.2004 7:49 Uhr Seite 26
SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
Don’t correct stroke characteristics just because they look odd. Evaluate whether
what looks like a fault actually matters. Frequently some quite odd-looking
things don’t affect the swimmer’s efficiency – if the swimmer feels comfortable
swimming that way, leave it alone. One of my best sprinters, Nichola
Chellingworth, had a strange kink in her wrist when she recovered her left arm
swimming freestyle, but her hand entered the water normally. The only reason
for changing it would have been to avoid having to constantly respond to well
meaning onlookers asking, ”Why does Nichola have that strange kink in her
wrist?” Evaluate what is a stroke fault and what is just a stroke idiosyncrasy and
correct the faults.
Sunday’s single swimming session includes two sets of 20x50m, which at first
may appear quite contrary to Lydiard’s principles of build-up conditioning.
However, they are included as an extension of Saturday’s stroke correction
tuition. Swimming these 50m slowly provides an opportunity to drill Saturday’s
technique lesson.
This week sees the first weight training
sessions of the new season. Be cautious
about the amount of weight lifted. The
purpose of weight training at this stage is
just to get the body back into weight
training condition. There is plenty of time
to load up the weights. Doing so too early
could cause injury and will almost certainly
leave the swimmer unnecessarily stiff and
sore. To start with, lift weights the swimmer
feels are too light. Even then swimmers
may be a little stiff from the early sessions.
The happy thought is that this will
probably get worse for two or three days
before muscles adjust to the new season’s
training. A little stiffness should not be
used as a reason for missing training.
Annie and Fara
Annie and Fara complete an eight
kilometer sea swim. These events are
terrific conditioning for pool swimmers

THEBUILD-UPSCHEDULES
Each weight exercise should be done as three sets of seven repetitions with the
exception of sit-ups, which should be done as a single set of 500. I arrived at
seven repetitions after experimenting for several years with repetitions of
between three and twenty. The number that contributes most to the swimmer’s
strength is seven. Fewer repetitions than this generate good strength gains, but
produce too much muscle bulk. More than seven repetitions and the weight
lifted needs to be reduced with corresponding lower strength gains.
Sunday’s weight training session is the beginning of the second cycle of weights.
Swimmers can now increase the weights lifted by increasing each exercise by
one weight increment. For example, in our local gym the dumb bells increase in
weight in two-kilogram increments. If a swimmer has done flies with 24
kilograms in cycle one, I would increase this to 26 kilograms in cycle two. For
those exercises involving machine weights, our gym’s machines increase their
weights in seven-kilogram increments. A swimmer lifting 42 kilograms in cycle
one should aim to lift 49 kilograms in cycle two.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
A full Lydiard program is not intended for junior pre-teen swimmers setting out
on their swimming career. At this stage swimming should be only one of a range
of activities. Swimming the schedules in this book allows time for sleep and
school or part-time work but can not accommodate anything like the diversity
that should be part of a young pre-teen’s life. Children should be allowed the
time to be children. Their lives should be full of diverse and interesting activity. If,
however, a swimming career based on a Lydiard training program becomes an
athlete’s thing, it will be done better looking back on an early childhood that
involved lots of other interests. It’s a choice between an athlete who thinks,” The
only thing I’ve ever done is swim.” or, “I tried heaps of things but the one I liked
best was swimming.” It’s fairly certain which will give the best result.

NOTES TO WEEK TWO SCHEDULES
Swimmers are usually feeling quite pleased with themselves at this stage. They
have got through the first week and 100kms are safely stored away. The real
trick in a Lydiard program, however, is that its effects are cumulative. After the
first week, “I’m feeling quite good.” After the second week, “I’m feeling pretty
tired.” By week three,”I don’t think I’m going to make this.” and in week four,”
I’m definitely not going to make this.” Then in week five or six,”This is beginning
to feel a bit better,” and by week ten, “No problem, piece of cake. Don’t know
what all the fuss was about.” And you know what; your aerobic base has just got
a whole lot better than it was ten weeks ago. So when you’re going through the
pretty awful stage, hang in there, it will come right. The other thing all this
highlights is you have to do the ten weeks. One week is easy. In fact it amuses

me the Clubs that go away for a one-week training camp and swim 100kms.
Lydiard did not arrive at the figure of ten weeks aerobic conditioning by chance.
He arrived at it because that’s what it takes.
Tuesday afternoon’s training is the fourth “long” session. A variety of repetition
distances, making up the six kilometers of the main set, have been selected based
on the principle that the swimmers general aerobic condition will be best
improved by experiencing a range of aerobic experiences. Generally, the Tuesday
sessions contain shorter repeat distances, the Thursday sessions, longer distances
and the Saturday sessions, the 100m. The table below shows the pattern of the
repeat distances in these “long” sessions throughout the build-up period.

SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
Wednesday is a recovery day, after Tuesday’s strenuous efforts and before
Thursday’s next “long” session. The 50m distances included in the Wednesday
morning session are not sprints. They are there as technique swims. A lot of time
should be spent on drilling the rate and size of a swimmer’s stroke. Good
swimmers should be able to swim any asked for number of strokes to a 25m or
50m length. It is a skill that must be automatic and accurate. It is a fundamental
measure of the swimmer’s control over their trade. The 50m distances are
included in order that swimmers can hone this skill. Experiment by asking the
swimmer to complete lengths in different numbers of strokes. Very soon they will
begin to take great pride in their ability to control their swimming to exactly the
number and effort of strokes required. It is worthwhile stressing again that in the
recovery swims it is important swimmers observe the meaning of the word
recovery – take it easy. Don’t feel you’re doing even better by going hard in a
recovery session. Progress is a matter of stress followed by recovery. Short
change either and your results will suffer.
Thursday’s training involves a kick session in the morning and the week’s
second “long” session in the afternoon. Much of the kick training in the build-up
is done using fins. Fins are a valuable tool for strengthening a swimmer’s kick,
especially their ankles. In this respect fins contribute even to breaststroke where
strong ankles add greatly to the final snap of the breaststroke kick. Swimmers
should not purchase the small, trendy fins so admired in some swim squads. If
you are going to kick with fins that small, you might as well save yourself the
money and kick with bare feet. Buy the medium size fins, the ones that have a
fin around 40cms long and are usually the cheapest in the shop. A pair of fins
should last one 1000km build-up. Their life expectancy can be extended by
taping the foot portion of the fin with elastic electrician’s tape.
No one coached by me has ever used a pull buoy. The swimming shown in
these schedules, as pull should be done just with hand paddles or with hand
paddles and ankles strapped together. Pull buoys make swimming easier when
the purpose of doing pull is to make swimming harder. Even worse, pull buoys
actually encourage a lazy body position. Lifting their hips up, in every stroke, is
something swimmers must do for themselves, not lie on a hunk of polystyrene. I
once saw a squad doing pull with both hand paddles and fins. Now that really
is crazy. The two accessories contradict each other. So when you are swimming
pull, use your hand paddles, maybe tie your ankles together but throw your pull
buoy out and leave your fins on the pool deck.

Weights on Friday this week are the first session of the third cycle. Having
increased the weights lifted by one increment in the second cycle, I usually do
not increase the weight again in this third cycle. The next four sessions
consolidate the heavier weights lifted in the second cycle. In the weight
program, the same exercise, pull down front, appears to be repeated twice. This
is not the case. In session two, the bar should be held with an over-the-top-of-
the-bar grip. In session three this should change to an under-the-bar grip. The
change sounds small but it changes completely the muscle groups exercised.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Swimming training in the “pre-Lydiard” early years should also involve more
diversity each day or each week than is characteristic of the Lydiard program.
Time should be spent on starts, turns, steady swims, short sprints, drills, stroke
correction and kick. The important and defining characteristic of swimming in
these years is diversity – constructive play. Young swimmers benefit from being
subject to a wide range of swimming experiences. Water skill drills such as otter
and rock-n-roll are important. Otter involves diving to the bottom of the pool
coming up, rolling over before diving back to the bottom again. Rock-n-roll is
swimming down the pool doing one stroke backstroke followed by one stroke
freestyle. Don’t be afraid to set some longer swims. I’ve seen young squads do
up to 3000m straight swims. They usually love complaining about it and then
travel home telling their parents how great they are. The straight swims are very
valuable. They begin establishing the physiological and psychological
foundation necessary to tackle the full Lydiard program.

NOTES TO WEEK THREE SCHEDULES
You will have noticed by now that the build-up
includes quite a bit of medley swimming. Medleys
are a valuable aid to achieving well-rounded
conditioning, irrespective of the athlete’s
competitive specialty. To quote the Australian, New
South Wales, Swimming Almanac, medleys
promote “skill development in all four strokes,
encourage overall muscle development, give
swimmers more options in their swimming careers
and teach new skills and drills.” They are a
foundation from which great things can accrue.
Hand over back Probably the world’s most
common drill.

Thursday morning’s training emphasizes kick. The
3000m straight kick provides leg muscles with the
same general aerobic conditioning that swimming
provides the shoulders, arms and back. Do not
neglect good leg conditioning. Race results will be
seriously affected if swimmer’s legs are unable to
maintain the race rhythm throughout the event.
Thursday afternoon’s program is a further “long”
10km session. Recording the times taken for these
swims means the results can be compared with the

season. If proof of the validity of the Lydiard
conditioning program was ever needed, it is in the
improvement swimmers will see in the speed of
these swims. It is worthwhile emphasizing again
that these swims must not be swum anaerobically.
Proper conditioning requires they are swum as firm
aerobic efforts. The swimmer’s heart rate should
be kept in the range of 130-150bpm and certainly
held below 160bpm. Do not, however, become a
heart rate monitor slave. In time, swimmers

You can see that although the swims are aerobic
they are not exactly slow. Lydiard is often credited
with being the father of the “long slow distance
method” of training. He was not. Just try and
swim 2 x 3000m in 36.28.00 for each 3000m.
That’s not slow. And yet to a well-conditioned
swimmer it is still an aerobic effort. For
anaerobically over-trained athletes, swims such as
these would be impossible aerobically and maybe
anaerobically as well. In this principle lies the
reason our runners can’t get anywhere near the
African athletes. It’s called aerobic conditioning.

“The only thing swimming 100kms does is make you good at swimming
100kms” or even better, quote Nike at you with, “Go hard or go home.” What
they ignore or just don’t understand is that
aerobically well-conditioned swimmers are often
training at higher speeds aerobically than their
swimmers can anaerobically. They are just not
killing themselves doing it.
Saturday’s training consists of a normal session of
“100m” in the morning and the stroke correction
session in the afternoon. Even during the build-up
the stroke correction session each week includes a
set of drills. The table below lists the drills making
up the 500m set. They should be swum in this DragEmphasizes the shoulder

Done this way, the drills form a mini stroke
correction lesson. If the drills have been taught
properly and the swimmer knows the reason for
doing each drill, the very process of swimming one
length of each drill reminds the athlete of the
important elements of all four strokes. If a
swimmer discovers a new drill that emphasizes
something important, then it should be added to
the drill routine. Two drills to stay clear of are One

Catch-up freestyle used to be very popular until
Popov, de Bruin and one or two other not too bad
scholars of the freestyle trade discovered that
alternating freestyle, which is where the arms pull
and recover 180 degrees apart, is faster. It is
better not to use a drill that is out of date.
Some caution should be exercised when copying

When we came back from an overseas visit with a

However just for fun, Toni Jeffs and I decided to try
an experiment. For a week Toni included, in her

means but know what they’re for before inflicting them on some poor soul in a

YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Introducing young swimmers to a Lydiard
conditioning program is a daunting prospect for
both coach and swimmer. It needs to be
approached recognizing that additional mileage
can only be introduced at a pace each swimmer
can handle. That’s true of course even for older
athletes swimming this program for the first time.
The problem is there is no rule. Some young
people seem to be able to absorb the work
involved in swimming these distances quite
quickly. A few might never make it. Whatever the

NOTES TO WEEK FOUR SCHEDULES
It may have been noticed by now that a number of schedules are the same or
close to the same each week. I make no apology for this. Far too much effort in
swimming goes into inventing different schedules just for the sake of having a
different schedule. I am aware of a number of coaches who take great pride in
never having set the same schedule twice. However, if a schedule is ideal for
recovery or stroke correction or aerobic conditioning then why not repeat it
through the build-up. It is, after all, only ten weeks and if a top athlete can’t do
the same schedule ten times each six months then he or she doesn’t deserve to
be an even better athlete. Jane Copland has got to the stage where she can tell
you the schedule to be swum every day throughout the ten weeks. Far from
being boring, this knowledge provides swimmers with a sense of certainty. They
know what’s expected and can get on with the task of doing it. My attitude

towards this question is colored by the years spent coaching runners. True,
runners do have the variety of the wide outdoors but many of them run the
same ten-mile course day after day week after week without appearing to suffer.
The point is, if you have a good schedule for some purpose, stick to it. Good
swimmers won’t mind at all.
Monday afternoon’s training includes a 1000m butterfly. Long butterfly swims
need to be swum with caution. The butterfly technique can very quickly deteriorate
when the stroke is swum for any great distance. Tiredness can cause the legs and
hips to sink and the whole thing becomes most depressing indeed. When this
happens there is no point in continuing the swim. Don’t practice something that is
clearly wrong. Fitting in two or three lengths of fly drills can however continue the
swim. Once the swimmer has recovered, full butterfly can begin again.
One aspect of breaststroke training included in these programs deserves special
mention. The kick is a most important part of the breaststroke. When it is being
swum in training, a lot of attention should be paid to the distance per kick. A
good female breaststroke swimmer should be able to kick 25m in five kicks and
drop that still further by holding the glide.
A key feature of the modern breaststroke kick is a strong upsweep of the
swimmer’s feet as they come together at the end of each kick. This powerful
upsweep should be practiced constantly. It is an indispensable ingredient of
good breaststroke swimming. Anyone doubting this should look at the
underwater shots of Kovacs, Poewe and Kowal at the Sydney Olympic Games.
They are all good at it. Kovacs is the best, but I guess she should be; she did win
the race. The key point is that there is a strong upsweep, but no downward kick.
That means the kick is legal. The rules say no downward dolphin kick is
permitted and there isn’t any. Unfortunately, many New Zealand officials are
years behind the rest of the world and haven’t realized that at the end of a
breaststroke kick the feet can sweep up without kicking down. Jane Copland
was disqualified in Auckland for this by a referee who clearly had no idea what
he was on about. At a National Swimming Championships held shortly after
that, a group of officials sneaked down to the underwater viewing windows to
inspect just Jane’s new, for New Zealand, kick. Fortunately I was good mates
with one of the pool attendants who told me the officials were under the pool
trying to find something in the kick to disqualify Jane. I went to the Meet Director
who had been leading the posse and said,”What’s going on?” She looked like
57

Swimming 02.02.2004 7:49 Uhr Seite 58
SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
she’d been caught with her hand in the cash till, which, in a manner of speaking
I suppose she had. It never happened again.
One of the disadvantages of living in a small, relatively isolated country like
New Zealand is the lack of exposure many aspects of life get to the educating
influences of the outside world and swimming officials are no exception. Since
she was twelve years old, Jane Copland has swum 430 races. Almost exactly
half (212) have been swum overseas in a combined total of 50 visits to 16
different countries. The balance of 218 have been swum in New Zealand.
Overseas she has been disqualified once and in New Zealand ten times. Now
the one thing you could bet the house on is that her swimming did not change.
Her breaststroke in Imperia, Italy was exactly the same as in Napier, New
Zealand. Why, then was she 1000% more likely to be disqualified in Napier
than in Imperia? New Zealand’s officials would probably claim it was because
Italian officials let their swimmers get away with blue murder. I don’t believe
that’s true. I believe the attitude and the knowledge of swimming, of New
Zealand officials is poor. The attitudes of the majority exhibit the liberal leanings
of a Tianimun Square traffic cop.
The principle step required to correct this is to educate New Zealand officials
that their task is not to search for errors in the best traditions of a police state,
but to facilitate the smooth conduct of a race, a swim meet and a sport.
Australian officials are very good at this. They say a sport gets the athletes it
deserves. The Australians have and so have we.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Although patience is the key to successfully introducing young swimmers to
Lydiard type conditioning I have frequently been amazed by the resilience of
young people. One squad I coached in the United States, Virgin Islands took
just four months to move from a traditional 25 kilometers a week interval
program to 100 kilometers per week Lydiard type conditioning. These were
experienced swimmers of 16 and 17. Nevertheless, it does show how quickly
the transition can be made. The table below shows the weekly distance swum by
three of these swimmers in their first build-up and after just four months. It
should be noted that Branden was only 13 years old when he swam these
distances.

Younger swimmers of 11 or 12 years of age, making the change from the junior
squads, will take longer than the squad in the Virgin Islands. As a rule of thumb,
I expect the process to take about two years. In other words, a 12 year old
leaving the junior squad would normally be capable of swimming the full
Lydiard program in this book by the age of 14. Jane Copland made the
transition quite quickly. She began when she was 12 and swam her first week of
100 kilometers when she was 13. She managed her first four or five consecutive
weeks when she was 14.

NOTES TO WEEK FIVE SCHEDULES
You have just completed half the build-up. It hasn’t been that bad. The weeks
are getting easier; the soreness is not quite as great. You still don’t feel like an
all night party, but at least you now feel you can finish the ten weeks. There will
be some bad moments in the next five weeks, but generally the second half will
be easier. In fact there will be fantastic moments when you start swimming and
feel you can go faster and faster, further and further with no need to stop, with
no chance of ever getting tired. It’s almost an out of body experience, “Who is
this swimming this fast? It can’t be me. It is me. Amazing!” At that moment –
and it will happen, it always does – you will have joined the clan known as
Lydiard trained athletes. You will know for certain the training works. You will
know you are going to race faster than you ever have before. No question.
On Saturday you will swim the first 100x100m with 15 seconds
rest. It is a long and very tough session and yet as it gets easier
and you get faster it begins to stand out as a benchmark of the
improvement in your aerobic condition. The table opposite
shows the progress in Jane Copland’s 100x100m times since
she was 12 years old through to when she was 17 and broke
her first New Zealand open women’s breaststroke record. Jane’s
improvement is shown not because it represents the final word
in freestyle swimming but because it does demonstrate the
progress in aerobic conditioning that will occur by following a
Lydiard training program.
Cycling Brandendemonstrates cycling. I now have swimmers end every dry land
session with 15 minutes of cycling. It’s a good aerobic exercise and very good for
swimmer’s legs.

Jane’s progress also highlights the early age at which long distance training can
be undertaken. Research at the International Center for Aquatic Research in the
USA reveals that “aerobic development is the first factor to reach full
development at about 14 years” and that prior to this age “the primary energy
system is endurance, with the prepubescent swimmer having very little
anaerobic capacity. Therefore endurance training should begin
early and reach a peak in training emphasis by age 14. This
approach avoids training designed to highlight a factor not near
full development (i.e. anaerobic characteristics) when no
adaptation is possible in that system.” So there you have it,
aerobic conditioning not only does no harm to young
swimmers, it is the only type of training from which immature
athletes are physiologically capable of deriving any benefit. And
yet we have always known this.
The stories of young Kenyan children running to and from
school have been around for years. It doesn’t seem to have hurt
their competitive results. Why then do so many swimming
coaches – with stop watches poised – insist on giving young
Leg PressKeri demonstrates the leg press.
Never neglect strengthening swimmer’s legs.

swimmers “short programs of lots of sprints because that long distance stuff is
no good for them?” One New Zealand Regional Chairman, not known for his
perspicacity, went as far as to use his 2001 Annual Report to moan about the
dangers of swimmers who “train long hours.” I tried and failed to get across the
idea that it’s not the hours, it’s what you do in the hours that matters. No
wonder the sport has such a high and young mortality rate as coaches thrash
young swimmers with training aimed at achieving a physiologically impossible
goal. At least with long conditioning training, young people have the
physiological development to accept and benefit from the training. Let me leave
the last word on this subject to the International Center for Aquatic Research,
“Endurance-based training may be the single most important component of
training throughout the entire career of the athlete.”
Some of the weight training exercises included in our schedules may cause
comment by gym personal trainers and supervisors. They will not understand
that the weight program has been developed specifically for swimming. Here
are the four comments our swimmers have had to deal with most frequently.
1.Don’t do the Pull Down Behind exercise. It will cause injury.
For the normal gym member this is good advice. The exercise does cause high
stress in the neck and upper back area. For a swimmer however strengthening
this area is most important. Lat. Pull Downs whether in front or behind are
important. Start off with light weights and increase them gradually as the
muscles get stronger and you should avoid injury. Put it this way: Toni Jeffs,
Nichola Chellingworth and Jane Copland combined have done this exercise
8980 times without injury. Obey the rules and you shouldn’t have a problem.
2.Don’t move your back in Elbow Raises
Swimmers doing this exercise should drop the weight down to
floor level after each lift by twisting their back and then lift the
weight by using both the back and arm muscles. For normal
gym members this is a real no-no. It puts too much stress on the
lower back and is an exercise normally just for the arms. For
swimmers, however, the back twisting movement is most
important for good freestyle and backstroke. The exercise is
valuable for strengthening this movement.
Elbow RaisesBranden demonstrates Elbow Raises. Branden is
13 years old and shows that a cautious weight program even at
this age increases strength and causes no harm.

3.Women shouldn’t do Chin Ups
It sounds like something out of the dark ages. You would be
surprised how often the comment has been made. I know a
coach who used to have his male swimmers do Chin Ups as
part of their warm-up but insisted the female swimmers did
something else. I asked why and he muttered something about
having children. It’s absolute rubbish of course. Nichola
Chellingworth could happily do 21 Chin Ups with ten kilograms
tied around her waist. Please don’t say, ”Ah, but she hasn’t had
children yet.” I couldn’t bear it.
Chin-ups Branden demonstrates chin ups.
A good exercise for testing swimmer’s arm strength
to body weight.
4. The weights you are lifting are too heavy
This comment is usually aimed at female swimmers. They shouldn’t have to put
up with it. It’s said because the majority of people do not realize the strength of
top female swimmers. Many of the exercises are done with weights well in
excess of their body weight. The reason for lifting heavy weights is based on the
principle that endurance will be developed by swimming and strength by
weights. Swimming is, after all, an exercise involving lots of repetitions of a light
weight. Since she was twelve years old I estimate Jane Copland has done nine
and three quarter million arm strokes, all repetitions of a light
weight. If you want to build endurance stay in the pool. It’s the
best place to do it and it is swimming specific. If you want to
build strength, go to a gym and lift heavy weights.
Breast weightsKeri demonstrates the breaststroke
arm press exercise using a machine designed for
exercising legs but ideal for the breaststroke press.

SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
In the process of introducing a young swimmer to Lydiard type conditioning, it is
important to understand the distinction between swimming one week of 100
kilometers and swimming consecutive weeks of this distance. Any crazy coach
can flog his squad through one week of 100 kilometers – and at training camps
and the like many do. We are not doing that. What we are about is building the
reserves of conditioning that enable young swimmers to train 100 kilometers
each week – week after week. And that is a very different thing. The benefit of
Lydiard conditioning is not in the 100 kilometers. It is in the fact that the 100
kilometers has to be repeated for ten weeks. It is important for coach and
swimmer to recognize that this is the conditioning goal.
Because getting through the distance is the young swimmers immediate priority,
it is important to put speed to one side. Push for both distance and speed at this
stage and you will probably ruin some young athlete’s promising career. As the
distance increases, the swimmer will get stronger and faster without the coach
demanding personal best sets. While I’m writing this, Branden – he’s the young
13 year old swimmer who began Lydiard type conditioning 20 weeks ago and is
now swimming 93 kilometers each week – has come into my office and said,
“It’s strange 20 weeks ago I had trouble making 1.30 minutes for the
Waitakeres 100s. Now I can hold 1.12 no problem.” I have just told him,”
That’s not strange at all. It’s called getting aerobically fitter.”

NOTES TO WEEK SIX SCHEDULES
The most significant change to this week’s program is the introduction on
Wednesday afternoon of “Hills”. This session gets its name from the weeks of
hill running Lydiard uses to effect the transition from 100 miles a week of
conditioning running to trials and coordination speed work on the track. In
deference to its Lydiard origins we decided to call the swimming session that
eases the same transition by the same name. It is important to have a transition
mechanism. Swimmers’ muscles have become used to miles of steady
swimming. But it will soon be time for the race specific end of the season to
begin. A Hills session is not however speed work. It does represent a lifting of
the tempo from all that has gone before, but it is certainly not a series of flat-out
sprints. The athlete swims 25m in a specified number of strokes, at about 70%
effort. For example Jane Copland and Nichola Chellingworth would normally
swim 25m in the build-up in 13/14 freestyle strokes. In the Hills 25m this
77

SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
increases to 16/18 strokes. In breaststroke the change is from 5 to 7 strokes. By
increasing the rhythm and tempo of these swims, the swimmers can ensure their
technique remains sound as they adjust to the speeds that will be expected in
the anaerobic and racing periods. As was reported in Swim to the Top, “During
one transition period, Nichola Chellingworth swam her first session of 25m Hills
in an average time of 13.58s (from a push-off) at a stroke rate of 0.71s. Five
weeks later, she swam her last session in an average of 12.47s at a stroke rate
of 0.54s. She was ready for the business end of the season to begin.”
With the exception of the introduction of Hills, the next five weeks copy the first
five weeks. In the case of the Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday long sessions the
repetition allows swimmers to evaluate progress by comparing the speed of the
same set in the first and second five weeks. It is important that the comparison is
genuine. There is no benefit in swimming a good aerobic effort in the first five
weeks and then winding up into an anaerobic gut-buster in the second five
weeks. Both efforts must be comparable and aerobic for the comparison to
have any meaning. If some of the long sets in the second five weeks are not
faster, there is no reason for concern. Material progress in aerobic conditioning
is more usually seen from season to season rather than within the same season.
I recall Genadi Touretski, the exceptional Russian swimming coach, being asked
what he thought was the most important quality in good coaching. He said,
“Patience.” He is right, especially when it comes to aerobic conditioning.
Physiological gains may take time, but when they do occur they are deep seated
and long lasting.
A drill included in the schedules is the breaststroke drill, Delayed Kick. The drill
is done by completing a full breaststroke arm stroke, then waiting three or four
seconds before doing the breaststroke kick. It is a new and most important drill.
The timing of modern breaststroke is quite different from the breaststroke swum
years ago. Today, the later the kick is made in the stroke, the better. The
principle is that a late kick allows time for the swimmer to get the arm stroke
almost completed and the arms and body streamlined prior to the kick taking
place. The kick is far more effective. Time spent on this drill and incorporating
its lessons into a swimmer’s normal stroke will be time well spent.
By week six of the build-up, the weights lifted will be getting near the maximum
possible while still holding 3 x 7 repetitions. Because the weights are really
heavy, I allow swimmers to reduce the repetitions to 3 x 6 when the weight of an
78

THEBUILD-UPSCHEDULES
exercise is first increased. The weight of different exercises will not increase
uniformly. Jane and Nichola loved Chin Ups and Elbow Raises. Toni Jeffs was
best at Dips and Machine Push Aparts – she was mind blowingly good at Dips.
All three were only average at the Bench Press for some reason.
I have seen a number of squads make two serious errors in the management of
their weight training program. Some squads replace one or more swimming
sessions with weights. This is wrong. Swimming training is still the best form of
training for swimming. Weights are an extra to be done over and above a full
program of swimming. They are not and must never be a replacement for
missed swimming sessions. Other squads do weights for limited periods – in the
winter months, during training camps or over school holidays. This is a waste of
time and money. Gains in strength from lifting weights occur quickly and so do
losses when weights are stopped. Once swimmers start using weights they must
be continued if the strength gains are to benefit competitive performances.
Weights should continue up to two or three days prior to the season’s main
event. The amount lifted should be reduced in the last two or three weeks before
the season’s main event, but if swimmers stop completely they may as well have
not started in the first place.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Young swimmers who aim to progress up to 100 kilometers can initially adjust
the schedules in this book by cutting back on the number of repetitions or
reducing the length of each repetition. In the first week after moving to a Lydiard
program, I aim to have young swimmers swim once a day for seven days. In
each session I set the same schedule but halve the distance done by swimmers
doing the full program – 3x2000m becomes 3x1000m and 1000m warm-up
becomes 500m and so on. This normally results in a weekly distance of around
33 kilometers. As the weeks go by I keep the number of sessions at seven, but
increase the distance of each session up to 75% of the full program – increasing
the weekly distance swum to 45 kilometers. At this point I introduce what the
Americans call, “doubles” – that’s swimming twice a day. Just one day of
doubles to start with then two until the new swimmer is at six days of doubles
and one single. By that stage the mileage will be around 80 kilometers and the
swimmer will be ready for the final push to 100 kilometers. This process
normally takes a good worker around two years to complete.

NOTES TO WEEK SEVEN SCHEDULES
Applying Lydiard’s training principles to the sport of swimming has received
more than its fair share of criticism. Bret Naylor, a former New Zealand national
coach, told me,” In swimming, it will never work.” In January 2000 he told Jane
Copland she would never be any good because Lydiard’s training was, “Wrong
for swimming.” The National Multi-Disability Coach was reported to have called
Lydiard’s methods ”Old hat.” A leading official in a large New Zealand club
asked coaches being interviewed for their Head Coach’s job, ”You don’t believe
in that Arthur Lydiard stuff, do you?” The only justification Lydiard needs is a
86

THEBUILD-UPSCHEDULES
bucket full of Olympic medals. However, it is worthwhile spending some time
looking at the theory of Lydiard’s ideas – just so the doubters know the whole
thing is not just a stab in the dark.
The first and most obvious feature is the large amount of time spent developing
each physiological characteristic separately; ten weeks on aerobic conditioning,
four weeks on anaerobic fitness and ten weeks on race preparation. Few other
programs make this stark distinction. They tend to include elements of the
different types of training in each month’s, or each week’s, or even each day’s
training. Lydiard however is right. The International Center For Aquatic Research
(ICAR) has found, “the energy systems (aerobic and anaerobic) adapt
independently” and at different rates to “each other to specific modes of training.
This is supported by the changes observed in the biochemical markers, PFK and
CS. Each of these enzymes changed only in response to specific training: PFK to
sprint training, CS to endurance training.” Cecil Colwin in his fine book,
“Swimming into the 21st Century” said, ”The development of improved aerobic
capacity is a long, slow process requiring a carefully devised long-term plan; by
the same token the resulting adaptations will be retained for a long time.” About
anaerobic training, however, he says, “When it is done properly, astonishing
improvements can be observed in just six weeks. Its effects are short lived and at
times appear volatile. The high performance level resulting from this training
rarely persist more than three months.” The evidence appears to support
Lydiard’s view that maintaining a clear separation between different types of
training is more compatible with the character of each training type and with the
way the body adapts than providing several and diverse training stimuli to
different energy systems at the same time. In other words, don’t mix your training.
In the 1950s and 1960s Lydiard may not have known all this scientific stuff, but
through practical experience he did know that looking after one thing at a time
produced the best result. And that’s still true in swimming today.
Lydiard puts this much more simply. He just says runner’s and swimmer’s hearts
and lungs, arteries and veins haven’t changed since the 1960s. If keeping
different training stimuli separate was the best method of training in the 1960s,
why shouldn’t it be the best today. Scientists make it sound more technical, but it
is the same thing.
The well-known emphasis Lydiard programs put on aerobic conditioning is also
widely disputed. This is fundamentally because Lydiard coaches see breaking
87

--- Page 89 Text ---
Swimming 02.02.2004 7:50 Uhr Seite 88
SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
records and winning championships primarily as endurance, aerobic
conditioning problems and not speed. Take the women’s 400m world record of
just over four minutes. To break it, each 50m must be swum in 30 seconds. In
New Zealand alone there are 50 or so women who can do that, each 100m in
one minute and there are around 30 who can do that, each 200m in two
minutes and there are two or three who can do that. No one, however, can get
within ten seconds of four minutes for 400m. Now that is not a speed problem.
There are heaps of women with enough basic speed. The problem is they do not
have the aerobic conditioning required to maintain their speed for four minutes.
Instead of beating New Zealand at 50m freestyle Toni Jeffs, with her basic
speed, could have beaten the world at 200m, if she had just been patient
enough to establish a well conditioned aerobic base. Susan O’Neil won the
women’s 200m freestyle at the Sydney Olympic Games. Properly conditioned
and swimming 200m, Toni Jeffs could very realistically have expected to beat
her. Even the great Ian Thorpe’s records are at speeds several New Zealand
men and many dozens around the world can swim. There again the problem is
aerobic conditioning. The Kenyan and Ethiopian runners beat the world not
because of speed, but because they can keep going at speed. The ability to
keep going can be trained. The first nation or major group that really takes to
this notion in swimming will steal the same march on the swimming world that
Lydiard did in athletics in Rome in 1960.
Lydiard coaching does not dismiss the vital importance of anaerobic fitness. Too
much time is allocated to training the anaerobic system in the next stages of the
swimmer’s preparation for that to be even remotely true. All this method of
coaching claims is that when a well trained anaerobic system is added to an
aerobic system that already allows swimmers to swim at very high speeds
without needing to call on anaerobic mechanisms, then the finest swims will
result. Aerobic conditioning achieves this by allowing the muscles to fire
powerfully and for longer periods using replenishable oxygen supplies before
the anaerobic system is required to take the athlete further or faster or both. This
is most likely the result of more and / or better quality access of oxygen to the
muscle firing process. Cecil Colwin in “Swimming into the 21st Century” goes
further and suggests that sound aerobic conditioning may also improve the
chemical interaction that takes place in order to fire each muscle contraction to
such an extent that less waste lactic acid is produced and peak performance can
be maintained for longer.

For young swimmers, Saturday mornings Waitakeres session is a special case. It
is a daunting mountain of a session but offers huge rewards for athletes
educated in how to swim the session well. When Jane Copland began her
swimming career, we shortened the 100x100m session by swimming 50m for
each 100m. As time went on and she got fitter she began to do more of the
repetitions as 100m until she could swim 1x50m then 1x100m through the set.
The 1x100m then became two, then three and so on until, in less than 12
months from beginning training, and at 13 years of age, she could swim
100x100m going every 1.30.
Samantha, 6 years old.
The distance swum at this
age is not likely to cause
a problem. It is speed
that can harm. The rigors
of a full Lydiard program
are for the future.

NOTES TO WEEK EIGHT SCHEDULES
Improved training methods will produce significant advances in swimming
speeds over the next few years. In twenty years we will look at the times of
Thorpe, de Bruin, Klim and O’Neil and say,” They weren’t all that fast” – just as
we do now with the times of Scholander, Rose, Fraser and even Spitz. However,
the sector that offers the greatest potential for progress is women’s swimming. In
just a few decades women have come from nowhere in swimming and sport in
general. They have progressed from not being able to compete at all to being
able to swim, but compelled to wear more than actresses do today attending the
Oscars. Even modern training books almost always have a special chapter on
women’s training. Women’s participation is not quite normal, a sort of, ”This
book was written with men in mind. If you want to apply it to women’s training it
should be modified as follows.” And the modifications are always less. What
percentage of men’s training can women handle? Only the most liberal
acknowledge women might be able to handle the same volume of training as
men. David Emery in his book, World Sporting Records wrote women off in less
than half a page. “There are,” he said, ”unalterable differences which count
against women.” They have smaller hearts, less blood, less hemoglobin, more
96

fat, poorer sporting shapes and can not deal with hot weather. “Overall,” the
book concludes, “females have an inferior capacity for physical performance
than males.” Little wonder I say. Any female reading that could be excused for
fleeing the playing field for life in a sanitarium. And it needn’t be this way.
Women do have advantages that may rapidly improve their sporting standards,
or in swimming, their world records.
Three advantages stand out. Studies have shown women convert fat to energy
quicker than men. This means they do not burn up their stores of carbohydrate
(glycogen) as quickly as men because their bodies are fueled by fat instead.
Secondly there seems to be inescapable evidence that women are more
contentious about work than men. In New Zealand, women, especially from all
female schools, outscore men in national examinations year after year and by a
huge percentage. One only has to coach a squad of males and females for a
few weeks to know which group has the best application. Thirdly, anecdotal
evidence suggests women put up with hardship better and for longer. Many
stories exist of woman living longer in conditions of hardship – shipwrecks,
being lost, and the like.
All this boils down to one hypothesis. Women genetically, physically and
mentally can work harder than men. The books and chapters on women’s
training address the wrong problem. It is not a question of what percentage of
an average male’s training should women do. It is a matter of deciding how
much more than males the average woman can or possibly should do, to be
working at a level that best maximizes her potential. I suspect the answer is a lot
more than even elite women are doing now and also a lot more than we would
all think. For example if 100km per week swimming is the right distance for an
average male’s build-up, what is it for women? My guess is that it is around
125km. In other words I believe women are capable of working 25% harder
than the average male. The flip side of that of course is that I also think women
have to work 25% harder to develop their potential to the same extent as men.
They can and they have to. When they do, you watch their records tumble.
It would be convenient to counter this view by saying, ”25% harder for the
same result. That’s not right or fair.” The answer is that the potential to work
harder is the female genetic advantage. Fair or not, play to that advantage.
An important adjustment required by the 100km per week build-up program is
time. Good swimmers can train build-up schedules at round four kilometers an
hour, or 25 hours each week for the 100km. Add to this 30 minutes per session
97

SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
to get to the pool, get changed and get wet, plus another 30 minutes to get out,
get dressed and get home and the hours increase to 38 per week. Each of the
five weight training sessions involves an hour each and the build-up training
commitment totals 43 hours per week. That timetable doesn’t provide time for
discussions with the coach, medical check-ups, physiotherapy, massage, sports
science or, and most importantly, rest. Swimmers training at this level require a
minimum of one and a half hours sleep each day in addition to the normal
eight or nine hours at night. Training is all about subjecting the body to stress
and allowing time for recovery. Miss out on the daily rest and recovery and the
benefits of training will not eventuate. The commitment is high. Fitting in school,
university or work is difficult. There is enough time, but only just. The activity
called social life will have to wait. Whether you want a life like this or not
depends entirely on whether you want to be one of the world’s best swimmers. If
you do, this is about what it takes. The data in the table below attempts to show
in tabular form the allocation of hours discussed in these notes. Not all the daily
hours multiplied by seven equal the weekly hours. This is because not all daily
things are done every day. Swimming training is 13 sessions for example, not
14 and weights are five not seven.

THEBUILD-UPSCHEDULES
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Many triathletes are wonderful swimmers. I have included them in the section on
"less experienced swimmers" only because they are not specialist pool swimmers
and cannot be expected to swim 100kms each week. If they did, there would
never be time to ride their bike or run. The table below shows the weekly
training distances recommended for an experienced triathlete through a full
training season.
TRIATHLON TRAINING DISTANCES
PERIOD WEEKLY DISTANCE – KMS
Build-up 18 Weeks 35
Transition 2 Weeks 30
Trials and Coordination 3 Weeks 20
Trials and Coordination 1 Week 14
Trials and Coordination 1 Week 10
TOTALS 25 Weeks 774
Reducing the pool swimmer’s schedules for triathlon training is best done by
cutting back in the manner recommended for less experienced swimmers –
reducing the number or length of the repetitions while still preserving the
physiological intent of the session. For top, experienced triathletes I recommend
a weekly program of four sessions. It is important the sessions selected from the
competitive swimmer’s weekly program preserve the balance of the training.
There would be no point in swimming four mixed recovery sessions or four kick
sessions. The training would not be balanced. The table below shows the
schedules I recommend experienced triathletes should select during the build-up
period.

NOTES TO WEEK NINE SCHEDULES
An important feature of Week Nine is Saturday’s second session of 100x100m.
Normally these are swum 1% to 2% faster than the same set in Week Ffive. The
conditions for an improvement are ideal. The build-up is almost complete. The
athlete will be finding the 100km distance more manageable and the influence of
Wednesday’s Hills session will have had some sharpening effect. There is no need
for concern if the session is not as fast. Not every day produces personal bests,
especially in aerobic conditioning where the long term is the important thing.
By Week Nine the swimmer should be lifting significantly more weight than in
Week One. The table below, reproduced from Swim to the Top, shows the
increase in the weight lifted by Nichola Chellingworth between Week One and
Week Ten of her 1996/97 build-up.

Nichola had just won the New Zealand Open Women’s 50m freestyle title when
she began this build-up, so she was not starting off as a weight training novice –
but she still improved in the ten weeks by the amounts shown.
In every build-up the number of strokes swum to each length is very important.
Every length, whatever the stroke, must be swum in a predetermined number of
strokes. As the build-up progresses, and certainly from build-up to build-up, the
swimmer must make every effort to bring the number of strokes per length down
while maintaining or even improving swimming speed. It is beyond belief the
number of swimmers and squads who ignore the importance of stroke
numbers. I know of a squad where the senior swimmers take 22-24 freestyle
strokes per 25m length for everything from the warm-up to one length sprints.
They clearly have never been taught the basics of their trade. Coaches that
clearly have no knowledge or interest in the number of strokes their swimmers
take to swim a length degrade their qualifications. They are tutors in politics
unaware of Aristotle, journalists who don’t know when to use an apostrophe.
A number of commentators have promoted the benefits of cross training. When
I first heard the term, I thought it meant training in a bad mood, “I’m not cross
training, I’m bloody furious.” I’ve heard of support for running, basketball,
touch rugby, surf lifesaving and even skiing – or was it hang-gliding. Toni Jeffs
spent some time trying to convince New Zealand that riding a bike was the best
way to swim a length of the pool. It’s all a load of nonsense of course. I do get

THEBUILD-UPSCHEDULES
swimmers to do 15 minutes of stationary cycling during their weight sessions,
but the best training for swimming is swimming. If you do all the swimming
involved in these schedules, and the weights, I would be surprised if you still
wanted to run or play touch rugby. If by some chance you do, go for another
swim. It’ll do you more good.
No mention has been made of dry land stretching in these schedules. This is
because I am opposed to the stretching routines undertaken by many squads
prior to training or racing. Physiologists and coaches instruct swimmers never
to stretch passed the point of hurting and then extol the benefit of achieving the
maximum stretch, of being the supplest. Hurt is a relative term, one man’s hurt
is another’s mild discomfort. I am convinced many of the injuries in swimming
and other sports begin as small muscle tears caused as athletes strive to
maximize their suppleness. Not one of my athletes has ever had a muscle
injury. An outcome that I believe is related directly to the absence of dry land
stretching. This is not to say I am against flexibility. How it is best achieved is
the question. I prefer and rely on the 500m of 20 stroke drills included in these
schedules. They are non-violent, very swimming specific, involve all the
swimming strokes and provide good flexibility. Certainly no physiological test
undertaken by my swimmers has ever found any lack of flexibility. In fact their
flexibility scores have been very good. Do the swimming drills in these
schedules well and they will provide swimmers with ample flexibility and at a
negligible risk of injury.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Master swimmers, surf swimmers and recreational fitness swimmers will probably
never have time to do the full build-up program. They can, however, still use
these schedules. They should select a balance of schedules that suit the amount
of time they have available. Whatever reduction is made, it should preserve the
mix of long schedules, mixed recovery schedules, kick schedules, hill schedules
and medley schedules, characteristic of the 100km program. Several sample
programs for swimmers who can swim between three and six times per week are
shown in the table on the next page. No distances are included in the
recommended programs. The distance swum will depend on factors such as the
swimmer’s level of fitness and the time available. Each swimmer should select
distances that suit their personal development and circumstances.

NOTES TO WEEK TEN SCHEDULES
The mileage for this week is 96km. The reduction of four kilometers is the result
of a change in Saturday morning’s training. The ten kilometers Waitakeres
schedule is dropped and replaced with the season’s first anaerobic session. This
schedule owes its origin to a track session used by Arch Jelley, coach of New
Zealand’s great miler, John Walker. At the same stage of training, Jelley gave
Walker an eight lapper, or 3200m time trial. The session stood out so clearly in
their minds that several years later when Walker was on the TV program, “This
Is Your Life” and was having to guess who the next guest was, Jelley introduced
himself with the words,” I think, today we’ll do an eight lapper.” Walker guessed
who it was! The length of the trial should vary depending on the swimmer’s
main event.

The recommended distances of the trial mean swimmers who specialize in
strokes other than freestyle will normally swim the 600m trial. Non-freestyle
specialists should swim the trial in their specialist stroke. The exception is
butterfly. Swimming this stroke badly, which over a long distance is easy to do, is
worse than not swimming it at all. Butterfly should only be used when the
distance can be swum competently and well using butterfly. If it can not, the trial
should be swum freestyle. Jane Copland has swum her trials as 600m
breaststroke. The times and annual improvement in her trials for her first six
training seasons are shown in the table below.

THEBUILD-UPSCHEDULES
The data for Jane Copland is shown, not because the times are the final word in
breaststroke swimming, but to demonstrate the amount of improvement that is
possible through the long term development of the aerobic energy system. It is
important to recall that these improvements in Jane Copland’s breaststroke
were achieved at a stage of the season before anaerobic or speed training had
even begun. Her 200m splits in the season six trial were 2.38.48, 2.43.74,
2.39.28. Given that many female breaststroke swimmers would love to swim
2.38 for 200m breaststroke on its own, let alone at the start of a 600m trial, the
data hardly supports the critics who claim a Lydiard swimming program wrecks
a swimmer’s speed.
The trial must not be swum as a flat out race. Keep in mind that this is still the
end of the build-up and swim the trial accordingly. It is a firm controlled effort to
be swum strongly, not raced. One way I do this is to reduce the number of
strokes swimmers can use. For example, Jane Copland swam the year six trial in
eight breaststroke strokes per length when her racing pace required nine
strokes. Limiting the stroke count controls the swimmer’s tendency to go too fast
too soon.
At the end of Week Ten the build-up is complete. The swimmer will be able to
look back on ten weeks and 996km of very sound aerobic conditioning. Jane
Copland once did an extra four kilometers on the last Sunday to claim the
1000km in ten weeks badge. In her last six build-ups she has averaged 96km
per week. Nichola Chellingworth’s best six build-ups averaged 74km and Toni
Jeffs best six averaged 80km. All three women were or are national open
champions and record holders. Remember, the effect of build-ups is cumulative.
Real performance gains accrue only when the swimmer has banked six or seven
build-ups. So don’t complete a build-up and expect a physical road-to-
Damascus experience. A swimmer’s performance will benefit a little from the
build-up just completed but it is in their cumulative effect that the real profit lies.
An athlete preparing for a major event, such as the World Championships or
Olympic Games, should resist the temptation to swim a huge build-up. I’ve seen
it done several times. In their enthusiasm to do well, coach and swimmer devote
themselves to swimming large mileages, well beyond anything they have done
before. At the Games, the swimmer performs badly and can’t understand why.
The reason of course is that the most amazing build-up ever will have left the
swimmer run-down and tired and will have had no positive effect on the
119

SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
competitive result. Toni Jeffs’ poor swim at the Barcelona Olympic Games was
because I made this error in her training. I added to it by then setting her speed
training that was also too far and too fast. All in all, she didn’t have much of a
chance. The lesson is that the build-up immediately prior to a major Games
should be no more than and preferably less than normal.
It is now time to move on to the next training stages, the transition week
followed by the four weeks of anaerobic conditioning.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
By Week Ten you will have a good idea of which newly promoted young
swimmers are going to survive a Lydiard type conditioning program. Which
swimmers justified their promotion and which ones should have been left in the
junior squads? Your ratio of success will be best if your selections were made for
the right reasons. Certain to fail criteria include: being the son of the Club
President, being the daughter of the Club’s most ambitious mother, being the
son of the Club’s nicest or best looking mother. A Lydiard program is no place
for imposters or the unprepared. You will be doing no one any favors by
promoting swimmers on the basis of privilege or position. Strangely, speed is
not always the best standard either. I have often left the fastest swimmer in a
junior squad as not yet ready for a Lydiard program. What you are looking for is
disciplined application – an ability to work. Promote young swimmers using that
measure and your success ratio will be good. When you find a fast one who can
also work, you have the best of both worlds – but hard work comes first.

CHAPTER TWO
THE TRANSITION SCHEDULES
On Wednesday afternoon through the last five weeks of the build-up, the session
of Hills began the process of preparing the athlete for the race specific training
about to begin. The transition week continues this process. As far as possible, it is
important not to spring training changes on a swimmer. Allowing a transition
period helps avoid injury and prepares the athlete mentally and physically for the
testing training ahead. The table below shows the distance of each training
session, the daily total distance and the position of each weight training program.

NOTES TO WEEK ELEVEN SCHEDULES
The mileage in the transition week drops to 85km. As the training speeds up,
the mileage must come down. Lydiard said, ”It’s impossible to run a four minute
mile and run around the Waitakeres at the same time.” At 85km, however, the
distance swum in our program is still well above that of many squads in the
peak of their distance training. For a swimmer who has just completed ten
weeks of 100km, however, the drop to 85km has a marked freshening effect – a
further clear signal of the deep reserves of fitness enjoyed by Lydiard
conditioned athletes.
The idea that as the athlete’s training speeds up, the distance swum should
reduce, sounds so logical that the casual reader probably thinks,”Yes, that
sounds right. What next?” However, in swimming the idea is not widely accepted
at all. In fact most squads try to increase the distance they swim and the speed
they swim it at, especially as they get close to a major competition. I know of
many local squads who go away to training camps three or four weeks before a
128

THETRANSITIONSCHEDULES
championship meet. Some apparently highly qualified coach then attempts to
get his charges to swim further than they do at any other time of the year and at
a faster speed. National New Zealand training camps used to be notorious for
the same reason. It is amazing how something so illogical should be so widely
practiced. Mind you, many people used to think the earth was flat.
Four of the transition week’s 13 sessions are sharpening swims. On Monday,
Wednesday and Saturday a session of fartlek swimming is programmed. Fartlek
is a Finnish word meaning speed play and describes a method of running
training where the pace is constantly varied. In the pool, fartlek usually involves
swimming one length, 25m, fast followed by one length easy through the
distance programmed. All transition week fartlek swims are 1500m. The fast
segment can be altered to 50m with a recovery of either 25m or 50m. Each of
the three sessions also includes 1000m of fartlek kick.
Fartlek has a remarkable sharpening effect – far better than the 15m or 25m
sprints used by many squads. Because it is continuous, fartlek replicates the
speed of racing without incurring the stress of actual competition. I time each of
the fast 25m. The table below shows the improvement in Jane Copland’s times
for the fartlek 25m over three recent summer seasons. This table is included, not
because the times are outstandingly fast, but because they show again the
nonsense of the view that build-up conditioning damages an athlete’s speed.
The butterfly and breaststroke times include the turn at the beginning of the fast
length. The backstroke and freestyle times include the turn at the end of each
fast length.

Lydiard does not approve of my timing the fartlek sessions. He is right; the spirit
of “speed-play” is pretty much broken when it is done under the watchful eye of
a stopwatch. Ideally I would recommend leaving the stopwatch out of these
sessions.
The fourth sharpening session is a session of Hills programmed for Thursday
afternoon. This is a continuation of the once-a-week Hills sessions included in
the last five weeks of the build-up.
Saturday afternoon’s stroke correction session continues into the transition
week.
The nature of this session, however, should change. During the build-up, stroke
correction training can address major stroke changes and make them at modest
swimming speeds. By the transition week, however, no more major changes
should be made. Coaches and swimmers should now perfect the strokes they
have developed and make sure the strokes stay sound at racing speeds. There is
a big difference between swimming well slowly and holding the same technique
at race pace. At many swim meets, I have noticed that the first thing to suffer
when swimmers go fast or get tired is their technique. The stroke correction
session should now address the question of technique at speed.
Apart from the four pace and one stroke correction training sessions, the
balance of the transition week’s training is aerobic conditioning swimming. This
serves to consolidate the aerobic gains made during the build-up and provides
time for recovery from the new stress of the fartlek swimming.
The introduction of transition training also changes the nature of the program’s
weight training. Until now every effort has gone into increasing the weights
lifted. This must now stop. For each exercise, whatever weight has been
achieved by the end of the build-up is the maximum for the season. From now
on the aim is to lift the same weight more comfortably, smoother and with better
technique. Some squads look on weight training as a means of developing
explosive power. I do not agree. Look at the swimming of Popov, de Bruin and
Van den Hodenband. All three represent the ultimate in the smooth application
of power. Not a grunting explosion in sight. Consolidating the weight lifted and
working to achieve easier and smoother lifts through the balance of the season’s
training is compatible with the objectives being worked on in the pool.

THETRANSITIONSCHEDULES
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Triathletes swimming 35km in the build-up weeks should swim 30km in the
transition week. There is not the same requirement to drop substantially the
transition mileage in triathlon training as there is in pool swimming, because the
need to go fast is not anything like as great. Remember triathlon swim racing
should be an aerobic threshold activity. The lack of anaerobic stress means the
weekly training distances can be maintained for longer. The triathlon athlete
should do two weeks of transition training by repeating the pool swimmer’s
one-week program. Two weeks are recommended because the triathlon
transition is from build-up to trials and coordination, whereas the pool swimmer
is making the less severe change from build-up to anaerobic conditioning.
The table below shows the schedules I recommend triathletes should select
during their two transition weeks.

CHAPTER THREE
THE ANAEROBIC SCHEDULES
At last the swimmer can begin specific training for the new season’s
competitions. By now he or she will be chomping at the bit. After ten weeks of
steady aerobic pace swimming, the swimmer will want to break out of the speed
jail. Over and over again I’ve heard swimmers say,” I can’t wait to go fast. I’m
going to really go for it now.” But they must not. In Swim to the Top, the chapter
on anaerobic training was called “Anaerobic Training – Festina Lenta”. The Latin
roughly translated means “make haste slowly”. As far as the four weeks
anaerobic swimming is concerned, no advice could be more important. When I
first discussed the principles of this stage of training with Arthur Lydiard, he used
expressions such as,” Hold back, keep the tiger in its cage and keep a lid on it.”
But more than any other he said,” It takes very little to sharpen a fit body.” And
that’s the key point. That’s why only four weeks are allocated to this first stage of
race preparation training. If you do go too hard it can bring your season to a
premature end. The swimmer becomes run-down, tired and even quite ill. It’s
called,”Going over the top.” As I said before, it’s what happened to Toni Jeffs in
Barcelona and it’s always serious. When it happens the only cure is to rest.
Danger signs of too much speed training stress include:
1. Frequent mild colds and sore throats
2. Swelling and aching of the lymph glands, in the neck, underarm and
groin
3. Skin eruptions among non-adolescents
4. Excessive nervousness, depression, irritability and headaches
5. Nagging fatigue accompanied by an inability to relax or sleep
6. Aching stomach often accompanied by a loss of appetite and weight
7. Diarrhea or constipation
8. Unexplained drops in performance levels
9. Disinterest in normally exciting activities
These signs require corrective action. This means lowering the training stress
level by having a week of gentle swimming or even a full week off while the
swimmer recovers. The problem is that many coaches prescribe hard work when

SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
things are going well and even harder work when they are going badly. I recall
one coach who trained a very good backstroke swimmer. At one regional
championship I noticed she just wasn’t swimming well. Her skin was in terrible
condition and I heard she had been affected by several bad colds. The problem
was overtraining, the cure was rest. At training the following week I was not
surprised to see the swimmer working through a set of 60x25m hard sprints.
Her coach clearly had no idea of the damage he was doing. All he understood
was she swam slowly, she must need more training. The swimmer lasted a few
more months and retired from swimming. If you observe symptoms of
overtraining and do nothing, or increase training, the problem will get
increasingly severe. Eventually the athlete will need a very long break to recover
or, as is often the case, will give the whole sport up as a waste of time.
Anaerobic means, without oxygen. In this instance it is a description of how the
energy compound ATP is supplied to the muscle. When the swimmer is
swimming sufficiently fast that the oxygen taken in is not enough to continue the
supply of ATP, the balanceof the energy requirement is derived from anaerobic
metabolism. Therein lies the key benefit of a Lydiard program. When the
efficiency of the aerobic system is lifted so that an increased amount of the
energy is supplied aerobically, the balance to be provided anaerobically is less.
This is good for the swimmer because anaerobic metabolism has serious
disadvantages as an energy source compared to aerobically sourced energy.
Firstly it is a less efficient method of producing ATP. The yield of two molecules
per molecule of glucose utilized is low. Secondly, the waste product of the break
down of glucose is lactic acid. Accumulating lactic acid and oxygen debt
become limiting factors to performance and are the source of the discomfort
associated with fatigue.
Whereas the previous ten weeks have aimed at reducing the yield of lactate,
anaerobic conditioning deliberately sets out to produce a high accumulation of
lactic acid, by having the swimmer work at a greatly increased level of intensity.
The objective is to improve the swimmer’s ability to buffer the accumulation of
lactic acid while at the same time limiting to some extent a decrease in pH.
Mileage in the four anaerobic weeks drops again to 80km. The table below
shows the distance of each training session, the daily total distance and the
position of each weight training program. Even at 80km, the distance swum is
still ample to maintain the swimmer’s aerobic conditioning.

NOTES TO WEEK TWELVE SCHEDULES
Anaerobic schedules are programmed on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. A
number of well-respected coaches feel anaerobic training should be limited to
two sessions per week. There is sense in this view. It is preferable to be short of
anaerobic conditioning than have done too much. Three anaerobic sessions
however can be swum with more security in a Lydiard program because:
1. Concentrated anaerobic training is restricted to just four weeks.
2. The sessions are swum in a very disciplined and restrained manner.
3. The Lydiard emphasis on establishing a large base of aerobic conditioning
equips the swimmer to handle anaerobic stress better than other methods of
training.
In the build-up, the long schedules swum in the first five weeks are repeated in the
second five weeks. The same principle is applied to the anaerobic training. The
anaerobic period’s Week One schedules are repeated in Week Three and the
Week Two schedules are repeated in Week Four (see Table on p. 143). This allows
the swimmer’s anaerobic adaptation to be measured through the four weeks.

SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
The distances swum are selected in order to provide a wide range of anaerobic
experiences. Distances are chosen that are shorter, longer and the same as the
distance of the swimmer’s main race. The very best anaerobic conditioning is
achieved when the swimmer has to adjust to moderate anaerobic stress over
longer distances and more intense stress over shorter distances. The aim is to
provide a comprehensive range of aerobic and anaerobic conditioning
experiences so that the athlete arrives at their competition equipped to handle
their race irrespective of the competition or the way the race is swum. Whatever
happens, they’ve experienced it all before. Whatever the distance of the
individual repetitions, the total distance of each anaerobic set is kept between
2400m and 3000m.
In addition to the three anaerobic days per week there are two further specialist
sessions. Hills are included on Thursday afternoon and stroke correction on
Saturday afternoon. Both sessions have the same purpose and are swum the
same way as in the transition week’s program.
The remaining eight sessions are general aerobic swimming to maintain the
swimmer’s aerobic conditioning and allow time for recovery from the anaerobic
swims. For example on Monday morning there is a straight 3000m swim, on
Tuesday afternoon 4 x 1000m and on Friday afternoon 7 x 400m individual
medleys. These must be swum as easy aerobic swims. The anaerobic training
will have lowered the swimmer’s blood pH and as anyone who has trained
strenuously knows acidity in the blood can result in sore muscles. Gentle aerobic
swimming over at least 48 hours is the best therapy for restoring a swimmer’s
blood levels to their normal pH. Certainly better than the day off each week
advocated by many swim squads. Recovery aerobic swims should also be used
to evaluate and check technique. As a swimmer speeds up and incurs the
fatigue of anaerobic conditioning, faults can appear that were not evident
during the slower build-up weeks.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
In the “pre-Lydiard” age group years, anaerobic training should be avoided.
Young swimmers are not physiologically ready for the stress of anaerobic
training. The physical characteristics required to benefit from this sort of training
normally do not mature until the mid-teen years. But beware – you will probably

be the only coach in the area that is not setting sets of eight or ten 100m and
whipping the junior squads into action. To make things worse, your juniors will
probably be beaten in the local McDonald’s mini-Olympics. Fear not, your
caution will be rewarded. When your group is eighteen, and is enjoying pushing
through another week of 100 kilometers in preparation for the next World Cup
meet, your neighbor will still be thrashing the next generation of ten year olds
and cursing his luck that none of them have “made it” like yours have. Contrary
to what most parents instinctively believe, it is not the distance swum or the early
mornings that “kills-off” young swimmers – it is speed. The traffic sign you see
on lots of roads around the world should be put at the end of every pool as well
– “SPEED KILLS.” Swimmers in their twenties, who have swum 20,000 kilometers
of aerobic conditioning, can handle the anaerobic schedules in this book. Prior
to this, and even if your swimmers lose races as a result, exercise great caution
through the anaerobic stage.
Samantha ready to go – at 6 years of age racing and training should be varied
and enjoyable.

NOTES TO WEEK THIRTEEN SCHEDULES
The way the anaerobic sets are swum is critical to their effectiveness. Most
squads and coaches are aware of the principle at work – that the more arduous
the exercise, the more lactic acid accumulates in the muscles and diffuses into
the blood stream. Performance declines once the amount of blood lactate
reaches a certain level. “If that’s the case,” says the logic of many coaches,” the
more arduous the training schedule, the more lactic acid accumulates, the
better.” I’ve seen some amazing schedules written in the belief that harder is
better. Toni Jeffs read an anaerobic schedule written on the white board at a
national training camp once and walked out. I thought she was right, the
schedule was horrendous, so was trying to explain where she had gone.

SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
Lydiard’s program does not view anaerobic training this way. The swimmer’s
metabolism has to be stressed in a sufficiently controlled manner that the very
highest levels of lactic acid are accumulated throughout the body. Crashing into
a flat out set of 100m will not do this. All that happens then is that large
amounts of lactic acid build up in the muscles which seize up before the lactic
acid has had time to diffuse in any significant way into the blood system. In our
program, each set is 2400m to 3000m long, irrespective of the length of each
repetition. This means the sets will take 25 to 30 minutes of actual swimming
time to complete. This is important, very important. The swimmer must swim as
strongly as he or she can, but must last the full 2400m and the full 30 minutes.
Go faster and lactic acid will seize up the muscles before diffusing fully into all
parts of the blood stream, go slower and lactic acid will not accumulate
sufficiently to provide the desired training benefit. In summary, anaerobic sets
must be swum at a speed that the swimmer can keep going for 30 minutes of
actual swimming time. Completely stuffed, but only at the end of 30 minutes, is
the instruction.
This is why Lydiard never worried whether anaerobic sets were run on a track or
the road or a golf course. Lydiard got New Zealand’s 1974 Commonwealth
Games 10,000m champion, Dick Taylor, to do most of his anaerobic training by
running the various length fairways at the local golf course as fast as he could
for 30 minutes.
The other thing Lydiard never worried about was timing these sets. One of the
real problems with swimming training is it always takes place between concrete
walls, an exact distance apart. The temptation to time everything is
overwhelming. With an exact distance, and an exact time, and an exact heart
rate, and a pH monitor, and a book of mathematical tables your average
swimming coach can predict the next coming of Christ. I’m forever falling into
the same trap. We all need to be more relaxed. As long as the swimmer is going
as hard as possible for 30 minutes for about the number of repetitions planned,
the physiological adaptations expected will occur.
It is important the coach teaches the swimmer that an anaerobic session is all
about achieving the required lactated state. If the swimmer starts off too fast and
tires too soon, then he or she should stop. Pushing on when the purpose of the
session has already been accomplished is possibly doing damage. Similarly, if
the swimmer reaches the end of the set in 30 minutes and is not fully fatigued,

THEANAEROBICSCHEDULES
the session should be extended until the swimmer feels the purpose of the
session has been accomplished. How you feel, is as good a measure as any
heart rate monitor, lactate test or (even) stop watch. In fact studies at the
International Center For Aquatic Research determined that ”training
performance can be accounted for by using perceived exertion. Perceived
exertion correlates well with established categories of work and can be an
effective and accurate method of having swimmers train more specifically for
their event requirements.” So there you have it – how you feel works.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
As we have already noted, young swimmers need to treat the anaerobic weeks
with even greater caution than experienced swimmers. They do not have the
reserves of aerobic conditioning that provide some protection to older athletes.
Nor do they have the knowledge of how to swim the programs. I tell my novice
swimmers that while the speed they swim the anaerobic swims should be faster
than their aerobic conditioning, they must not end the session in a state of
collapsed exhaustion. I stress the importance of not going too fast. This can
often end up with younger swimmers completing the four weeks of anaerobic
training still not fully anaerobically fit. Better that than overtraining the novice
swimmer.
In addition to maintaining a close watch on the effort used in this training, it is
proper to reduce the distance of the anaerobic sets for young swimmers – but
keep in mind the 30 minute rule. While experienced swimmers will swim six or
seven 400m in 30 minutes swimming time, less experienced swimmers might
manage only 6 x 300m in the same time. In that case that is what they should
do. Each of the six anaerobic sets can be adjusted in a similar manner. For
example I reduce the 16x150m by making the set (1x150m-1x75m)x8 and
changing the 12x200m into (1x200-1x100)x6. It is not difficult to adjust all the
anaerobic sets in a similar manner. When Jane Copland was starting out, I
used to get her to do the 100m program by swimming one 100m followed by
a 50m, followed by a 100m through to the full 30 minutes. As her swimming
improved some of the 50m became 100m until she was doing the whole set as
100m. The principle is that inexperienced swimmers should reduce the
distance swum to accommodate their ability level but must stick to the 30
minutes rule.

NOTES TO WEEK FOURTEEN SCHEDULES
Wishing swimming times could be ignored and actually ignoring them are two
entirely different things. I’ve always ended up timing the anaerobic sets. The
table opposite shows the anaerobic freestyle times swum by Jane Copland in
the six seasons, from the season she began training. All the times are short
course meters and are recorded from a wall push-off. The times are shown as
an illustration of the anaerobic improvement that takes place in these formative
years.

In addition to the swim sets, each anaerobic session includes a kick set. As
noted previously, a strong kick and fit legs are very important in achieving good
competitive results. The lactate tolerance of a swimmer’s legs needs to be
trained in just the same way as the more obvious muscles in the back, shoulders
and arms. It would be a serious mistake to swim anaerobic sets and miss out the
kick sets. Do this and the swimmer’s race results will be poor. Leg muscles will
lactate out part way through their race and the arms, back and shoulders will
soon follow as they struggle to compensate for the dead and hurting legs
dragging behind them. One of the main changes to the program since I began
coaching Toni Jeffs and Nichola Chellingworth is a greater emphasis on kick
training. It was actually one of Australia’s leading coaches, Peter Freaney from
Canberra, who said I wasn’t spending enough time on this aspect of a
swimmer’s training. He picked it up from just watching Toni and Nichola race,
which was a bit disturbing. I increased the leg training and they raced better.
Just four weeks after improving Nichola’s leg training, she set the New Zealand
13 years 50m freestyle record that still stands today.
It is important that swimmer’s anaerobic times are read and understood
correctly. Not every session will be an improvement on the previous session. Not
even every season will be an improvement. Most will but there are some where
163

--- Page 165 Text ---
Swimming 02.02.2004 7:50 Uhr Seite 164
SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
a full season goes by with no improvement. When this occurs there is no reason
for concern. Many factors can influence a swimmer’s rate of progress. The
swimmer had a cold this season, but was feeling really great last season. The
pool was crowded this season, but empty last season. Most important of all,
however, swimmers from time to time need to consolidate their progress. Two or
three seasons of good progress go by and for no obvious reason there is a
season where the swimmer seems to be drawing breath, gathering reserves and
getting ready to go again. I’ve no evidence for all this except that progress with
Toni Jeffs, Nichola Chellingworth and Jane Copland seemed to work that way.
Certainly progress was not a series of neat 3% annual improvements to national
swimming honors. When a pause in progress does occur, be patient. Take the
long-term view. Because the method of training you are using is sound, move
on and it will come right.
To illustrate the point further set out below is the percentage annual
improvement in Jane Copland’s competition times from the age of 12 to 18.
Competition times are different from anaerobic training times but the trend
makes the point. The table shows that after two early big improvements Jane
then went through four years of good improvement, plateau, good
improvement and plateau. This trend seems quite common in developing
swimmers.

THEANAEROBICSCHEDULES
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Both novice and international triathletes should stay aerobic during the triathlon
swim. A triathlete’s preparation should reflect this feature by reducing the
anaerobic, and trials and coordination content of the competitive pool
swimmer’s program. As you know, the full swimming program involves ten
weeks build-up, one week transition, four weeks anaerobic and ten weeks trials
and coordination training. A triathlete should change this six months, 25-week
mix to 18 weeks build-up, two weeks transition and five weeks trials and
coordination. The principal feature of this timetable is the exclusion of the
competitive pool swimmer’s anaerobic schedules in favor of twice the aerobic
build-up. This simply reflects the priorities and nature of the event. The two
weeks transition and five weeks of trials and coordination provide ample
anaerobic training for the swimming portion of a triathlon.
The first triathlete I assisted with his swimming training was Mr. Bob Loan, a
well-known New Zealand Master triathlete. He had qualified for the 1998 World
Age Group Triathlon Championships in Montreal. I coached him as I would a
1500m pool swimmer. At Montreal he swam the 1500m really well but ran out
of puff, as they say, in the latter part of the bike and in the run. There is no
question that the anaerobic and speed work we had done had prepared Bob to
swim a great 1500m, and that’s what he did. Don’t make the same mistake.
Prepare for the triathlon swim recognizing what it is – the first third of a much
longer race.
The Triathlon swim
requires the athlete’s
best aerobic effort.
Anaerobic effort is
best reserved for the
running and cycling
stages.

NOTES TO WEEK FIFTEEN SCHEDULES
We have already discussed the primary purpose of the anaerobic training – to
maximize the accumulation of lactic acid in order to educate the body to
tolerate its effects. This is different from the swimmer’s ability to access
anaerobic mechanisms at a high rate. Right now we are addressing the quantity
question – how much? The next trials and coordination section of the program
will address the question of access quality – how fast? It is important to
understand this distinction. It forms the basis for the number and variety of
intervals included in these schedules. It also forms the basis for determining the
rest interval between each repetition.
In most squads, the coach determines the length of rest the squad should have
and then specifies a time for each repetition in the set. The amount of rest is
often expressed as a ratio of the length of the repetition. In the build-up, the
173

--- Page 175 Text ---
Swimming 02.02.2004 7:50 Uhr Seite 174
SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
ratio of rest is very low, normally less than the time taken to swim the repetition.
In the anaerobic quantity period the ratio of rest increases, and in the trials and
coordination period of training, where the quality of anaerobic access is most
important,the rest ratio increases again – sometimes as high as 1:8.
The problem with strictly controlled pace clock training is that the pace clock
can’t take into account how the swimmer feels. The fact that four minutes or
whatever has gone by since the last repetition, may or may not mean anything
in terms of the athlete’s recovery. For this reason I decided to abandon the
pool’s pace clock. Instead I decided I would teach the swimmers what the
training had to accomplish. In this case, a state of comprehensive anaerobic
fatigue after 30 minutes of fast swimming. I would then leave them to determine
their own rest as they swam the anaerobic set. They knew they had to rest just
long enough to swim the next repetition fast enough that when all the swims
were finished, they would be thoroughly fatigued. And it worked. I now almost
never use the pool’s pace clock. It’s a prop to support coaches that are too lazy
to teach their swimmers the physiology of what their swimmers are expected to
achieve. Teach your swimmers well and let them get on with it as responsible
adults, not slaves to a bent metal pointer spinning on the pool wall.
Whether coaches take this attitude to training or
prefer the pace clock, stopwatch, everyone into
the pool by 6.00am SHARP, army style control,
depends, I think on their view of athletes. When I
first met Lydiard, his first counsel was, ”Always
trust your athlete.” He says the same thing today.
Whether a coach accepts the advice depends, I
suppose, on whether coaches see themselves as
helping mature athletes achieve their goals or as
instructors of children. I prefer Lydiard’s way. I’m
sure it makes the whole thing more rewarding
for the athlete and the coach. So many good
things in the sport and in life follow from
respecting your athletes in the Lydiard way.
If you do decide to continue setting a pace clock interval, don’t set ever more
difficult times until the swimmer fails to meet one of the start times. Don’t plan
deliberate failure. I visited a pool in a local town recently and was told by the
174

THEANAEROBICSCHEDULES
coach that he’d had a good day; he’d been able to set a schedule that morning
that had been so tough two swimmers had vomited part way through. Anyone
can do that, only someone really stupid looks on it as a victory.
Finishing Week Fifteen means swimmers have completed the aerobic build-up
and the anaerobic conditioning sections of the program. They will be feeling
aerobically and anaerobically fit. All they want to do is get out and start racing.
And still they must be held back, just for a few more weeks. Their biggest
training change is about to take place. Until now the training has been general.
It has addressed the athlete’s aerobic and anaerobic conditioning with not a lot
of attention to the specifics of the athlete’s event or competition timetable. From
now on, through the trials and coordination stage, every detail of the program
will focus on the specifics of racing well.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
If educating older, experienced swimmers to train themselves without being
slaves to a pool pace clock is important, it is vital to the career development of
young swimmers. You want to avoid what I came across recently in a masters
group I was coaching. It was made up of very good ex-college swimmers and
one ex-Olympian. It was certainly not a group for the fainthearted. On my first
night with them, I put a program up and explained its physiological purpose in
exactly the way I would for my experienced swimmers. They had all the
information required to determine how the schedule should be swum. When I
finished my explanation the group still looked puzzled. I asked, “Is everything all
right?” One of them said, “What time do you want us to go on?” How sad, I
thought, all my explanation of the program and how it should be swum to
achieve a physiological objective was wasted. For years and at the highest levels
of the sport, these guys had been coached to be robots. Well, it is my guess that
the world’s best swimmers in the future will not be robots. They will be swimmers
who know how to swim their training, because they know its physiological
purpose. A coach of young and less experienced swimmers should ensure
nurturing this knowledge is as much part of their coaching as the finer points of
racing starts and turns.

THETRIALSANDCOORDINATIONSCHEDULES
CHAPTER FOUR
THE TRIALS AND COORDINATION SCHEDULES
Firmly setting schedules for the ten weeks of the trials and coordination period is
more difficult than the build-up or anaerobic training periods. In these weeks the
coach’s task is to fine-tune the athlete to peak racing condition. The motto of the
period is “fresh and sharp.” The hard aerobic and anaerobic conditioning work of
the season has been done. It is now time to put the cutting edge on all that
conditioning. This can not be accomplished if the swimmer is swimming long
distances or flogging through hard sets of anaerobic repetitions at the same time.
The foundation on which the training is based is a series of time trials in the
period’s first five weeks and then a series of races in the period’s second five
weeks, culminating in the main races of the season in the tenth week. The time
trials and races are consciously designed mock exams. They are tests during
which the swimmer’s endurance, anaerobic conditioning, speed, technique,
starts, turns, stroke counts, stroke rates and all the other skills required to race
well are tested and retested. Shortcomings are corrected in the week’s other
sessions before the swimmer is tested again. This test, correction, test, correction
process continues through the 10 weeks, culminating in the season’s main
competition. As Lydiard said, “You should be in a good position to pass the
main exam after ten weeks of mock tests.” Just as important, the season’s main
event is a natural follow on from all that has gone before. It is something that is
built up to in a logical and controlled manner. It doesn’t take a coaching genius
to see that this must have advantages over the traditional train-like-mad and
stop-for-a-two weeks taper and hope method used by many squads.
Because of the test and correction nature of this period of training, the specific
content of each training session will vary depending on the outcome of each test
and the nature of the correction required. The schedules should therefore be
used even more as a guide than the schedules in the previous periods. To use
them best, look hard at what each schedule is attempting to achieve and then
look at your own circumstance and determine whether this or some other test or
correction is what you need.
The table on the next page sets out a summary of the 10 weeks trials and
coordination period, showing the mileage and type of each session.

NOTES TO WEEK SIXTEEN SCHEDULES
The most obvious change in the first week of trials and coordination is the drop
in mileage to just 40kms. The freshening effect of a 50% cut in swimming
mileage is dramatic. To many swimmers 40kms represents a good week’s
training. To a Lydiard swimmer it’s a public holiday. Every fiber will want to go
fast, to exploit new found reserves of strength and conditioning. But, for just two
or three more weeks, hold back. The time to go fast is not far away. Until then
just wait, wait and be patient.
The morning swims of two kilometers are wake up swims. Their purpose is to
loosen the swimmer up after a night’s sleep. The work of the day will be done in
the afternoon session.
The fartlek session on Monday and Thursday is a swimming copy of a key
sharpening session used by Arthur Lydiard and Arch Jelley. On the track it is
called “50-50s”, because it is done by running hard for 50m and gliding for
50m for the full distance. Alison Wright ran sessions of between 1600m and
184

--- OCR from Page 185 Image 1 ---
WIMMIh

Swimming 02.02.2004 7:50 Uhr Seite 185
THETRIALSANDCOORDINATIONSCHEDULES
3200m of 50-50s at this time of the season. Prior to setting the New Zealand
1000m record of 2.38.60 in Berlin, Alison was running 1600m of 50-50s in
under five minutes. So her overall pace was not exactly slow. Swimmers should
find their speed for the 25m fast portion of the fartlek swims improves as they
begin to benefit from the freshening influence of the lower mileage. As I’ve said
before there is no need to time the fartlek. Most of us though can’t resist the
temptation.
The purpose of Wednesday’s Hills session changes during the trials and
coordination period. The session still has an important sharpening function but
it is now a session where the swimmer also drills starts and turns. The session’s
main set is just two dives and three turns of each stroke. Set out below is a
checklist of random thoughts on starts and turns. Its purpose is to encourage
coaches and swimmers to think about what they are doing and question
whether improvements can be made.
1.Track starts are better than feet together starts
The New Zealand TV1 swimming expert, Antony Moss, tells everyone the
opposite, but he’s wrong – again. His best bit of commentary was when he
announced, positively frothing with excitement, that Petria Thomas was now,
”pulling her hands out of the bottom of her togs.” Anyway back to track starts. If
you look at the start reaction times at World Cups, World Championships and
Olympic Games the track starters out-start feet together starters all the time. No
evidence exists to support claims that feet together starters make up for their
slow start with a better push-off. In starting, I’m afraid, slow is slow.
2.Don’t lean or rock back before you dive
Years ago we all used to swing our arms in huge circles, in order to improve the
distance of the dive. Then someone figured out that the improved distance of
the dive never made up for the hours it took to finish the circles. Hence, no more
arm swings! Leaning and rocking back is a modern version of the same fault. In
starting, stay forward, go forward.
3.No jackknives or mid-air kicks
These aeronautical displays are becoming a thing of the past. In sport in
general, it’s amazing how often if a thing looks strange, it’s probably wrong.
Keep it simple is the best advice. Concentrate on simple actions done perfectly.
They will produce better results than complicated dramatics.
185

Swimming 02.02.2004 7:50 Uhr Seite 186
SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
4.Stay deep
In the old days we all tried to make our dives as shallow as possible. Everything
was aimed at getting to the surface and getting going as quickly as possible.
Today we know more about the resistance of water, especially the resistance of
water on the surface. In breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly go deep in the
dive and use that depth to get maximum advantage under the water. Because of
its higher swimming speed the length of time under the water in freestyle will be
less but should still not be rushed. Use the dive, don’t rush the dive.
5.Tuck tight – real tight
In freestyle and backstroke tumble turns it is remarkable how many swimmers
open out their turns too much. The tighter the tuck the better. The logic is simple.
It takes longer to travel around a four meter arc than it does to travel a two
meters arc.
6. Don’t stop your feet
Many swimmers doing tumble or swivel turns place their feet on the wall and
then push as two separate actions – action one, feet on the wall, action two,
push off the wall. This is slow. From the time the legs first begin to straighten
until the swimmer is streamlining away from the wall is one continuous process.
The fact that within that process the swimmer’s feet come into contact with the
wall is irrelevant. The legs were pushing back before the feet came into contact
with the wall and should continue just the same after contact. The whole thing
must be one movement.
7.Don’t stop your hands
In breaststroke and butterfly many swimmers complete each length by firmly
placing their hands on the wall before removing them as quickly as possible to
complete the turn and begin the next length. Once again there are two
processes involved. Hands on the wall for a momentary stop, then start again
with the turn and swim. This is slow. Nowhere in the Rules does it say the
swimmer’s hands must stop, or even be stationary. It just says they must “touch”
the wall. Therefore swimmers should touch the wall with their hands in motion,
sliding across the wall into the turn. The touch should only be a brush across the

the three turns in the race was 0.75sec per turn, 3.75sec over the race, faster
than the average turn time of the other seven swimmers. A lot of that difference
was what they did with their hands on each wall. Keep moving.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
As the senior pool swimmers move into the trials and coordination weeks and as
the distance they swim each week comes down, the schedules of the senior and
junior members of the team will become increasingly similar. There is no reason
why junior swimmers can not do the fartlek, short sprints, time trials and early
morning swims characteristic of the senior program. The concessions I make to
their inexperience include shortening the distance of the fartlek and warm-up
and warm-down swims. Apart from that, in the trials and coordination period,
experienced and inexperienced swimmers can train together. Junior swimmers
will have had some experience of starts, turns, finishes, stroke technique and
racing stroke plans in their “pre-Lydiard” days. They will not, however, have
experienced anything like the accuracy expected at this stage – and that will take
some learning.
Lolly Erickson – at 26 she began a
Lydiard conditioning program as a
Masters swimmer but now swims all
sessions with the open squad, testament
to the benefit of good aerobic
conditioning.

NOTES TO WEEK SEVENTEEN SCHEDULES
The time trial and racing program incorporated into the trials and coordination
period should be an integrated and purposeful entity in its own right. Each time
trial and race through the ten weeks should constructively contribute towards the
swimmer’s main race in the last week of the season. The race program is as
much a part of the swimmer’s preparation for the season’s main races as the
training schedules that have lead up to this point. The strokes to be swum, the
distance of each race and the number of races require just as much planning as
earlier training schedules. It is amazing how often this does not happen. How
often have you seen a note on the local swimming club’s notice board saying,
”Would swimmers please record their entries for next weeks carnival?” The
coach might as well say, ”And while you’re at it write down the training you want
to do next week as well.”
We will consider now the season’s time trials and races and look at the purpose
and the role they play in the competitive program. The example used here is for
a swimmer whose main event is 200m breaststroke. Swimmers with other main
events should study the logic of the selections made in this program and choose
time trials and races that make the same contribution to their event.

For example a 150m breaststroke time trial in the sample program is a 75%
time trial. The same trial for a 50m specialist would be 37.5 meters, for a 100m
swimmer, 75m and for a 400m swimmer, 300m. A 6x50m trial in the sample
program would be 6x12.5m for a 50m swimmer, 6x25m for a 100m swimmer
and 6x100m for a 400m swimmer.

SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
Week 16, Saturday, 200m Individual Medley– A start up trial in an event the
swimmer is good at, but is not his or her main event. If swimmers are going to
make mistakes or be slower than expected it will be in these early trials. By
swimming non-main events in early trials the stress to perform will be less.
Week 17, Saturday, 250m Breaststroke – Much of the swimmer’s early
preparation has been aimed at aerobic and anaerobic conditioning. A trial
longer than the swimmer’s main event will test the extent to which this has been
successful.
Week 18, Wednesday, 2x100m Breaststroke – One of the 100m should be
swum from a dive and the other from a turn, including the turn at the start of the
swim. This is the first of the pace judgement swims, designed to replicate the
number of strokes, distance per stroke and stroke rate of the swimmer’s 200m
race plan.
Week 18,Saturday, 150m and 50m Breaststroke– An important trial in which
the swimmer attempts to swim to the 75% distance at the 200m race plan. The
50m is then done from a turn, replicating the last 50m of the 200m race plan.
The rest between these swims should be about 30 seconds.
Week 19,Wednesday, 200m (As 4x50m) Breaststroke– A trial to sharpen the
swimmer’s race speed.
Week 19,Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 50m Freestyle, 200m Individual Medley,
100m Freestyle – The first race meet, like the first time trial, should stay away
from the swimmer’s specialist event. It gives the swimmer the opportunity to get
back into racing mode without the stress of it being in their main event.
Week 20, Wednesday, 200m (As 8x25m) Breaststroke – A further trial to
sharpen the swimmer’s racing speed.
Week 20, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 50m, 100m and 200m Breaststroke –
The second race meeting should be the swimmer’s first races over their
specialist distance.
Week 22, Wednesday, 2x100m Breaststroke – This trial repeats the same trial
done in week eighteen. It is done again now to improve on week eighteen’s trial
and correct any errors that appeared in week twenty’s specialist event race meet.
Week 22, Saturday, 150m and 50m Breaststroke – A further Week Eighteen,
repeat trial and for the same reasons.

Week 23, Wednesday, 200m (As 4x50m) Breaststroke – A further trial to
sharpen the swimmer’s race speed.
Week 23, Saturday, Sunday, 100m and 200m Breaststroke – The third race
meeting should be the swimmer’s second competition over their specialist
distance.
Week 24, Wednesday, 200m (As 8x25m) Breaststroke – A further trial to
sharpen the swimmer’s racing speed.
Week 24, Saturday, Sunday, 200m Individual Medley, 100m Freestyle – If
things have gone well in the third meet, the fourth race meet can be a further
race sharpening meet in events away from the swimmer’s main events. If further
specialist event competition is required it can be done in this twenty-fourth week
meet.
Week 25, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, 50m 100m and
200m Breaststroke and 200m Individual Medley – The season’s main
competition.
The total program involves 14 time trials and 30 races for a season’s total of 44
race type efforts.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Early in their career young swimmers can and should swim races involving
different strokes and different distances. A number of times in this book I have
mentioned the importance of variety in the development of young people. Race
programs are no different. Once a young swimmer begins a Lydiard type
training program these things change. The uninhibited approach of the young
must be replaced by a carefully thought out purposeful racing program. The
investment by the young swimmer in the time and effort required to swim the
schedules in this book is just too great to leave the purpose of it all – racing – to
chance. As soon as the training changes to a Lydiard conditioning program, the
criteria for selecting a swimmer’s racing program must also change. Many
coaches, swimmers and parents make the mistake of mixing serious training
with a laissez-faire approach to racing. This will not work. The change in
preparation represented by the schedules in this book is an integrated package
not a series of independent units to be accepted or rejected.

THETRIALSANDCOORDINATIONSCHEDULES
Many swimmers compete week after week without having a race plan. Not a
proper one anyway. A coach sitting on a deck chair telling his charges that he
wants them to, “Really push along in the third lap,” does not constitute a race
plan. Nor does the ritual I’ve seen in one local club, where the swimmers lie on
the clubroom floor and dream about how well they will swim their next race. They
even call it dream time. When Jane Copland heard about this she, tongue-in-
cheek, said, “That’s different from me. I dream about how well I have already
swum.” A race plan is not a dream. It is a predetermined specification that
provides the swimmer with all the information required to perform. As an
example, set out on the next page is the race plan Jane Copland used for her
200m breaststroke New Zealand short-course record. This plan was prepared
several weeks before the race. All sections of it were practiced and drilled in the
trials and coordination weeks well before race day. The fartlek swims, the Hills
and the time trials were all swum according to this race plan. By the time the race
day arrived, executing the plan was something Jane was confident she could do.
She had done all its parts, many times. She had even swum a time trial of 75% of
the distance exactly according to the plan’s specification. Putting it together on
race day was still a challenge but it was far from an unknown challenge.
In that truth lies the key advantage of a race plan. It is a specification of items
the swimmer can control. Too often swimmers are told, “You can swim 2.30 for
200m breaststroke. Go out and show them how.” Apart from conveying the
coach’s confidence in their ability, there is no information here to help the
swimmer. The end result of 2.30 is no use. The final time happens only at the
end of the swim. By that time it’s obviously far too late for the swimmer to do
anything about fixing faults in their performance. For many years, sports
psychologists have summarized this by stressing the need to focus on the
process, not the outcome. The race plan provides the swimmer with the process
in great detail and says, ”focus on that”.
All this is why I am not a great believer in inspiring pre-race pep talks. On the
day of a race a coach should talk about the race only if asked a specific
question. Apart from that there is no need to talk about the race at all. The
weeks of working the race plan have provided the swimmer with all the
information needed. A coach raving on at this late stage usually only causes
confusion and worry. Information overload, just when it’s needed least. Silence
on the other hand provides swimmers with confidence that they have this thing
under control. And they always do anyway.

THETRIALSANDCOORDINATIONSCHEDULES
The race plan shows the plan prepared in October 2001 for Jane Copland’s
attempt on the New Zealand Open Woman’s 200m Breaststroke Record. The
second show the result of her swim when she set the new record in Waipukurau
on December 3rd 2001. As you can see she swam the first three lengths faster
than planned and paid for this later in the race when she was unable to hold
her planned speed. As she tired on the last length her turnover increased, her
stroke length shortened and the planned number of strokes increased from nine
to ten. She made it under the old record but the time would have been faster
had she been closer to the plan in the first three lengths.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Especially difficult for the junior swimmer in the trials and coordination period is
the introduction of disciplined stroke race plans. Until now young swimmers
have been used to “having a go”. Dive in, go flat out, arms and legs everywhere
and see what happens – and that is right and proper. But young swimmers will
not explore their full potential that way. Now is the time for them to perfect the
skills of the swimming trade, and foremost among these is the skill to race
according to a predetermined stroke plan. It will take time and practice –
probably lots of time and practice.
In the early seasons, coaches should not set impossible stroke rate plans. A top
female breaststroke swimmer races through 200m breaststroke in eight or nine
strokes per 25m length. Expecting a young swimmer to match this will lead to
disappointment and poor results. If a young swimmer can only hold twelve or
thirteen strokes then that should be the plan.

SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
NOTES TO WEEK NINETEEN SCHEDULES
Finally in Week Nineteen, it’s time to go racing.
I try and make the first competition a regional championship meet. In New
Zealand we are fortunate that in mid-summer and mid-winter the various
Regions have summer and winter provincial championships. It is possible to
program two or three of these in this early competition period.
My background in track and field meant that when I went to my first swim meet I
wondered what on earth I’d come across. It was an hour before the meet was
due to start and the pool was full of swimmers, all stroking up and down at a
hundred miles an hour. The water looked like the North Atlantic in a force ten.
“What are they doing?” I asked my companion. “They’re warming up.” he said.
I didn’t understand it then and I don’t understand it now. It is beyond belief the
way coaches order their squads into action an hour before the meet begins and
for some swimmers perhaps three hours before they race. You don’t need a
Level Five coaching qualification to know that a warm-up done one or two or
three hours before a race is senseless. The reason for doing a warm-up is to
prepare the swimmer to race. Most important in that process is lifting the
swimmer’s heart rate to make ready the circulation, respiration and muscular
systems.
The way most swimmers do their warm-up, their heart rate, respiration and
muscles will have well and truly returned to normal by race time. The only thing
the warm-up has done is make the swimmer tired and settle the coach’s nerves.
Most warm-ups would be better described as last minute training sessions. A
warm-up must be timed so that the swimmer moves relatively quickly from warm-
up pool to the race start. Then the benefit of the warm-up is still with the swimmer.
I recommend swimmers start their warm-up 35-45 minutes prior to their race. The
warm-up swim takes 20-30 minutes, change into their racing suit takes 5-10
minutes and check in and marshaling takes the balance of 5-10 minutes.
Just as bewildering as the warm-up ritual is the parade of coaches on the side of
the pool taking the warm-up, their importance accurately conveyed by the
number and expense of the stopwatches hung around their necks. Two, “one
hundred memory grays” and you are a knight of the coaching realm. One, “five
memory black” and you’re just plain old Mr. Coach, with a very long way to go.

Apart from their symbolism, I am unsure why swim coaches have all those
watches at warm-up time. I have never timed a swimmer doing anything during
a warm-up. Warm-up is not the time to be working out whether a swimmer is
fast enough, or knows what pace to swim. If all that hasn’t been sorted out long
ago, the coach and the swimmer haven’t been doing their job. Plying the
swimmer with stopwatch information at this stage is another example of
information overload. It’s too much, too late and the swimmer doesn’t need it. It
is interesting that in years of watching some of the world’s greatest runners
warm up, I’ve never seen a coach time anything. Walker, Dixon, Quax, Ovett,
Coe and Viren, I’ve been fortunate enough to see them all warm up and have
never seen a stopwatch. Yet in swimming you can’t get down the pool without
dodging dozens of thrust-out arms grasping a stopwatch. My recommendation
is, leave stopwatches out of the warm-up.
In swimming warm-ups, too much swimming is done too fast. This is especially
true with 50m and 100m sprinters. These swimmers are best held back for as
long as possible. Keep the warm-up slow, apart from one or two dives with only
a couple of fast strokes. Keep away from those 15m or 25m or even worse 50m
sprints. In sprinting there is one time to go fast and that’s when someone in a
white coat says,” Take your marks, go.” When I was coaching Toni Jeffs, we
watched her competitors at many New Zealand Championships sprint up and
down the pool in the warm-up and we knew Toni’s chances of winning were
improving all the time. New Zealand’s National Coach, Clive Rushton
suggested recently that some of my swimmers could do with slowing down their
warm-up. I think he is right. It just goes to show how easy it is to get caught up
in winning-the-warm-up even when you know better.
Middle and long distance swimmers appear to need a longer warm-up,
including a few 15m untimed swim-throughs. The important point is that a
coach’s job is not to set a swimmer’s warm-up. A coach has to teach swimmers
what the warm-up is expected to achieve. The precise length and content of a
warm-up is then best left to the swimmer to decide. Many swimmers, for
example, prefer longer warm-ups at the beginning of the racing season and are
happy with shorter warm-ups as the season progresses.
Coaches should avoid setting squad warm-ups as though they were a training
schedule. I’m sure many of the marathon warm-ups I’ve seen are set by
coaches wanting to impress their peers with their toughness. “I’m a tougher
209

coach than you. Look at how far I get my swimmers to swim in their warm-up.” I
can’t think of any other reason for the aerobic conditioning done in these pre-
race swims. Peer pressure in coaching can be a wonderful stimulus to stupidity.
National training camps used to be classic examples of this. Swimmers would
stagger home after two weeks of putting up with a coach’s determined efforts to
prove he was the toughest coach in New Zealand. Those in charge had the idea
that the longer a swimmer took to recover from a national training camp, the
better the camp. I used to tell my swimmers, ”If they are going too fast, swim at
the back, but don’t come home and take two months to recover.” I think a few
coaches have wondered how someone can race so fast who trains at the back
of their camp squad all the time.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Special care is needed with young swimmers in their first few Lydiard seasons.
Their early races will probably be disappointing as their bodies make the final
adjustment to the stress of racing. They could well loose to their anaerobic
overloaded mates from the Club down the road. Even swimmers they used to
beat could beat them in these early races. To a young swimmer who has just
completed 1000km of hard distance conditioning this can be very depressing.
Many times – more often than I care to remember – I recall swimmers saying,
“I’ve swum further than anyone else and they all beat me.” It is a coach’s job to
prepare young swimmers for this, to make them aware that this is part of the
process. It will come right. They have laid the foundation of good things to come
and must be patient while this last stage is completed.

THETRIALSANDCOORDINATIONSCHEDULES
NOTES TO WEEK TWENTY SCHEDULES
Week Twenty is almost a copy of Week Nineteen. The early part of the week is
spent improving the swimmer’s freshness and sharpness. The time trial on
Wednesday is a broken 200m at each 25m. There should be about 30 seconds
rest between each 25m. The first length is done from a dive. The other seven
lengths are done from a turn. This means the swimmer swims into the wall at
the start of each length and is timed from the moment the hands touch the wall
to begin the turn.
At the end of the week, a second weekend’s competition should be programmed
during which the swimmer will tackle their main events – in our example the
50m, 100m and 200m breaststroke. The swimmer’s race plans will now be
tested in competition conditions. It is most important not to worry if things don’t
go according to plan. They seldom do. In fact a perfect race in a very fast time at
this stage is not the best result. You could be coming right too quickly. The main
competition is still several weeks away. It is then that the perfect race in the fastest
time is required. The most likely result at this early stage is that mistakes will
occur. The swimmer will go out too fast and tie up badly in the final stages of the
race. The race plan will be too ambitious or not ambitious enough. The swimmer
will be short of speed. The dives and turns will be slow. There are more than
enough things to go wrong. But keep in mind, getting things wrong is why you’re
swimming these early events. They are trial swims to identify errors and correct
them before the main event, still some weeks away. At the time it might be
difficult to keep the long-term in mind. All of us tend to panic a bit. Just
remember that mistakes at this stage are not a bad thing.
If you do have a perfect trial in a very fast time it could be you are coming right too
soon. In this case it is wise to ease back on some of the speed training. Instead of
the sprints on Monday do a steady swim. Instead of the broken 200m time trial do
some drills and steady kicks. It can be quite difficult to do this. Human nature
being what it is tends to lead us to the thought that when we are swimming really
fast, if we push along even harder, we’ll go faster still. This is seldom the case. All
that happens is that swimmers push on harder and harder until they collapse and
end up run-down and tired. When this does happen it is usually too late to fix
before the season’s main event. In 2002 one of Jane Copland’s main breaststroke
competitors swam a fast time six weeks before the New Zealand National
215

SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
Championships. I said to Jane, ”She has just swum her National’s race.” I knew
her coach would interpret the fast swim as a good sign and in the next six weeks
would push for even more speed. At the Nationals, Jane’s competitor swam a time
five seconds slower than the time she had swum six weeks earlier. Jane beat her by
six seconds. Good trials still need careful analysis.
The most common error in the early races is a tendency to tie up at the end of a
race. The skeptics will be quick to say, ”See, all that long distance training
doesn’t work.” When they do, all they show is that they do not understand the
difference between aerobic and anaerobic. When a swimmer ties up at the end
of a race, it is normally a shortage of anaerobic conditioning that is the
problem. This will be corrected quickly in the coming weeks as the trials, races
and training further improve the swimmer’s anaerobic fitness. Don’t be tempted
to crash into piles of anaerobic conditioning sets in training. That’s what I did
with Toni Jeffs prior to the Barcelona Olympic Games and look what a mess that
was. Remember it takes very little to sharpen a fit body.
The same view needs to be taken of a shortage of speed, especially in the
shorter 50m and 100m events. I recall the summer season after Nichola
Chellingworth won the New Zealand Winter 50m freestyle Championship. Her
first 50m race of the summer was the Auckland Championships. She won that
too, but swam a slow time, much slower than she had finished the previous
winter. Anne, her mother, was naturally upset and concerned that her daughter
had swum 1200kms only to get slower. Later, at the right time, Nichola won the
New Zealand summer 50m butterfly title. Early in the season, remember
another expression of Arthur Lydiard’s, ”Anyone can coach a swimmer to win
some day. A good coach can coach a swimmer to win on a specific day.”
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Trials and coordination schedules are just as relevant to Master swimmers, surf
swimmers and even recreational fitness swimmers. Most people enjoy seeing
whether they have shaved a few seconds off their best time. The fastest Masters
swimmer I have coached was a freestyle and backstroke sprinter from New
Zealand called Iain Trousdell. He was in the 50-55 year age group and was the
New Zealand Master’s Champion and record holder at 50m freestyle. He had a
best time of 26 high for 50m freestyle.

Iain swam pretty much the same trials and coordination schedules as the open
swimmers. He did not do the morning swims but swam the afternoon training
shown in this book. He was good enough that he could take on some of the
“young guns” in the open squad and on a good day give them a run for their
money.
The concessions to age I think are wise are for Master swimmers to visit a GP to
check everything is in order before beginning time trials and the like, and watch
the amount of anaerobic swimming. The combination of age plus memories of
how good they used to be can lead Masters to overdo things. Start out slowly
and work up gradually and I am forever amazed at the sets some of these
“oldies” can manage.

SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
NOTES TO WEEK TWENTY-ONE SCHEDULES
Week Twenty-One is a swimming development of the Lydiard program. The
week is virtually a week-off, with only two short swims during the week and a
further three over the weekend. The benefits of a quiet week at this stage
appeared as an unintentional byproduct of a change to Jane Copland’s
program two or three seasons ago. Jane had just won her first New Zealand
Open Winter title and we had programmed a quiet week’s holiday before she
began next season’s build-up. During the week we were made aware of a
representative meet in Jane’s local region and a World Cup Meet in Melbourne,
Australia just four and five weeks away. Instead of beginning a new build-up we
decided to extend Jane’s racing period and enter her in these two meets. At the
regional meet she set a new New Zealand Open 200m breaststroke record and
at the World Cup she swam into the top eight final. Both swims were four
seconds faster than she had swum at the New Zealand Championships. It was
almost as if the week-off had super freshening effect. The next season I
deliberately programmed a week-off four weeks out from the season’s main
event. The effect was the same and Jane won her first national long course title.
The explanation, I conclude, is that after 147 days of continuous training a
complete and sudden break at this stage has a super compensating and
freshening effect. I also remembered how often athletes and swimmers produce
very fast times several weeks after a forced week-off with an injury, or a week of
very light training while traveling to a distant meet. Deliberately programming
such a break is completely compatible with Lydiard’s doctrine of fresh and
sharp. It is just taking it to a logical conclusion.
Obviously the week-off will only work when the rest of the swimmer’s training
has been a Lydiard type program. Many squads don’t train hard enough in the
first place for the break to have any effect. There is nothing to super compensate
from. Other squads that save their hardest training for the weeks immediately
before their main event, would be taking time off just when they normally train
hardest. But in a Lydiard program it works very well indeed.
Weight training sessions in the trials and coordination period should also be
based on Lydiard’s principle of fresh and sharp. Their purpose should change
from increasing the swimmer’s strength to maintaining the strength gains made

in the first 15 weeks. Strength gains from weight training are quickly lost when
weights are stopped. It is important therefore to keep training in the gymnasium
right up to race time. The amount of weight lifted through the trials and
coordination period should reduce significantly from the maximum lifted in the
build-up and anaerobic periods of training. After some time, experienced
swimmers intuitively know how much to reduce the weight lifted in each
exercise. Swimmers can feel when they are not straining to make each lift but
are still lifting enough to maintain their strength.
To give some idea of the amount of reduction, the table below shows the
maximum weight lifted by Nichola Chellingworth during the build-up and
anaerobic periods and the weight she lifted in the trials and coordination
period. The table is reproduced from “Swim to the Top.”
TRIALS AND COORDINATION– WEIGHTS

Dips 11 3
Chin Ups 10 3
Flys 17 10
Squats 200 150
Elbow Raises 46 30
Tricep Push Downs 32 20
An item of gymnasium training not discussed until now is the 15 minutes of
stationary cycling that should be part of each gymnasium session. A medium
level of resistance should be applied. For example, on a bike with six grades of
resistance, I ask swimmers to cycle at level three. This level should reasonably
closely represent the effort required to cycle along a flat to very modest sloping
section of road. The swimmer should hold a heart rate effort of between 130-
150bpm.

However the purpose of the five times per week cycle is not to condition the
general cardio-vascular system, although any benefit in this area is more than
welcome. I recommend the bike as a form of weight training for conditioning
and strengthening the swimmer’s legs. I have found the bike especially good for
breaststroke swimmers who rely on legs for 50% to 70% of their swimming
speed. In fact the reason I introduced 15 minutes on the bike into the weight
program was when I went for a bike ride and noticed the discomfort in my legs
was very similar to the discomfort experienced at the end of a breaststroke
swim. That combined with Duncan Lang, New Zealand’s best swim coach,
telling me he strongly supported stationary bike work, especially for breaststroke
swimmers convinced me to give it a go. It worked.

NOTES TO WEEK TWENTY-TWO SCHEDULES
The week after the mid-term break is spent getting back into swimming. Training
consists of steady swimming, some short sprints and time trials on Wednesday
and Saturday.
Psychologically the week off serves as a period of reflection. Swimmer and
coach can evaluate the results of the first two competitive outings and determine
whether any fine tuning changes are required in the final weeks push to the
season’s main competition. By not racing in this first week back, there is time to
action any necessary changes.
It could be that the swimmer still needs sharpening, in which case some extra
sessions of short sprints (Hills) can be added to the program. Perhaps there are
signs that the swimmer’s anaerobic fitness needs further development, in which
case some additional fartlek or an overdistance time trial can be included. Resist
the temptation to get stuck into hard sets of 15x100m or 10x200m. They will
have an effect on your race results – a bad one. Your main competitive event is
not 15x100m. That sort of training is not specific enough and is too severe to be
swum at this stage of the season. I know a local doctor who has a talented
young daughter who is constantly being battered with anaerobic training at this
stage of the season. After a brilliant first couple of seasons she is now constantly
sick with glandular fever, influenza, colds and other run-down complaints. The
parents appear to put it down to bad luck. They certainly never link the training
to her problems. You would think someone with a medical degree would be
better at diagnosis. It is amazing how many people leave their brains at the
training pool door.
In Week 22 I have assumed the results of the first competitions have been in
line with early season expectations and have programmed a 2x100m time trial
on Wednesday and a 150m and 50m time trial on Saturday. Both are pace
227

--- Page 229 Text ---
Swimming 02.02.2004 7:50 Uhr Seite 228
SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
judgement trials. The 2x100m should be done, one from a dive and one from a
turn. The 150m/50m trial tests the ability of the swimmer to get to 75% distance
on schedule for the race plan time. Stress on the swimmer the importance of
swimming to the race plan. Don’t allow swimmers to sprint flat out and then
convince themselves that they are better than they actually are. Use the trial as
intended, as a test of whether swimmers can swim to the race plan. If swum
accordingly and the trial comes out faster, that’s good. Just don’t force it.
The sample programs do not take into account the disruption caused by
overseas competition. Whether it is a short flight to Australia or a major journey
to compete on the European World Cup circuit, travel time and fatigue need to
be taken into account when setting the swimmer’s trials and coordination
program. Swimmers I have trained have competed in 60 Asian, Australian or
European World Cup Meets. For European meets, I program the off-week as the
week’s travel which allows time to get there and spend two or three days easy
swimming before getting into the competitive routine. Of course, the
recommended schedules have to be amended during a European tour. The
normal routine of time trial on Wednesday, race on Saturday and Sunday is
replaced with racing on Tuesday and Wednesday and racing again on Saturday
and Sunday.
When you know your European race schedule, superimpose it on the
recommended trials and coordination template of training and adjust the
individual sessions accordingly. There is never any need for hard training
between the racing days. Between meets, training should be steady swims with
occasionally a few short sharp sprints – no anaerobic training. The races will
achieve any anaerobic training purpose required to reach peak performances
during the tour.
In “Swim to the Top” I discussed the importance of making sure European tours
were long enough to exploit the swimmers base training. For a Lydiard
conditioned athlete, a racing tour is a wonderful opportunity to swim fast times.
Racing four times each week exploits the resources of conditioning accumulated
as part of this program. With every race the Lydiard conditioned swimmer will
get better and better. Tours of 8-12 meets over 4-6 weeks can be planned,
confident that the swimmer will improve all the way through. While others are
running out of steam towards the end of the tour, the well-conditioned swimmer
will still be recording personal best times.

THETRIALSANDCOORDINATIONSCHEDULES
As the swimmer approaches the season’s main competition, one aspect stands out.
Swimming at this level requires a huge commitment of time and determination. In
New Zealand, successful swimmers are allocated to a series of national squads
according to their speed and in some cases their age. The main reward for being in
one of the squads is the swimmer becomes eligible for national team selection. A
few also get an athlete’s card that entitles them to a bit of free medical attention,
some elementary sports science and some sports psychology.
The problem is, all this is incredibly well meaning, but so very amateur. As
far as the participants are concerned it really is just the same sport it was 50
years ago. An infrastructure of paid administrators has been put in place and
are doing well for themselves. But for the swimmer in the street not a lot has
changed. This problem must be addressed. The sport must be professionalized.
It is a worldwide problem that each country must address in its own way.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Swimming trials are an important part of triathlon training. They are the means
by which athletes can practice swimming at their fastest speed, short of going
anaerobic. The ideal triathlon swim is one that is as fast as possible without
calling on the athlete’s anaerobic reserves. Preserve this energy source until it is
needed later in the race – during the cycle or the run. If your swimming build-up
conditioning has been done well, you will be amply fast enough to keep up with
your interval-trained competition without going anaerobic this early in the race.
For an Olympic distance triathlon, I would program the following trials in the
first three weeks of the five weeks trials and coordination period:
TRIATHLON SWIMMING TIME TRIALS
Trials and Coordination – First Week
Wednesday 2000 Over distance trial
Saturday 750 Under distance trial

NOTES TO WEEK TWENTY-THREE SCHEDULES
Considerable thought and attention needs to be paid to planning a swimmer’s
race schedule. Every race should be there for a reason. There is only one
acceptable reason – the race chosen contributes most to the swimmer
performing best in the season’s main competition. No other reason, absolutely
none, should be given any weight whatsoever.
Yet, that’s not the way it is in many clubs. They have several reasons for a
swimmer being entered in a race. Some of the more common are:
1.To score points for the Club
This is a common motive. Swimmers enter as many races as possible to score
points so their Club can beat the Club down the road for points towards some
trophy. It is given legitimacy as promoting and teaching team participation. The
group before the individual. The selfish interests of the individual subjugated to
the benefit of the collective. Swimming Marxism.
233

Swimming 02.02.2004 7:50 Uhr Seite 234
SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
Because the “club-first” doctrine is promoted as a moral good, challenging the
concept is fraught with danger. It carries the social cost of declining military
conscription. You are unpatriotic and disloyal. Your club needs you and you’re
wearing a white feather.
The philosophy is however fundamentally flawed. As I have said before, short of
walking alone to the North Pole, swimming is the ultimate individual sport. To be
successful requires being alone. Ignore that and you court failure. And there
have been many failures. Search the records of your local clubs. Scores of
casualties caused by the interests of the individual taking second place to the
interests of their club.
National Federations encourage the vandalism by rewarding the club that
scores the most points at all their competitions. The Americans make the same
mistake in their NCAA competition. Swim everything for the good of the
University. At least they have the good manners to pay swimmers for making the
sacrifice. The Americans, with a population of 250 million, can afford the
casualty rate and still find more conscripts to charge the guns. New Zealand
with its population of four million does not.
2.To score points for the coach
Entering dozens of races to make the coach look good is the worst possible
motive. I heard one well-known coach defend the concept by saying, “It makes
them tough.” No it doesn’t. The training in this book makes them tough. Anyway,
when was the point of competing to be tough. The point of swimming a race is
to contribute towards your swimming career. It certainly is not to bring some
swimming coach five points closer to proving in his own mind that he’s the best
coach in the district. Swimmers sacrificed all over the place, but he was the best.
It’s strange that in a profession that profits most from a minimum of ego, swim
coaching should have so much of it. One of Jane Copland friends calls New
Zealand’s big ego coaches, “The Cool Coaches.” This lot engenders huge
loyalty among their subjects. “My coach always thinks of what’s best for me. He
said it was good for me to swim eight races today. Of course, I’ll swim them.” Be
very clear, if your coach suggests this sort of competitive program, he is not
thinking of you. All he wants is the mobile phone prize that goes to the coach
scoring the most points.

If I had followed this philosophy with Jane Copland, Nichola Chellingworth and
Toni Jeffs, I could have won dozens of mobile phones and perhaps even a “500
memory grey”. Toni was a national freestyle and butterfly champion, so was
Nichola. Toni was also better than average at backstroke. Jane is a national age
group medley record holder and the national open breaststroke champion and
record holder. She is also the New South Wales age group backstroke
champion. In many levels of competition, all three could have entered most
races and would have won. However, they never were entered and the longevity
of all three (34, 23 and 19 years) is evidence to the wisdom of that decision.
3.To score points for themselves
This is just as shortsighted as the other
two point’s objectives. Whether they are
for the team, the coach or the swimmer,
point’s trophies are a blight on the land.
They physiologically hurt swimmers and
send out the message that 30 average
swims are better than one good one.
How to parent Duvante’s grandad
demonstrates how to be the perfect
parent at swimming practice.
4.Because the swimmer wants to
This excuse is used often by coaches, administrators and parents to justify
absurd race programs. It really is a senseless thing to say, especially when it is
said by a young swimmer’s parents. Parents intervene when their children might
come to harm drinking, smoking or experimenting with drugs. Yet when their
child is faced with the danger of a mammoth race program, “Because the
swimmer wants to”, it is considered a perfectly good enough excuse. Coaches,
parents and administrators have a responsibility to provide guidance to
swimmers. They should not abdicate that duty when it comes to deciding on a
swimmer’s race schedule. Then again, perhaps the real problem is that coach,
parent and administrator don’t want the schedule changed. They’re hooked on
the adrenaline rush of watching their subject race.
235

Swimming 02.02.2004 7:50 Uhr Seite 236
SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
I do not know what the record is for the maximum number of races swum in a
three-day regional championship. I have frequently seen local swimmers
entered in every event (15) on the program. With heats and finals that’s 30
races, plus two relays, total 32 in just three days. That’s about one race every 45
minutes of competition time for three days. You don’t need to be an Olympic
swimming coach to know that doesn’t sound right. We sit around having
conferences about why young swimmers don’t last in the sport. After four or five
years of this sort of abuse, no wonder they want to call it quits.
5. To contribute towards the swimmer’s long-term swimming
development
Normally I enter a swimmer in just one event, two races, each day. In some
circumstances, such as a double-up in the program, I have accepted two events,
four races, in a day but never more than that. It makes sense really.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
During the trials and coordination period, triathletes should practice the skills
specific to their sport. An important difference between pool swimming and
triathlons is the open water location of triathlon competitions. This does involve
different skills from the training that is the main focus of this book. I recommend
triathletes always swim the time trials in open water. Trials should copy, as
closely as possible, competition conditions. Attention should be paid to starting
in a group, swimming in a group, rounding buoys, navigation and the transition
from swim to cycle. It is particularly important to become comfortable swimming
in rough water and in a wet suit. The different breathing pattern and shorter
stroke required in rough conditions can quickly tire a triathlete. The word
coordination is included in the name of this period because, whatever the sport,
its skills need perfecting in the weeks leading up to the season’s main
competitions. The diverse skills required in a triathlon make this an especially
important time.

NOTES TO WEEK TWENTY-FOUR SCHEDULES
The last week of training before the season’s main competition is really a time to
hold to the principles of fresh and sharp. At this stage any immoderate training
will only do harm. If you are not ready to race by now, doing a crash program of
training in the last week is not going to fix it. It is better to arrive at next week’s
competition a little short of some training item than arrive in any way overdone.
At about this time you will notice the freshening effect of the trials and
coordination weeks. It is remarkable how accurate the Lydiard program is at
bringing athletes to a peak at the right time. Some would say, and I have, that it

is far too late for the good of the coach’s nerves, but sometime during this week
swimmers will just get better. Everything they swim will be faster and for no more
effort. They will end up saying to themselves, ”How did that happen?” It
happened because a very good running coach in Auckland, New Zealand put
together a program that is based on proper physiological principles and, in a
judicious and logical way, brings athletes to their peak performance on a
particular day.
A word of caution though. Do not try and force this peaking process. At this time
of the season you will see dozens of swimmers in the pool fighting to go faster.
Nichola Chellingworth used to call it “panic swimming”. Do not join them. Be
confident enough in your training and in the peaking process to stay relaxed
and let your preparation take its natural course. It has always worked in the past
and it will work for you too.
There are a few magnificent swimmers and runners who look as though
every stroke and step is an aggressive painful fight. There is nothing relaxed and
smooth about the way Claudia Poll swims. Brendan Foster looked as though
every step would be his last. The majority of the world’s best, however, appear as
though they are not really trying. Popov, Thorpe, Scholander, Ovett and Snell are
all athletes of this type. Alison Wright was a fine example of this quality. I’ve seen
her run in some of the world’s major meets, and she looked like it was a stroll in
the park. In Berlin, in 1978, when she set the current New Zealand 1000 meters
record, I didn’t think she was running nearly fast enough. It looked far too easy.
When it looks slow but is actually really fast, then you are in peak condition. I
encourage swimmers to relax and swim this way by using expressions such as, “I
don’t care whether you are the fastest in next week’s meet as long as you look the
best.” or alternatively, “Don’t show me how fast you can swim, show me how well
you can swim.” I think most people who have know the best athletes I have
helped, even those critical of their results, would say that Alison Wright, Peter
Baker, Toni Jeffs, Nichola Chellingworth and Jane Copland at their best looked
bloody great. And so they should, that’s the result a Lydiard conditioning
program is supposed to produce – smooth, easy, relaxed power.
I was never lucky enough to see Peter Snell run. If I had, I think he would have
been my favorite. I did see Steve Ovett run on several occasions. At his best he
was magnificent. There was the same arrogant contempt in his long relaxed stride
and low slung arms that Mohammed Ali had when he danced for an opponent.
You have to be good – very, very good to do that. In swimming there is Popov.

I first saw him swim in the New South Wales Championships when they were still
held at the Blacktown Pool, before the days of the flash International Sydney
Aquatic Center. At first I didn’t know who he was. A magnificent aquatic animal
was playing with the human beings beside him. How do you describe perfection?
You knew straight away you were watching the model for the rest of us to copy.
Since then, others have swum faster, but none ever better, not yet anyway.
And then there is Jenny Thompson. I first saw her swim in the south of
France prior to the Barcelona Olympic Games. She was only doing a couple of
swim-throughs with her coach Richard Quick, but I knew immediately there was
no point in Toni Jeffs continuing to sprint 50m freestyle. All the training in the
world and Toni could never beat that – and she never has. Thompson was too
big, too fast, too strong, too good. She was a real sprinter. To this day, whenever
I watch a swimmer I’m helping swim freestyle, I superimpose the mental picture
I have of Jenny Thompson swimming those swim-throughs to see how close to
her we’re getting. Jenny’s still a long way ahead – one day though.
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Do not swim the triathlon trials as the speed trials swum by pool swimmers. For
the triathlete they are better described as pace trials – swims that the athlete
uses to rehearse the controlled pace of the competition swim. There is no reason
why trial swims can not be part of trials that include cycling and running. Club
triathlon events can be great pace trials. Don’t kill yourself trying to win them
though. Remember the trials are preparation for a much bigger goal. Treat
them accordingly. Even when the trial is just a swim it should always include a
full transition to the bike.
There is an argument that triathletes can exclude kicks from their swimming
training. Cycling and running are mainly “leg” sports and provide plenty of leg
exercise. Besides, 1500m and 3000m swims do not call for a lot of kick. There
is some validity in this view. The percentage of kick can be reduced by about a
quarter. It would be a foolish triathlete who reduced the amount of kick by more
than this or worse excluded the kick altogether. Conditioning leg muscles to the
specific demands of the freestyle kick is important and can not be done by
running and cycling alone. Even in triathlon swims, some kick is needed and if
the legs give way, the swim will be long and slow and, more seriously, the cycle
and run will be affected.

NOTES TO WEEK TWENTY-FIVE SCHEDULES
Week 25’s competition is the culmination of a season’s training. If the training
has been done well, the swimmer’s results will be as expected. It is important to
have a process in place so that the results can be evaluated rationally and
without emotion. Far too many swimmers are considered good or bad by what’s
going on around them. “Suzy from down the road swam faster than I did. I must
be no good” is not a good basis for evaluation. When Jane Copland was
starting off she competed against a precocious breaststroke talent from
Wellington called Gemma Davis. Gemma was very good at a young age. She
set numerous New Zealand age group records. Jane swam second to her on
many occasions. To evaluate either swimmer’s long-term career by their results
at this stage would have been a mistake. Eventually, as the effect of Jane’s
Lydiard conditioning took effect, Jane passed Gemma who eventually drifted
out of swimming and went on to do other things. The same story could be told
innumerable times with different actors. How others are doing is not a good
basis for evaluating your progress – even when you are the one going fastest.
I maintain two sets of information for use in evaluating a swimmer’s progress.
1.Race Record
In this file I record the final time for each race swum, the split times for each lap,
the swimmer’s placing and whether the swim was a personal best time (PB).
This information is important when it comes to setting future race plans. Analysis
of the results can determine whether trends are present that should be
addressed. Is the swimmer going out too fast and tying up at the end of the

race? Is the swimmer starting too slowly? Does the swimmer start the season
well, but perform poorly later in the season? Which strokes and distances are
the swimmers strongest and are they changing? Resolving these matters is
facilitated by the information held in the race record.
Summarizing the data also gives an interesting general view of the swimmer’s
career. The table below shows a summary of this data from Jane Copland’s
Race Record.
JANE COPLAND – RACE RECORD
Swum Event Number Number
PBs %
Races 430 162 37.67
Time trials 204 93 45.59
Total 634 255 40.22
2.Personal Bests Record
This is an important record of a swimmer’s annual improvement. Because the
data is kept on an annual basis, it includes the results of two six-month Lydiard
training cycles. Key figures in the record are the per annum improvement and
cumulative improvement. In Jane Copland’s case, at 18 years of age she has a
career cumulative improvement in the breaststroke events of 2.66% per annum.
Earlier, an improvement figure of 2.96% was given for Jane’s cumulative
improvement. This was for all the events she has swum not just breaststroke.
Experience with swimmers around the world has shown that this figure should
stay above 2.5% per annum cumulatively. If it does not, progress will become
just too slow to reach top international standards.
The cumulative improvement percentage figure is, of course, a consolidation of
the improvement over three events, the 50m,100m and 200m, in two different
length pools, 25m and 50m. Coaches and swimmers should look behind the
consolidated figure to determine progress in the different distances and different
247

SWIMMING– A TRAININGPROGRAM
strokes. It is perfectly possible for a swimmer’s specialty to change. The record
of personal bests helps avoid permanently branding a swimmer as only good at
one thing when they may be developing potential elsewhere. Before the
Olympic Games in Sydney, who would have picked the Italian freestyler
Masamiliano as a winner of the 200m individual medley or the Australian
butterfly swimmer Susan O’Neil as the winner of the 200m freestyle.
At the end of Week 25 the swimmer will have completed a full six-month cycle.
He or she will be a much different athlete from the one that started 25 weeks
ago. Most significantly the knowledge of how the body and mind respond to
physical stress and improve as a result of proper conditioning will have
increased beyond measure. But before starting off on the next six-month cycle of
Lydiard conditioning it’s time for a weeks holiday – enjoy!
YOUNGER AND LESS EXPERIENCED SWIMMERS
Several years ago I taught a young Wellington girl to swim. Her name is Kate
Hevelt. She didn’t like the water and for three terms of 36 lessons I tried to get
her swimming. I tried everything. I was nice, horrible, kind and nasty. Nothing
seemed to work. I had always been able to get young people to swim before,
but I feared Kate would be my first failure. Then it happened, right at the end of
Term Three she tripped in the pool, went under, came up crying but something
had changed. She had felt and had recognized the water’s support. We
continued the lesson for another 20 minutes by which time she could lie on the
water and kick a few meters. As Kate and her mother, Mary-Pat, left I said to
Kate, ”One day you might swim in the Olympics.” At Kate’s next lesson Mary-Pat
said, ”I wish you hadn’t said that about the Olympics.” “Why not?” I asked.
“Because,” Mary-Pat said, “Kate lay awake most of the night because Mr. Wright
said she had to swim in the Olympic Games.”
In spite of her inauspicious start, Kate’s swimming improved until she began to
swim in one or two beginner’s carnivals. Her parents then transferred to
Christchurch and she joined another Swimming Club. With their coaching she
continued to improve. Last New Zealand Open National Championships Kate
swam the finals of the women’s breaststroke. What a great job Kate has done.
The moral of the story though is, never prejudge anyone. You never know where
the next Popov or Thompson might be hiding

NOONECANGUARANTEESUCCESS
CHAPTER FIVE
“NO ONE CAN GUARANTEE SUCCESS —
BUT ONLY DESERVE IT”
I don’t know how many readers have ever run Auckland’s Waitakere Ranges
circuit. I guess the answer is not many. Some fine New Zealand runners – Snell,
Halberg, Walker, Quax, Magee and Dixon – became Olympic medallists on
Waitakere’s rugged slopes. All the physiological changes Lydiard predicted
happened as these accomplished athletes worked their way around its 24-mile
circuit. Their cardiovascular system improved. Their ability to run very fast
aerobically was developed. Their tolerance of anaerobic stress was conditioned.
Any weaknesses were harshly exposed in the long climb out of suburban
Auckland to the top of the Waitakere ranges. How long did Lydiard search to
find a road whose steepest kilometer is its last kilometer?
You seldom see New Zealand’s best runners up there anymore. They are too
busy doing track work at the Millennium Institute or sleeping in altitude tents on
the North Shore. That’s why Snell’s 1962 800m record is still the New Zealand
record. It beats me how all the sports science brains can’t figure out that the
Kenyans and Ethiopians don’t have a Millennium Institute and they can beat us,
no problem. What they do have though is a Kenyan and Ethiopian Waitakeres.
The difference is they run around theirs. When we run around ours again, we’ll
beat them again, absolutely certain.
Besides the physical, there is the mental effect. The sheer size of the Waitakeres.
The magnitude of the task Lydiard set means when you’ve done it there is
nothing left to prove. “If I can do that, I can do anything.” Out the back of the
Waitakeres you feel big just being there. When Alison qualified for her first
Commonwealth Games she flew back to London. As she came out of
immigration, the first thing she said to me was, ”Last weekend I ran the
Waitakeres for the first time!” That’s the way it is with that run. The
Commonwealth Games, fantastic, but the Waitakeres, a greater thing
altogether.

This swimming program encapsulates the same character. Who swims
100x100m? Who swims ten weeks of 100kms? Who swims seven days, every
week? Who swims sets of 2x3000m? Who swims three ten-kilometer sets every
week? Only you! The physiological effect happens and stays with you for the rest
of your life. You become stronger, fitter, faster and better than your under-
trained competition – and so you should. The work you do is harder, longer,
tougher and faster than anything they ever dreamed of. Sporting spin-doctors
can rabbit on about training smarter, it’s quality that counts, the benefits of
sports science and all the other snake oil. Meantime you’ll be halfway through
another set of 100x100m and leaving them behind at about the same speed as
they talk about it. The name of this chapter is an expression of Winston
Churchill. Like a lot of his sayings it sounds pompous and slightly silly these
days. But make no mistake – if you swim through all the preparation in this
book, you will deserve success – guaranteed.

A LITERARYMEDLEY
CHAPTER SIX
A LITERARY MEDLEY
Roger Robinson is three public things. He’s a fine writer, a Professor of English
and a winner of the Master’s Section of the New York Marathon. He’s actually
probably much more than this, but for now these three will suffice. Half way
through dinner at Arthur Lydiard’s place recently, Roger began to develop the
argument that sports writing and good writing seldom mixed. More needed to
be done to provide sports books with literary merit. As Arthur opened the night’s
fifth bottle of red wine – he is a generous host – Roger was providing examples
of sports books that passed the literary test and those that failed. One that failed
was a book that he had looked forward to reading about some well-known
runner. “Disappointingly,” he said,” The book turned out to be just a whole lot of
training schedules and race commentaries.” Even with all the wine I didn’t have
the courage to tell him my next sports book didn’t even have the race
commentaries, just training schedules.
However, what I did decide to do was hand over the last chapter of this book to
Jane Copland, better known as New Zealand’s best 200m breaststroke
swimmer, and let her have a shot at mixing sport and writing. I hope you enjoy
the result.
Butterfly
Where do butterflies go when it rains?
A little book I read once asked
Where do butterflies go?
And I can’t remember if they told us where
And in the end, I don’t really care.
Because I wear my butterfly into town
Strapped to my chest, and people stare.
It’s made of sequins, and it’s purple
And everything rhymes with that.

Midnight, Nice airport. For the benefit of Americans like Scott and Al, the aging
televisions are tuned to Eurosport, broadcast in English.
‘What are they doing?’ asks Scott.
‘I believe it’s called rugby,’ replies Al, chewing the edge of his polystyrene cup.
‘Rugby, James?’
Rugby. The game of being trampled over by twenty-nine rampaging New
Zealanders in front of 200 or so self-appointed experts in the pouring rain and
cold grey mud until half-time when I was inevitably substituted for a larger,
stupider form of humanity and sent to the bench to lick my wounds on my own.
Yes, Al. Rugby.
‘Who are they?’ asks Scott.
‘The ones in white are England and the others are Australia,’ I say, wondering if
maybe they are actually South Africa.
‘Are there any rules?’ asks Al.
‘Not really.’ I can’t think of any in particular.
‘Why do they stamp on their own players?’ says Scott, watching closely. I’m
thinking hard, but I can’t quite remember.
‘It’s called a ruck…’
Al snorts into his coffee.
‘It’s all about getting down the field to score a try.’
‘A what?’ Scott laughs. ‘A try?’
‘Yeah, so you get to try and kick a goal.’
‘So it’s like a touch-down.’
I nod, agreeing. ‘It is a touch-down.’
‘And so then someone goes and kicks. Did you kick? Or did you ruck?’
‘I ran around the outside looking for someone to pass me the ball.’
‘And did they?’
‘Not often. I was…that one. There. Number nine.’
‘He’s quite small,’ says Scott.
‘So am I,’ I say.
‘So you are,’ says Al as he changes the channel.

Breaststroke
Three seconds later, my head came out of the water. There were lights in my
eyes and a boiling rush. Eighteen seconds, although if things weren’t going my
way it would be longer. I thought, the quicker this is over, the better.
I was forced to think. Things behind me might catch me. I might be brought to
face my past again. I was a bridesmaid a year ago in Dunedin. I was just a
flower girl in Wellington, six months later. I was always turned away. Tonight, I
thought, I was going to get married.
There was so much noise. Intermittent noise, when my head broke the surface.
Human noise. Who was shouting? Shouting never saved anyone, never caught
anyone, never won anything.
I was reminded of horses. I was reminded of many things. I was reminded of the
horse race we watched that afternoon, from Hastings. They lined up and raced
and the horses couldn’t see anything but what was directly in front of them.
Their jockeys whipped them until Cinder Bella went from last to first and passed
the top three on the line to win, and Arthur was on his way to the double. I
wonder if my father’s friend Trevor is going to win the double tonight.
Sometimes I thought of music. I thought of the race from above, like a whirling
camera at a pop show. I was underneath one of those whirling cameras two
weeks ago in Sydney. My favorite Australian band was playing live at the
Olympic Park. I shouted and waved at the whirling camera. It’s not difficult to
get on TV, just as it isn’t difficult to sit and watch horse races on Saturday
afternoons, or to shout and have me hear you, intermittently, not when I was
underwater, searching down there for something, if only I had my eyes open.
Maybe I did have my eyes open. I didn’t see the lines or the ropes, but I saw all I
should.
I saw the end. My past – the ugly, silver bridesmaids’ dresses and those of the
equally drab, brown flower girls – wanted me to stay. There were ten meters
remaining and clear water either side of me. I swam, ecstatic with pain, into the
wall.

A calendar, hanging on the wall of the kitchen, tells Yana there are fifteen days
left in July, the seventh month of the year. Fifteen days, eight hours and ten
minutes, although her father sets the clock on the microwave five minutes fast.
‘Keeps you punctual,’ Yana’s mother echoes every now and then.
If there are fifteen days, eight hours and ten minutes left in July, and five months
until January, then there are 168 days until the first day of Next Year.
Her father likes private schools. He, Ryan, likes clean red brick and green
concrete, sharp pleats and crisp white collars. He belongs to the National Party
and doesn’t express an opinion on anything. He can talk for half an hour and
say nothing at all.
Yana’s father is passionate about rugby. He wants her to play netball. Whistle
blowing Saturday mornings and red knees, mini-buses taking teams to
Masterton, pilling bibs, stepping, goal defense; obstruction wing attack! At
school, the A netball team sit at the front in Maths, the back in English, with their
legs together in assembly but spread on Saturday night. They cut their
fingernails for sport, but their claws are bared for special occasions.
From Yana’s home in Wadestown, she can see Wellington Girls’ College. Two
main buildings, grey and orange, rise up from the safe and wise asphalt of
Thorndon. Teal uniforms peel off trains at eight-fifteen. Chewing gum, shirts out,
stretched jerseys and bags slung casually, casually, they are ogled by the
Wellington College boys sweeping by on the bus. The third form College boys at
the Highland Park shops give Yana the fingers, not realising how much she
envies them.
Yana’s bus winds through the suburbs, stopping intermittently to on-load more
clean, green blazers and skirts. Wadestown has its dairy, its hairdresser and its
church, but Wilton is less fortunate. The hill up to Karori is bordered by toi-toi;
the fire station at the top almost ironic, mocking, as though someone is worried
the native shrubbery might take light. The school gates, sturdy and far from
chicken-wire, snarl ‘No dogs allowed!‘ Was it too much to wish for that to be
true?

The year’s end is highly anticipated. On February the first she will not take the
bus back to the school and its sabre-toothed population, the calendar in the
kitchen replaced by a (surprise! Gosh, I’d never have guessed...) new edition
offered on Christmas Day. An education, received for thousands of dollars, is
being resented more and more with every blink of the clock, every turn of the
bus wheel under Yana’s well-covered, tartan bottom. She is to join the state
school riffraff, her father grudgingly approving her escape to Thorndon’s
government funded paradise.
She knows the Karori fire station is there for a reason. One day she will watch
them all burn.
