Since I’ve been swimming all my life, acknowledging everyone who has
contributed in some way to the information found between the covers
of this book seems a more formidable task than writing the book itself!
But here goes. I’d like to thank:
My parents, Leon and Dorothea, who introduced me to the
wonders of the water at a very early age.
My sisters, Elaine and June, who have always been supportive
of my swimming endeavors, and have shared their expertise as
well.

hroughout history, water has been used to promote and restore
health. In aqua sana est (Water is healthy) was chiseled by the Romans
into the walls of their baths. And, whatever reasons the Romans had for
crediting water as a source of well-being, we now know that its physical
properties have a health-promoting effect. This promotion of health
through swimming has been the spark behind the work of Dr. Jane Katz.
In her book she sets forth a fitness program using modern training
methods developed from her experience as both a teacher and a
competitive swimmer. This book, which is addressed to the fledgling
swimmer as much as to the experienced one, shows swimming to be a
satisfying and healthy way to physical fitness.
Swimming has many advantages over other sports. Most aerobic
activities (that is, those that make us out of breath), such as jogging,
tennis, climbing, and aerobic dancing, place stress on the weight-bearing
joints and the lumbar spine. Swimming, on the other hand, gives an
aerobic effect with less stress to the joints. In addition, moving the arms
and legs against the resistance of the water is the equivalent of
exercising with weights, but since water doesn’t allow any sudden,
harmful movements, the risk of injury is lowered. Also, swimming
exercises both sides of the body equally. Out of the water, only cross-
country skiing even approaches this symmetrical effect.
Although swimming is ideal for people of any age, it is particularly
beneficial for the older person. By the age of sixty or seventy, many
people who are in otherwise excellent health are hampered in sports by
minor hypertrophic arthritic changes in the spine and the weight-bearing
joints, which can make it rather difficult to jog, play tennis, or take part
in other sporting activities. For these people, swimming is an excellent
way to reap the aerobic benefits of running or tennis without incurring

--- Page 13 Text ---
any pain. In the water, the weight-bearing stress of the vertical position
is eliminated, there is less stress on the joints during the contraction of
the muscles, and what stress there is is distributed equally throughout
the joints. For these reasons swimming is a very useful therapeutic
activity for many locomotion problems. In fact, the swimmer can do
much by himself to contribute to his own rehabilitation, thereby often
shortening an otherwise long and expensive process.
In addition, recent reports show that often youngsters who are not
able to participate in sports like track or soccer because of some
respiratory illness such as asthma can become successful competitive
swimmers. The air near the surface of the water is freer of dust and
other pollutants, and it has been shown that exhaling against the
resistance of the water can dilate the bronchi. Furthermore, everyone,
not only asthmatics, can benefit from the efficient breathing techniques
learned in swimming.
Whatever statistics one reads, one sees that swimmers have a much
lower frequency of injury than participants in virtually any other sport. I
do not know of anybody of any age who cannot learn to swim, and I do
not know of anyone who has regretted doing so.
Jane Katz, Ed.D., is a professor of health and physical education at
Bronx Community College and John Jay College of Criminal Justice of
the City University of New York. Her academic achievements and her
experience as a member of international swimming and synchronized
swimming teams make her aptly suited to write an excellent,
instructional book on swimming. Swimming for Total Fitness gives, in
easily understood form, a program that will prepare the beginner for
pleasurable and beneficial swimming and that will also help the
experienced swimmer to sharpen his skills. Structures of the locomotion
system change continuously as we mature, but swimming is one activity
that can be performed with impunity at any age. Youngsters, busy
executives, homemakers, and other persons who want to engage in an
aerobic activity with an extremely low incidence of injury will derive
much benefit from studying Dr. Jane Katz’s book and following her
program.

t falls from the sky, and it comes out of the ground. Two thirds of your
body is made of it. It keeps your skin from wrinkling, flowers from
wilting. You wash with it, drink it, cook with it. Kids love to play in it,
wars have been fought over it. Three quarters of the earth is covered
with it. Some believe it cleanses the soul and purifies the mind. What is
it? It’s water—and it’s also what makes swimming unique in the world of
sports and physical fitness.
You know by now that exercise is good for you—physically, mentally,
even emotionally. But how should you exercise? As doctors in sports
medicine have focused more closely on sports-related injuries, they have
learned that some sports, although in some ways good for you, can also
be downright bad. How many runners do you know without shin splints,
for instance, or how many tennis players do you know who don’t
complain of tennis elbow? And many sports seem like fun initially but
soon prove boring, or expensive, or limited in scope (or all three). No
wonder people hesitate to begin a program or, once they start, become
disillusioned and give it up so easily. Broken arms, bad knees, hours of
grueling, sweaty work, depleted bank accounts should not be the price
you have to pay for physical fitness.
And it’s not—if you swim! Swimming has something special: you do it
in water. And that’s a plus. Water is the secret ingredient that makes
swimming better for you than any other sport. Did you know, for
example, that every time a runner’s foot hits the ground his body
receives a shock of up to three times his or her body weight? (Multiply
that by 3,000 strides for every mile run, and you’re talking about an
incredible pounding.) On the other hand, a swimmer’s body feels as
though it weighs less in water, owing to the upward force of buoyancy.
And there’s no jarring against any hard surface: there’s only the smooth,

--- Page 16 Text ---
rhythmic motion through the water. That’s not to say you shouldn’t run
at all. But that extra wear and tear can add up over time, if dry-land
exercise is the mainstay of your fitness program. More and more people
are discovering that their feet, leg muscles, knees, and hip joints simply
cannot stand up over the years to that kind of constant pounding. That’s
why swimming is the sport of the future—it lets you fulfill your fitness
quota without the harmful side effects that land sports can bring.
Swimming is the closest thing on this earth to a perfect sport. It
exercises all the major muscles of the body; it’s the inexpensive, fun,
social, graceful, sensual, safe, gentle way to achieve fitness—and it’s an
activity that you can enjoy for a lifetime. It can also be an athletic,
artistic, intellectual, and spiritual challenge, depending upon how you
want to go. So give swimming a try. But I warn you. You may never
want to get out of the water. You’ll find swimming one of the few things
that successfully combine business (in this case, physical fitness) with
pleasure.
Swimming is still among the most popular sports activities in the
United States. According to the 1992 National Sporting Goods
Association, over 66 million Americans went swimming at least once
during the year. A 1990 Gallup poll affirms this participation: 38 percent
of those polled said they participated in swimming that year: followed
by fishing at 29 percent, running and jogging at 19 percent, and aerobic
dance at 13 percent. So come join us … get in the swim!

HAT WIMMING ILL O FOR OU
Swimming has a lot going for it. But first I want to say a few words
about what sets it apart from all the rest—water. That’s because an
appreciation of the water is one of the most important aspects of
discovering the joys and benefits of swimming.
What’s so special about water? Plenty! First of all, how long and hard
will you work at something if you aren’t deriving some pleasure from it?
Not very long and not very hard. The fact that something is “good for
you” isn’t really enough in the long run. Whether it’s running or
swimming—or eating your vegetables—if you do it only because you
“should” and not because you like it, you’ll soon find excuses for

--- Page 17 Text ---
stopping.
But water feels good and is good—for your body and for your soul. In
water, our bodies seem to defy gravity, and we come as close as we ever
will to the feeling of flying. And water is a wonderfully sensuous
medium; just being in it is relaxing and exhilarating at the same time. In
water every motion seems effortless, our muscles relax, and our mental
walls seem to melt and float away.
Most people, no matter what their age, find water deliciously
pleasurable and soothing. When you’re tense or you have an ache
somewhere—especially if you suffer from a back problem—don’t you
think about how nice it would be to soak your troubles away in a
soothing whirlpool or bath?
But water’s greatest advantage is its buoyancy. This buoyant quality is
the swimmer’s secret ally. The buoyancy is always there—holding you
up while you’re in the water, and keeping you feeling “up” long after
you’ve wiped the last droplet from your skin. Water lifts your spirits as
well as your body. After a swim, there’s a euphoria that permeates your
entire existence for hours afterward.
But enough of swimming’s seemingly magical properties. What will it
do for you in scientific terms?
It Helps Your Heart, Blood Vessels, and Lungs. Swimming is an
excellent aerobic (heart-pumping) exercise, which means that if you do it
regularly and vigorously enough to raise your heartbeat to 70 percent of
its Maximum Rate (see Target Rate, this page) for a half hour or more,
your cardiovascular system will gradually grow stronger and more
efficient. By making your system work this way (in a sensible,
progressive manner), you train your body to handle the extra demand,
and it even becomes able to function better under normal conditions,
when the strain is removed. This is known as the training effect When
you exercise aerobically, your lungs actually increase in size, capacity,
and efficiency. Your heart becomes more powerful, more fit with
exercise, just like any other muscle. Your blood vessels actually increase
in number, and they may even become more flexible, thereby
forestalling any tendency toward arteriosclerosis. Some studies also
indicate that aerobic exercise reduces the cholesterol levels in the blood

--- Page 18 Text ---
overall, and that it may alter the cholesterol that is found in the blood to
a less dangerous type. Other aerobic benefits include lower blood
pressure, improved digestion, a clearer complexion, and generally
increased alertness. Aerobic exercise can also help alleviate the stress
that can put a lethal strain on the heart, and, finally, if you’re
overweight, the weight reduction that usually goes hand in hand with
vigorous exercise (more on this below) will further alleviate the strain
on your heart.
Swimming has this added effect: when your body is horizontal and
immersed in water, your heart is actually larger than when you’re
vertical on dry land and it has to pump against gravity. As a result,
between 10 and 20 percent more blood is pumped with each heart
contraction. This effect gives you the potential to work harder and
longer than you ever could on land. And it makes swimming the ideal
(and sometimes the only) exercise available to those who suffer from
heart disease.
It Gives You Stronger, Firmer Muscles. Swimming is the single best
exercise for toning your arms, shoulders, waistline, hips, and legs all at
once. And since the water cushions and supports your body, your
chances of straining a muscle are greatly reduced.
It Increases Flexibility. Swimming’s long, sinuous motions, along with
the increased range of movement that your body has in the water,
actually elongate your muscles while strengthening them. Swimming
will help loosen you up—both in the water and after you’re out.
It’s Easy on Your Muscles and Bones. One of the best things about
swimming is that it gives you all of the pleasures and benefits of
exercising without the troublesome and often painful side effects that
other sports can have on your musculoskeletal system. It’s the whole-
body, all-around exercise that builds endurance and balanced muscle
strength, without jarring your bones and muscles. Because the resistance
of the water actually helps you exercise your muscles, because the
movements are relatively slow and rhythmic, and because you aren’t

--- Page 19 Text ---
likely to collide with other people or with equipment—the average
swimmer has virtually no injuries to worry about. In fact, swimming’s
the one exercise that doctors—especially sports medicine specialists—
unfailingly recommend to those who have sustained injuries in other
sports, or in life.
The fact that swimming puts a minimum of strain on the joints of your
body is especially good news for those with arthritis or chronic back
problems, since it’s often the only exercise these people can perform. It’s
also good news for those who want to avoid these problems in the
future.
It Helps You Lose Weight. In order to lose weight, your body must use
more calories than it takes in. Swimming will help greatly here (see this
page). And although light or moderate exercise can stimulate the
appetite, studies (and personal experience) have shown that strenuous
exercise may actually diminish your desire to eat. After a vigorous swim,
the last thing you’ll want to do is stuff yourself. (That’s why it’s a good
idea to schedule a swim before the biggest meal of the day.)
More importantly, exercise helps raise your metabolism—the rate at
which your body burns up calories—not only during exercise, but for
hours afterward. Even long after you’re out of the pool, in other words,
your swimming will still be helping you to lose weight. Finally,
swimming is so relaxing that it may even help you control compulsive
overeating brought on by tension.
It’s Good for Overweight Persons. If you’re on the heavy side, your
adipose tissue makes you even more buoyant than your svelter
counterparts. This extra support is why you’re more comfortable
swimming than doing any other sort of exercise. And being overweight
doesn’t slow you down nearly as much as it does on land; in fact, some
swimmers—especially headline-making long-distance swimmers—have
an extra layer of fat for warmth.
It Aids Physical Therapy. Water’s buoyancy also makes swimming an
excellent therapeutic exercise. It gradually and gently relaxes and

--- Page 20 Text ---
rehabilitates muscles and joints that for one reason or another have
atrophied or stiffened. Swimming is a sport that can be enjoyed by the
injured and by the handicapped. The therapeutic benefits of immersing
yourself in water are well documented, and doctors often recommend
swimming to their patients who need a gentle, soothing form of activity
for a temporary injury. Water is so safe, in fact, that nature uses it to
protect us during the most vulnerable time of our lives—while we’re still
developing in our mother’s womb.
It Helps You to Enjoy Other Sports and Other People. Your newfound
energy and endurance will allow you to enjoy dry-land activities such as
tennis or dancing till dawn. And love-making, too: the sensual swimmer
knows how pleasurable it is to use one’s muscles to move through the
water; how it heightens physical strength, flexibility, and the awareness
of one’s body. And this is not simply the power of suggestion, or wishful
thinking. Science has shown that swimming actually helps one feel
“sexier” temporarily by affecting the body’s hormonal balance. A study
made of 258 swimmers (108 women and 150 men) found that 20
percent said they enjoyed a higher rate of sexual activity after they’d
begun to swim regularly.
It Slows Down the Clock. Lack of exercise is the most important factor
in premature aging. Our bodies actually thrive on use. Up to a point, the
more you do, the more you can do. In other words, use it or lose it.
Regular exercise can add years to your life. And if your sport exercise
is swimming, it can continue to help slow the aging process for as long
as you live. I’ve seen many persons sixty years and older who swim two
miles or more every day. You should see the shape they’re in. Most forty-
year-olds would kill to look like that!
And did you know that some conditioned sixty-year-olds can swim 60–
70 pecent as fast as conditioned twenty-year-olds? If you swim for
fitness, statistics show that you’ll lose only about 1 percent of your
ability per year. And as the years go by you’ll still be perfecting your
technique, so that it’s actually possible that your performance will
improve over time.

--- Page 21 Text ---
It Provides Lifelong Satisfaction and Competition. First of all,
perfecting your swimming can bring you the unbeatable satisfaction of
mastering a skill. You don’t have to be an Olympic swimmer to enjoy
pushing your abilities to the limit. You can always satisfy your urge to
compete by swimming against your previous times and distances, or by
racing informally with a group of friends. Or, thanks to the Masters
Swimming Program, begun in 1970, you can engage in an organized
competition against others in your own age group. The YMCAs and
YMHAs across the country have also instituted this popular swimming
program as part of their regular aquatic schedule.
The Masters Program is unique in that it provides recreational, social,
and competitive programs that people can enjoy throughout their lives.
Most other sports programs become too strenuous later in life, and the
competition with younger and stronger athletes becomes too frustrating.
But in the Masters Program, there are people in their eighties, nineties,
and even a centenarian or two competing in swimming meets
throughout the United States—and the world. So, not only can you be
swimming through the ’90s; you can swim into your nineties!
It’s Inexpensive. Swimming is an exercise that can fit everyone’s
budget, since it can cost as little as the price of a bathing suit. And
swimming doesn’t usually involve travel expenses, club membership, or
fancy equipment. All you need is water! In fact, a recent comparison
survey found that a swimmer spends less than half the money on
equipment that he would for any other sport.
It’s Varied. So you think a swimming workout consists of jumping into
a pool and swimming away, lap after endless lap, for as long as you can?
Have I got news for you! Just turn to the workouts that begin on this
page, for a glimpse of how varied a swim can be.
First of all, there are four competitive strokes from which to choose
(crawl or freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly). Then there
are the recreational and resting strokes and skills (elementary
backstroke, sculling, sidestroke, and treading skills), plus their
variations. During a workout you can do each stroke while pulling (using

--- Page 22 Text ---
only the arms), or kicking (just the legs), or swimming (using both arms
and legs). You can vary the pace by swimming fast, slow, or in between.
You can swim against the clock or at your own internal pace. You can
swim long distances, short distances, or middle distances. You can try
equipment such as fins, kickboards, hand paddles, and pull-buoys (see
this page-this page). And for each stroke, you have any number of dives,
starts, and turns to practice each time you swim. And that’s not even
counting water exercises, deep-water running, etc. So you see, unlike
many other aerobic or all-around exercises, swimming is anything but
monotonous.
S I W Y M I
WIMMING S HAT OU AKE T
You have your own special reasons for swimming. It can be for fitness,
appearance, pleasure, or all three. Your reasons may change over the
years, but no matter what your reason for exercising, fitness, as a friend
of mine once pointed out, is one of the few things in life that’s fair.
We’re all born with different levels of ability, but within our
limitations each of us has a tremendous amount of material to work
with. It’s a shame when we don’t work up to our potential. In order to
get into and remain in the best physical condition that he can be, that
rich guy over there with the two Rolls-Royces and the private swimming
pool has to work just as hard as that factory worker, hassled executive,
housekeeper, or you. In other words, regardless of who you are, you’ll
get as much out of swimming as you put into it. What could be fairer
than that?
Life has its competitive moments, no matter how much you may try to
avoid them. And what you learn about yourself through swimming can
help you over the roughest spots. For one thing, you’ll have to assess
your abilities objectively—past, present, and future. For another, the
discipline involved in sticking to a swimming program increases your
self-esteem. To see your distance grow, your skills improve, your body
strengthen—that’s a good feeling. And your ability to set goals and to
achieve them will carry over into other parts of your life. Even if you
don’t achieve all your goals, it’s no disaster—that will help you develop

--- Page 23 Text ---
a healthy acceptance of disappointment as well as fulfillment.
Swimming can be as social or solitary an endeavor as you like. You
can join a team or swim club, go to meets and compete, and get your
friends and family involved. Or you can compete against yourself in
order to achieve strictly personal goals. You can reserve your swim as a
private little pocket of time that’s yours and yours alone. What’s great
about swimming is you don’t have to spend time looking for a partner or
team, but if you feel like company, you have the option.
And swimming can be your answer to this modern-day poser: Is there
life without television? Here’s one healthful alternative to the passive
life, or what I call “spectatoritis.” No more sitting around, waiting for,
and accepting the prepackaged material that someone else has decided
you want. When you swim, you become your own “live entertainment”
and become more of a part of life—a doer, instead of an observer.
I hope by now you’re eager to take the plunge. But first you have to
know a few things about my program.

HOM HIS OOK S OR
This book is for you if:
You’re an adult who has tried to learn to swim in the past, but
without success.
You can swim a little but want to learn swim skills better.
(Haven’t you said or heard, “I can swim but I can’t breathe”?)
You’re an accomplished swimmer who wants to review your
skills and refine your technique.
You’re a swimming instructor or coach who wants to improve
the effectiveness of your classes.
You’re a person who is looking for a progressive aerobic fitness
program.
If you don’t swim now, this book will teach you how to swim—and
swim correctly. That’s a promise. Over the past thirty years, I’ve used
these techniques with thousands of die-hard landlubbers of all shapes,
sizes, ages, and abilities.
So, whether you’re young or just young at heart, a total beginner or an
experienced swimmer, whether you’re swimming solo or with one or
more partners, or even if you need a competent guide to help you teach
others—this book is designed for you.
H T U T B
OW O SE HIS OOK
This book can be used in several ways, whether you want to learn how
to swim, to improve your skills at any level, to raise and to maintain
your level of fitness, or to compete:
By Yourself. Everything you need to learn is here, divided into easy-
to-understand progressive steps. Just follow the lessons and workouts
carefully, on your own. For safety’s sake, though, always be sure there is
someone else around the water—preferably a lifeguard. Even the most

--- Page 25 Text ---
accomplished swimmers obey this rule: never enter the water unless
there is another person present who can help in case of an emergency.
Along with a Partner or Buddy. This is the best in terms of moral
support, fun, and incentive. It’s always nice to have someone else
around, especially if he or she is at about the same level you are. A little
companionship, help, and reassurance make anything go easier and
faster, and swimming together can do wonders for a relationship. Instead
of a night on the town, try a Saturday night at the pool!
As a Guide to Help You Teach Others. Swimming instructors, my
fellow Masters fitness swimmers, and students alike have asked me to
write a book for years. (Stop bothering me already.) Here it is!
This book takes a careful, step-by-step approach to swimming and
fitness. Each lesson or workout builds the skills you’ve acquired in the
previous one. I indicate which skills and what level of fitness you should
bring with you to each level; you can find the place that’s best for you to
begin the program. Similarly, you can progress as far as you want. I do
recommend, though, that no matter what level of swimming or fitness
you think you’re at you:
at least review “The Fundamentals of Swimming”
end your program no sooner than Level 10 of the Intermediate
Phase
consider progressing to the Advanced Phase and at least look at
the chapter on Super Workouts!
Part One, “The Fundamentals of Swimming,” consists of ten lessons.
The first lesson goes right to the heart of the matter by teaching you how
to exhale underwater comfortably. This is the mainstay of swimming
well and the one thing that most people—even those who know the
basics—have trouble with. The lessons in this section then go on to teach
you the basic prone and supine swimming skills, as well as how to dive.
So begin here, even if you were the star sprinter for your high school or
college swim team. Your strokes might have become a bit sloppy, your
memory of the finer points a bit shaky; your endurance might have

--- Page 26 Text ---
dropped way off; or you may have been doing something incorrectly all
along. Experienced swimmers can probably zip right through this
section. If you can, you won’t have to spend much time on it. And if you
can’t, it means it’s a good thing you began here.
The lessons in this first section are also mini-workouts, designed to
improve gradually your fitness level along with your skills. Each one
becomes progressively more strenuous than the last, so that once you’re
through with the fundamentals you’re ready to follow the workouts,
which pick up where the fundamentals left off. These workout programs
have four phases—Beginners, Intermediate, Advanced, and a special
section of Super Workouts that has training tips and high-caliber
workouts similar to the ones that competitive swimmers use to get into
tiptop shape. The workouts gradually bring your distance up to 300
yards or meters (almost a quarter mile) for Beginners; 1,000 yards or
meters (over a half mile) for Intermediates; 1,800 yards or meters (over
a mile) for Advanced swimmers; and finally 3,000 yards or meters
(almost two miles) for Super swimmers—while they expand your
repertoire of swimming skills.

ATER ATER VERYWHERE
As for where to swim, there are facilities all over the place—if you look.
The last time the National Spa and Pool Institute took a count (in
1991) there were a total of almost three and a half million outdoor in-
ground pools in the United States, and nearly three million outdoor
above-ground pools. And that’s not counting innumerable indoor pools
and natural bodies of water—oceans, rivers, lakes, ponds, streams, bays,
and in quarries—that are just begging for you to jump in and have a
good time. As to when to swim, you can do it summer, winter, all year
round.
If you prefer a pool (which I recommend for learning, practicing, and
most workouts), you’ll find that most facilities have low fees. Many
localities maintain public pools that charge nominal fees, if any. Call the
local Y, school board, community center, parks and recreation
department, community colleges, universities, or continuing education
programs. Or you might prefer to join one of the growing number of

--- Page 27 Text ---
private health clubs and “spas” where you can enjoy steam rooms,
saunas, massage, and other exercise facilities.
If you’re an advanced swimmer, try to work out with a local swim
club, team, or Y, with an understanding coach. If you’re interested, call
your local Masters swimming office. Often, they’ll help you locate swim
teams and coaches. In addition, articles in swim magazines are often
helpful in locating this information.
F T
INDING THE IME
To derive the most benefit, you should exercise at least three times a
week for approximately thirty minutes each time. I can hear the
complaints now: “But I don’t have that much time!” Take it from me, if
you want to swim and reap the benefits, you’ll find the time. Rearrange
your priorities. I know people who get up early and join a workout
before they run off to put in a whole day’s work. Believe me, you’ll feel
better the whole day through! If you can persuade your friends or family
to join you, so much the better.
As to what time of day to swim, that depends on you. I usually swim
in the morning, and whether you’re doing workouts or learning the
fundamentals, you might like to start the day this way too. Others prefer
to swim during their lunch break—what a great way to recharge your
batteries for the afternoon! Still others find that the best time for them is
after work, since exercise helps you unwind from daily pressures. If you
don’t work nine to five, you can visit the pool during the late morning or
early afternoon, when it’s often less crowded. You can even swim late at
night as a way to relax before going to bed. Some people find late night
swimming too stimulating, but others, especially after whirlpool or hot
shower, are ready to drift off into a sound sleep.
I B B S
T’S ETTER TO E AFE
Before starting this or any exercise program, even at a beginning level,
it’s a good idea to check first with your doctor and, at his or her
discretion, perhaps have a complete physical examination. This is

--- Page 28 Text ---
especially important if you are in your middle years and have been
getting no regular exercise. On the other hand, whatever your age, once
your doctor gives you the go-ahead, you can look forward to a regular
swimming program knowing that this is an ageless activity—one in
which you can participate virtually all your life. It is a lifetime
investment with increasing dividends.

ll good swimming begins with a firm grasp of the basic water skills. If
you’ve never swum before, or have had only a smattering of experience,
this section is a must. Even if you feel you know the basics, you’ll benefit
from reviewing them. You may or may not learn something new, but
you’ll definitely be able to clean up your act.
This section consists of ten lessons. Each lesson has two main parts
—“Dry-Land/Prep Skills” and “Water Skills.” Everything you do in the
water you will first have practiced—and mastered—on land. Once the
dry-land exercises have become second nature, you’ll move on to the
water skills. As you will see, it’s not that difficult to take skills that
you’ve acquired on land and transfer them to another medium.
W -U , C -D , H
ARM PS OOL OWNS OMEWORK
You begin each water session with the warm-up, which includes a pool-
side review of the dry-land/prep skills and basic water exercises. The
warm-up is an important aspect of every lesson, since it gradually
prepares both your mind and your body for what’s to come. It gets your
blood moving and your breath going, and it makes the water feel more
inviting.
Each lesson also includes a cool-down after each swim. Like a warm-
up in reverse, a cool-down lets your metabolism slow back down
gradually, which is the way your body prefers to do things.
The water-skills part of each lesson includes a section called
“Homework,” which lets you review your newly acquired skills at home
after you’ve had a chance to practice them in the water. If you’re using
the “buddy” system, it’s a good idea to do your homework together too.

Go slowly at first, and be sure to practice every step. If you’re a
beginning, this advice will be easy to follow. Not so for the experienced
swimmer … but even if you know the basics, don’t skip over and don’t
skip around. Review the skills in each lesson, going through them all,
one by one. Even if you’re sure you already know a particular skill,
review it—you may be surprised to discover that you’ve learned it
incorrectly or that you can improve upon what you already know. And,
as you go through the program, you’ll notice an increase in your energy
and endurance, as well as your ability.

ELP
The basic “swim aid” you’ll be using during this program is a kickboard
(and even that’s optional). Many pools don’t allow devices of any kind,
and besides, they’re an expense, and they can be a nuisance to carry
around. I also feel that beginning swimmers can become too dependent
on flotation devices. However, if you like it and only rely on it
temporarily to get you through a particularly stubborn phase, by all
means use one. Just realize that, at some point, it’ll have to go. And once
you’ve mastered the basics, there are several pieces of equipment, such
as swim fins, that I do recommend to help you master other strokes and
to fine-tune your technique.
H L H O
OW ONG? OW FTEN?
It’s up to you. Unless you’re the type of person who needs to set up a
real schedule, just repeat each lesson—or the most troublesome parts of
it—until you’ve mastered each skill. Just keep practicing at your own
pace until you feel confident enough to take the next step. There are no
schedules to follow here, no class bells to signal that it’s time to stop.
Do the dry-land/prep skills as often as possible—while watching TV,
talking on the phone, as a substitute coffee break, even when you’re
taking a bath—any time you think of it. You’re on dry land most of the
time, but in this program that’s no excuse for not practicing your
swimming skills. The better you become at doing something out of the

--- Page 32 Text ---
water, the better you’ll do in the water. (And, incidentally, it also means
not having to refer to this book while you’re pool-side.)
As for the water skills: try to get into the water at least once a week. If
possible, go three times a week; every other day is ideal for most people.
The more you’re in the water, the faster you’ll progress. The duration of
each session depends on your ambition, energy, comfort, and daily
schedule. In general, though, I recommend that you go through the
entire lesson the first time. This should keep you in the water about
thirty minutes. After that, you needn’t go through the whole lesson every
time. Instead, you can practice just the particular skill or skills that you
feel need the most work; and this might take only five, ten, or fifteen
minutes of your time.
L T B M
ET HERE E USIC
You might find it helpful (if it doesn’t disturb others) to bring a radio or
a tape player along to the pool, so that you can play your favorite music
while you warm up, or maybe even during your lesson. This helps to
create a relaxed, familiar atmosphere that’s energizing at the same time.
Swimming, when done correctly, is almost like dancing in the water,
because you’re moving gracefully and rhythmically. To do that, you
need to be fully relaxed—that’s the whole key to successful swimming.
At some pools, in fact, you’ll find music already piped in.
You should feel comfortable in the water. Once you’ve achieved that,
everything else will follow easily and naturally. So do whatever you can
to help you to relax. If you find yourself feeling tense, tell yourself to
loosen up. Try not to fight your body’s natural buoyancy. My years of
teaching have taught me this over and over again: your most powerful—
and sometimes troublesome—“muscle” is your brain. Once your mind is
on your side, the rest will come in time.
If you can’t do the strokes exactly as described, that’s okay. Your body
may not have the flexibility required, and this will probably improve the
more you practice and loosen up. Just do the best you can, following the
text and pictures as closely as possible, and remember, there’s always
room for individuality. Even in the world of competitive swimming, no
two swimmers move exactly alike.

--- Page 33 Text ---
Above all, have a positive outlook. TRY! If you’re hesitant about
learning a new skill, just give yourself a chance. Millions of people have
done it before. So can you. And you’ll have fun!

his is among the most important lessons in the book, because it
establishes the groundwork on which all the others are based. In this
lesson, you’ll begin to learn how to breathe correctly, how to enter the
pool safely, how to feel comfortable in the water, and how to bob and
flutter kick.
D -L /P S
RY AND REP KILLS
This lesson begins by teaching you how to overcome what, for many
people—regardless of their swimming ability—is the biggest stumbling
block of all: incorrect breathing.
Breathing
Begin by sitting up straight. Inhale, expanding your lungs fully. Then
exhale.
Remember how it feels to have your lungs really full—they should feel
this way every time you take a breath in the water. As you do the
following exercises, try to think about nothing except your mouth and
nose, isolating them from the rest of your body.
HOW TO DO IT
The Mouth: Pinch your nostrils shut. Purse your lips and inhale
strongly through your mouth—pretend you’re drinking through a straw.
Then, keeping your lips pursed, exhale just as strongly through your

--- Page 35 Text ---
mouth, as though you’re cooling off a cup of hot coffee. Hold a hand in
front of your mouth to feel the expelled air. Repeat this ten times,
breathing as deeply as you can.
The Nose: Cover your mouth and inhale deeply through your nose, as
though you were smelling your favorite food cooking. Then exhale once
again, expelling the air hard—as if there’s too much pepper in the dish
and you now need to sneeze. Repeat this ten times, each time breathing
as deeply as you can.
Now inhale deeply through both your nose and your mouth. Although
you may be inhaling more through your mouth, use your nasal passage
as well. Exhale strongly. Begin by pretending that you’re cooling off that
coffee with your mouth first and then continue to sneeze from the
pepper at the same time. Repeat this ten times.
All this deep breathing may make you a little lightheaded. That’s
because you’re getting more oxygen than you really need (in other
words, you’re hyperventilating). Don’t worry, though—you won’t get
that same dizziness in the water, because your body will be using the
extra oxygen.
EXTRA TIPS
Make your inhale/exhale cycles as strong, even, and continuous as
possible; try to get to the point where you can maintain an even stream
of air for fifteen seconds. But build up to it gradually—you may find it
harder than it sounds.
All new swimmers worry that the water will go into their mouths and
noses. But remember this: the air flow you create when you blow out
through both your nose and your mouth makes it physically impossible
for the water to go up your breathing passages. As long as you’re
breathing air out, no water can get in.
In the water, the nose is especially important. Most people will
naturally exhale through the mouth underwater, but too many people
don’t exhale properly out the nose at the same time, and as a result the

--- Page 36 Text ---
nasal passages tend to be a perpetual problem. Therefore, be especially
aware of utilizing your nose as you do these breathing exercises.
If you have trouble exhaling through both nose and mouth
simultaneously, begin by exhaling through your mouth alone for a
second, before joining it with the nose. If that isn’t comfortable, try the
reverse order—first the nose for a second, then nose and mouth together.
The main difference between your normal breathing and your
breathing while swimming is in the volume of air that you take in and
blow out. Normally, you breathe very shallowly, using only a fraction of
your total lung capacity. But when you’re swimming, you’ll inhale very
deeply when your face is out of the water, through both your nose and
your mouth. And when your head is under the water, you’ll blow out
hard, also through both nose and mouth, creating that protective air
flow as you do so.
These exercises are also the first step in building up your
cardiovascular endurance. As you take these deep breaths now, you’re
also strengthening and expanding your chest muscles and developing
your lungs, which will help you later on in the water. Remember, even if
you know how to swim, if your breathing isn’t comfortable, you can’t go
very far—your swimming will be limited to only a few minutes.
Breathing
The next step is to get your face wet up to your hairline—and put that
air flow to work.
HOW TO DO IT
Fill a large container with water. You can use anything—a big bowl, a
large pot, your kitchen or bathroom sink, or even a bathtub.
Lean forward and just barely touch your chin to the surface of the
water. Inhale, taking a deep breath, using both your nose and your
mouth. Exhale through both your nose and your mouth, and watch the
water. Ripples should form on the surface. If the water remains still,
exhale harder next time. Repeat this ten times, making sure that the
water moves each time. If you’re practicing with a buddy, check each

--- Page 37 Text ---
other to make sure you’re breathing correctly.
Next, inhale through your nose and mouth together. Then put just
your nose and mouth in the water, and exhale through both your nose
and mouth, strongly, just as you did to make the ripples. Bubbles will
form, indicating that you are forming the air flow mentioned earlier.
You should be able to see, hear, and feel them. As soon as you run out of
air to exhale, life your nose and mouth out of the water and inhale
deeply. Do this ten more times without stopping.
Finally, put your whole face in the water. You can keep your eyes
open or closed for now. Repeat the inhale/exhale exercise ten times,
inhaling deeply and exhaling as strongly as you can.
EXTRA TIPS
To get rid of the excess water between dunkings, wipe your face with
your hand, sweeping the water from the top of your forehead down to
your chin. At this point, you might want to have a towel handy, just in
case, before you start the water breathing exercises.
During your breathing cycle, especially during exhalation, try to
release any tensions you may have and try to induce the feeling of total
relaxation. Let your muscles relax and go limp.
This basic inhale/exhale sequence is exactly what you will be doing in
the pool. That’s all there is to it. As you have seen, it’s fundamentally a
matter of breathing the way you normally do—you’re just taking more
conscious control and doing it more forcefully.
Flutter Kicking
There are several other beginning exercises you can do at home. One of
the most important is the flutter kick, which is the basic leg motion for
both the crawl stroke and the backstroke.
HOW TO DO IT
Sit on the edge of a chair or couch, letting your heels rest on the floor.

--- Page 38 Text ---
Stretch your legs straight out in front of you, parallel to the floor, toes
pointed downward, yet keeping your ankles relaxed and floppy. Lean
back and support yourself with your arms on the back of the chair or
couch. Now move your legs alternately up and down as though you were
a wooden soldier. Keep your legs straight but your ankles loose and
relaxed. The important thing is to kick with the entire leg, with the
power from the hip and thigh, keeping the knees relatively straight.
Repeat this twenty times, counting once for each leg change.
EXTRA TIPS
You may find this difficult to do, especially if you have not been
exercising regularly. If you experience a little muscle soreness in your
abdomen and upper legs following this exercise, the important thing is
to keep practicing, since this will actually help to alleviate any soreness
or tightness in the water. Flutter kick while you’re waiting for your hair
to dry, the butter to melt, the phone to ring. Do it while watching TV—
especially during the commercials, when you might be in the habit of
rushing to the kitchen for another bowl of potato chips!
Gradually work up from twenty kicks, building up to a set of one
hundred or more kicks, and repeat. You’ll be amazed at how soon your
condition will improve.
Remember: Keep your knees straight. Watch them. If they still bend,
wrap a ribbon or a piece of fabric, a towel or an Ace bandage around
each of them to help remind you to keep them straight.
BENEFITS
As with the breathing exercises, this is substantially what you’ll be doing
in the water. Practice on dry land familiarizes you with the kick and
starts strengthening the muscles you need to do it.
Flutter Kicking and Breathing
Once you’re satisfied with your progress doing the breathing and kicking

--- Page 39 Text ---
exercises separately, you’re ready to combine them. Of course, you were
breathing before while you were kicking—now it’s just a matter of
combining them consciously.
HOW TO DO IT
Sitting on the edge of a chair, flutter kick with your legs straight, as
before. Inhale and exhale strongly through your nose and mouth
together, as you did with your face in the water. Try to think only about
the kicking and the breathing. Don’t worry about how many kicks per
breath you’re taking. As long as both are continuous and together, you’re
doing fine. Do this for thirty seconds.
EXTRA TIPS
When combining the breathing and kicking skills, keep the legs straight
and breathe rhythmically.
BENEFITS
You will be combining these skills in the water, and the more you
practice on land, the easier the transition will be. You are also building
up your leg and abdominal muscles, as well as the breathing capacity
you’ll need once you start to swim.
Bobbing
The next skill is bobbing, which is similar to a knee bend.
HOW TO DO IT
Stand up and put both hands on a piece of furniture about waist high in
front of you. Bend at the knees ten times, keeping your upper body
straight. Then hold on, with your right hand only, to bob another five

--- Page 40 Text ---
times. Repeat five more times while holding on with only your left hand.
Finally, bob ten more times while not holding on at all.
EXTRA TIPS
Take care to keep your back straight and your weight distributed evenly
on both feet. Increase the depth of your bobs from a half to a full knee
bend (if your knees are sensitive, keep your bends shallow). Keep your
back straight, with shoulder blades back.
BENEFITS
This helps tone the quadriceps muscles in the front of the thigh, as well
as the gastronemous, or calf muscle. Later, you’ll be bobbing in the pool
to help acclimate your body to the water temperature, and to practice
your breathing. Depending upon your physical condition, it may also
begin to increase your cardiovascular efficiency.
Bobbing and Breathing
Now it’s time to combine bobbing and breathing.
HOW TO DO IT
Hold on to the same piece of furniture with both hands, as before. Inhale
deeply through both your nose and mouth as you’re standing tall. Exhale
strongly when you bend your knees. Repeat this ten times.
EXTRA TIPS
Go slowly so that you can concentrate on inhaling as you’re standing and
exhaling as you’re bending. If you have a partner, join hands and
alternate your inhaling (up) and exhaling (down), in a seesaw motion, so
that you can check each other.

--- Page 41 Text ---
W S
ATER KILLS
The time has come to put your newly acquired skills to practice in the
water. At this point, you may want to pick up a pair of goggles (see this
page) if your eyes are sensitive to chlorine, if you wear contact lenses, or
if you just want to see better. And this is a good time to remind you
never to go into the water unless there’s another person around, and to
stay in the shallow water until you’re sure of your ability to swim in
deeper water.
The Warm-up
It’s a good idea to warm up the muscles in your body before you get into
the water. These edge-of-the-pool or warm-up/prep skills help get your
muscles ready for the “real stuff” that follows.
BREATHING
Begin by sitting on the edge of the pool or deck, at the shallow end. Let
your feet dangle in the water. Start the breathing exercises you did at
home, using both the nose and mouth. Repeat this breathing cycle ten
times, putting a hand in front of your face to make sure you are exhaling
strongly enough.
FLUTTER KICKING
Breathing normally, do the same flutter kick you did while sitting on
your couch. Remember: knees straight, the power of the kick coming
from the hips and thighs, ankles loose and relaxed. Move your legs
alternately up and down. Kick at least twenty times, counting one for
each leg.

--- Page 42 Text ---
Flutter kicking on the pool deck.
FLUTTER KICKING AND BREATHING
Now combine the two, as you did at home, kicking alternately, and
inhaling and exhaling forcefully. Do this for about one minute.
Bobbing
To help you adjust to the water, splash some over your arms, shoulders,
face, and legs. First sit on the edge of the pool; then enter the water.
Place your right hand next to you on the deck and bring your left hand
around and place it next to the right, rotating your body around to the
right 180 degrees. Continue this half turn to the right while letting your
legs touch the pool bottom and your body slide smoothly into the water.
You should find yourself facing the side of the pool, with both hands still
holding on to the edge for safety. Of course, you could also turn to the
left, if you find that more comfortable.

--- Page 43 Text ---
Bobbing and breathing.
HOW TO DO IT
After you’ve entered the pool, immediately start bobbing up and down,
just as you did on land. Hold on to the edge of the pool with both hands
at first and bob up and down five times. Then hold on with just your left
hand and bob another five times. Switch hands and bob again, gradually
deepening your bends until your chin touches the water. If you’re
practicing these skills with a partner, face each other and join hands.
Then the two of you should bob up and down alternately, like a seesaw.
Do ten bobs, shaking right hands; then another ten with left hands
joined.

--- Page 44 Text ---
EXTRA TIPS
As you bend down, exhale deeply and be aware of how the water feels—
its buoyancy will help support you later. Relax and enjoy the water.
Even if you’re already a swimmer, this bobbing motion will help your
body adjust to the temperature change.
BENEFITS
Bobbing will continue to strengthen your quadriceps (thigh) and calf
muscles. As you bob, feel the slight resistance of the water; feel its
buoyancy and how much lighter you seem to be than on dry land. If you
noticed any feeling of discomfort doing this exercise on dry land, it will
disappear when you bob in the water: the extra support will be evident
in all the dry-land exercises you transfer to the water. You’ll soon learn
to love the delicious feeling of having water all around you.
Breathing
Let’s go back to the breathing. You’ll be doing the same thing you did in
your sink, bowl, or bathtub—but this time in the pool.
HOW TO DO IT
Return to the wall of the pool. Once more, review the breathing skills
you learned on dry land; inhale very slowly and deeply as if you were
yawning, then exhale forcefully, as if to cool off that cup of coffee. Try
to release the air fully each time. Repeat five breathing cycles. Next, put
your chin on the surface of the water, and inhale and exhale as you did
at home, forming ripples on the surface of the water. Repeat five more
cycles. Holding on to the edge of the pool, put your chin on the water.
Inhale and, as you exhale, tip your head a little so just your nose and
mouth go below the water’s surface. Remember, you should be forming
air bubbles just the way you did at home in your sink. Repeat five times,
putting your head down a little deeper into the water each time. Take a

--- Page 45 Text ---
break; then repeat five more times.
EXTRA TIPS
Try to inhale fully and deeply. While exhaling, allow your body to go
limp. Make sure you don’t cheat: put your whole face into the water, not
just the tip of your nose. If you have trouble anywhere along the way
(coughing or choking), stop and go back to an earlier part of the exercise
until it feels comfortable. Most people have to exhale out their noses
more forcefully than out their mouths because their nasal passages are
smaller. If you have a sinus condition, it may be even harder. But it’s
still important to exhale and create an air flow that keeps the water out.
BENEFITS
Feeling comfortable exhaling underwater is the first step in a successful
swimming program. Everything you’ve done thus far has been in
preparation for this skill. Swimming, remember, is an aerobic exercise,
so breathing—deeply, regularly, and comfortably—is basic. If you begin
to feel dizzy, you’re breathing too fast and too deeply (hyperventilating);
if you feel tired, you’re not breathing deeply enough (working
anaerobically).
Bobbing and Breathing
You’re ready to combine the two skills you’ve just practiced separately—
bobbing and breathing.
HOW TO DO IT
Hold on to the edge of the pool and, bending your knees, jump up and
down very slowly, putting your whole face underwater and exhaling
forcefully. Do this five times, very slowly. Next, as you bob, try opening
your eyes underwater. Open one eye just slightly at first, then the other,

--- Page 46 Text ---
then both. Repeat five more times.
If you’re working with a partner, join hands and bob in the same
seesaw motion as before. Begin bobbing with your eyes closed, then with
them open.
EXTRA TIPS
Don’t forget to inhale above water and exhale underwater to form
bubbles. Gradually open your eyes wider and wider. Try to feel, hear,
and see the bubbles each time.
BENEFITS
Bobbing will help you adjust to the water.
Flutter Kicking on the Wall
Now we’ll move on to another skill—kicking. Let’s get that water
churning! Work that body!
HOW TO DO IT
Supine (Face-up) Position: Stand with your back to the wall of the
pool. Bend your knees until the water reaches your shoulders. Reach
back with both hands over your shoulders and grasp the edge of the
pool. Keeping your elbows down and next to your side for leverage, lift
your legs up close to the surface of the water and do the same flutter
kick you did on land. Kick thirty times, counting once for each leg
motion. To return to a standing position, bend at the hips, as if you were
about to sit down in a chair. When your hips touch the wall, lower your
feet until they touch bottom, then let go with your hands.

--- Page 47 Text ---
Supine flutter kick.
Prone (Face-down) Position: Turn around and face the wall of the
pool. Hold on to the edge with one hand. Press the other against the
wall, under the surface of the water, with your fingers facing down (this
is the “bracket position”). Pull with the top arm and push with the
bottom, keeping both arms straight for leverage, and lift your legs up
behind you as close to the surface of the water as possible. Now do the
same flutter kick you did before—legs straight, moving up and down
alternately thirty times. Once that feels comfortable, add your breathing.
Inhale deeply, then put your face into the water and exhale strongly.
Lowering your head into the water will allow you to bring your legs up
just below the water surface—this is just the beginning of good
swimming form.
Prone flutter kick in the bracket position.
EXTRA TIPS
Make sure you stay relaxed and that your legs are straight but not stiff.

Watch out for “bicycle riding” (i.e., bending your knees too much). Try
to relax your ankles, too—it’s the same flexing action as when you’re
walking. The trick here is to make the water bubble as though it were
boiling. If your feet make a significant splash, you’re overkicking.
Kick from the hip and thigh. If your legs seem to sink, you are
probably “piking”—bending at the hips. Try arching your back—your
legs will automatically move closer to the surface.
As you’re kicking, keep Newton’s third law of motion in mind: for
every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. In other words, for
you to move forward, you have to move water backward. If you kick with
your legs up too high, you’re moving mostly air, not water. It may look
impressive, but it’s actually a waste of energy and won’t take you very
far. On the other hand, if you kick with your legs too low in the water,
you’re propelling your body vertically, not horizontally. As a result, you
don’t move efficiently through the water that way, either.
You may have to experiment a bit to find the most comfortable way of
holding on to the pool edge. If may be a little rough on your arms and
hands at first, until you build up their strength. Always shake them out
when you’re through practicing. For supine kicking, you might try
stretching your arms along the wall, with your head resting on it. If
possible, use the corner of the pool for this. Try as many ways as
circumstances allow, until you find the one that’s comfortable for you.
BENEFITS
This will help to increase your range of motion in the hips, to slim and
tone your thighs, and to build up strength in your legs. Prone kicking
will also help you become more comfortable with your face submerged.
Even accomplished swimmers isolate kicking as part of their workouts to
improve their form and build up that part of their bodies.
Cool-down
This part of the lesson reinforces the skills you’ve already learned and
allows the body to make the gradual transition from strenuous activity
back to lighter activity, and from being wet to being dry. Review the

--- Page 49 Text ---
skills you’ve just learned, concentrating a bit more on those you feel
unsure about. Breathe and bob, and flutter kick in both prone and supine
positions. If you have a partner, practice together, watching carefully so
you can correct and help each other.
To get out of the pool, use this push-up exit. Put both hands on the
deck of the pool, and bob up and down three times. As you rise up on
the fourth bob, straighten your arms and start flutter kicking at the same
time. Lift and swirl your body up onto the edge of the pool, so that you
end up in a sitting position facing the water. Besides helping to
strengthen your arms and shoulders, this exit will come in handy when
you’re not near the pool steps or ladder.
Homework
Try to practice the dry-land exercises every day. Do the breathing
exercises for five minutes, first without water, then with a sink or tub
full of water. Every morning, maybe after a light breakfast, sit on a chair
and practice flutter kicking. Then stand up and bob up and down in
place.
If you had any problem with a particular skill, concentrate on that
one, paying close attention to any extra tips that have been suggested.
Try to practice with your partner—if you have one—on dry land as well
as in the water. Observe each other closely so you can critique each
other for further improvement. Remember, when your partner does
something particularly well, tell him or her; a little deserved praise goes
a long way.
If you want, start a personal homework log. It’s a great way to watch
how much better and stronger you’re getting with every practice session.
Spend as much time as possible now learning the beginning skills. It
may not look much like swimming, but it does form the basis for what
you’ll be learning later on. When you feel really comfortable doing
everything you’ve learned in Lesson One, turn the page to begin Lesson
Two.

ESSON 2
I
n this lesson you’ll begin to gain even more control over your
breathing, by learning to exhale very slowly. You’ll also learn the prone
float and recovery and you’ll use the prone flutter kick to really get you
moving through the water.
I’ve also suggested some Swimmers’ Shape-up exercises to condition
your body and help you warm up. These will go a long way toward
improving your swimming skills and raising your fitness level, and so
make learning easier and faster. I’ll be adding a few more in later
lessons.
Dry-Land/Prep Skills
Do these general body-conditioning exercises at home, just before you
begin reviewing old skills and learning new ones. Since you’ll be moving
around more than in Lesson One, it’s advisable to wear loose and
comfortable clothing during this and subsequent lessons.
Swimmers’ Shape-up Exercises
Depending upon your physical condition, you may need to work your
body harder than you’ve been doing. If you’ve been getting regular
exercise, you’re probably in fairly good shape. Even so, that’s no excuse
to avoid these. Since they work the parts of the body needed for
swimming, you can do them as a change from, or in addition to, your
regular activity. For those who have been inactive, these exercises are
doubly important. Some are similar to the warm-up skills and general
swimming movements; they’ll also help you to release tension and so

--- Page 51 Text ---
free your body for action. (See “Swimmers’ Shape-ups,” this page). Feel
free to incorporate as many as you like into your lessons.
These exercises will improve your overall fitness by increasing your
cardiovascular capacity, your strength, and your flexibility. If done
before the rest of your lesson, the exercises will relax and energize you
at the same time, giving you a positive up-’n’-at-’em attitude that will
make practicing and learning easier.
EXTRA TIPS
Practice these exercises any time, maybe as part of your morning routine
—they’re a great waker-upper! Do them all, or just a few if that’s all you
have time for. The more you do them, the easier they’ll become. Add
some of your own if you have any favorites, or if you feel that you need
to work one area more than others. Exercising to music makes things
more fun, as will doing them with a partner.
Review Skills
At home, review and practice the dry-land skills that you learned in
Lesson One, particularly the breathing, flutter kicking, and bobbing
exercises.
Controlled Breathing
Now you’re just going to do a slower exhalation than you’ve practiced in
the first lesson. For this, it’s a good idea to have a watch or clock with a
second hand. If one isn’t available, count off the seconds by saying to
yourself “one Mississippi, two Mississippi, three Mississippi,” and so on.
HOW TO DO IT
Sitting up straight, inhale with both nose and mouth; then exhale. Do it
at the same rhythm and with the same force you’ve been using to

--- Page 52 Text ---
practice, but make a note of how many seconds it takes for you to
exhale. Next inhale again, but this time take a full five seconds to exhale
forcefully. If you can’t, keep trying, adding a second or two each time.
Most people will find they have some air left after five seconds. If so,
lengthen your time to ten seconds, then fifteen. Now do the same thing
with your face submerged in a sink or tub full of water.
EXTRA TIPS
If you have a partner, keep track of the time for each other. If you want
to add a little competition to spur you along, both of you exhale at the
same time and see who can hold out longer.
From now on, whenever you practice breathing, consciously try to
lengthen your exhalation time.
BENEFITS
This exercise helps to increase your lung capacity and it shows you that
you don’t have to breathe as often as you thought and that your lungs
can take in more air than you suspected. Later on, slow down your
breathing. It will help you get a “second wind.” It’ll also help to relax
you, since this type of regular, slow, deep breathing is a lot like yogic
breathing.
Prone Float and Recovery to a Stand
The next step in learning the crawl stroke is really a safety measure.
Before you learn how to float on your stomach, you should be able to
return from the prone position to a standing one.
HOW TO DO IT
To practice this motion on land, stand with feet together and arms
stretched out straight in front of you at shoulder level. Bend your knees

--- Page 53 Text ---
as if you were doing a bob and at the same time press your arms down
in front of you and to the sides. Tilt your face upward as you straighten
your knees to a standing position. Repeat ten times.
EXTRA TIPS
As you practice this skill, repeat these key words with each motion:
“Bend, press, lift, and stand.” To grasp the movement better, imagine
sitting down at a table and then standing up again by pressing down on
the table top.
If you’re practicing with a buddy, you can help your partner to recover
by placing your hands, thumbs facing upward, at his or her armpits to
gently support and lift the partner to a standing position.
BENEFITS
This is the first step toward independent swimming, since it’s basic to
your safety. If you’re not practicing with a partner or using a wall (or
lifeline or kickboard) for support, this gives you an efficient, safe way to
recover to a standing position.
Prone Glide and Flutter Kicking with Assistance
This is the next step in learning the crawl stroke. Since this is the “dry
run,” you’ll be walking instead of flutter kicking. If you don’t have a
partner, your “assistance” at this point will be a wall, or the edge of a
table or counter top. Those with partners will assist each other now, as
well as later on when you transfer this skill to the pool.
HOW TO DO IT
Without a Partner: Stretch your arms out straight, palms down. Stand
beside a table or a wall and run one hand along it as a guide (this is your
“partner”). Take five steps forward with your chin tucked to your chest

--- Page 54 Text ---
and with your free arm covering your ear. As you do, exhale through
both nose and mouth. Then turn around and, using your other hand to
guide you, walk another five steps in the other direction so you end up
where you started. Repeat.
With a Partner: Stand facing each other and grasp each other’s
elbows, keeping the arms straight. Have your partner place his or her
hands palms up, and place your hands palms down over your partner’s.
Then have your partner walk backward five steps and, like an
“engineer,” guide you, the “train,” as you take five steps forward. Next,
change positions so that you support your partner’s arms while he or she
becomes the train. Repeat twice, remembering to let your head drop
down and to exhale through your nose and mouth as you walk forward.
EXTRA TIPS
Make sure your arms stay absolutely straight. Get in the habit now, and
you won’t have to worry about your form later. Swimmers with partners
can check each other. Others can check themselves periodically, with a
mirror. This reminder goes for everybody: keep your chin tucked to your
chest, with your arms covering your ears, when practicing this skill.
W S
ATER KILLS
For this lesson, you’ll need a kickboard or other flotation support. Ask
the swimming pool personnel what they have that you can use.
By this time, you should be noticing a definite difference while you’re
in the water—a new ease, new confidence, new strength. You’ll find
yourself feeling more relaxed and enjoying the water perhaps as you
never had before.
Warm-up
As you know by now, it’s important to warm up before you enter the

--- Page 55 Text ---
water, which is always a lower temperature than your body. From now
on, you have a choice: you may either start with the regular pool-side
warm-up, which is a review of the skills you’ve learned so far, or treat
yourself to a super warm-up and conditioning by prefacing your
swimming with some of the exercises you learned as part of the dry-
land/prep skills for that lesson. Or, if some form of exercise is already
part of your life, why not schedule your activity for just before you
practice your water skills? You’ll be nicely warmed up, and nothing feels
better after exercising than a refreshing swim. Do whatever you prefer,
and whatever circumstances allow. Just remember pool rules, common
courtesy, and safety.
Whether you add extra exercises or not, everyone should do the
regular pool-side warm-up from Lesson One.
Controlled Breathing
Now you’re ready to practice your breathing in the pool.
HOW TO DO IT
Hold on to the edge of the pool, or join hands with your partner and
take turns practicing this skill. Take three deep breaths. Then take one
more deep breath through both your nose and your mouth; put your face
in the water and exhale for as long as you can, again through both nose
and mouth. This may take you anywhere from five seconds up to a
whole minute—everyone has a different capacity. But everyone can
increase whatever capacity he has, so practice this several times, each
time trying to add a few more seconds to your previous exhalation, until
you feel you’ve reached your limit for today. Partners can time each
other; or you can count slowly to yourself or refer to a waterproof watch
or the pool clock.
EXTRA TIPS
Remember, you’re not trying to hold your breath. Your goal is to form a

--- Page 56 Text ---
slow, controlled, steady stream of bubbles from your mouth and nose.
Simply holding your breath is easier at first, but it doesn’t form an air
flow and is a guaranteed way of getting water up your nose.
BENEFITS
This exercise helps to increase your lung capacity while training you to
utilize what you already have more fully. The more you practice, the
longer you’ll be able to exhale without coming up for another breath.
Later on, you’ll find that the less often you have to turn your face up for
air, the more efficient your swimming strokes will be.
If you’ve been uncomfortable in the water until now, this slow, steady
breathing will probably help you relax as well.
Prone Flutter Kicking with Controlled Breathing
Now that you’re warmed up and have reviewed the skills you’ve already
learned, let’s go on to the next step, which combines flutter kicking with
the controlled breathing technique.
HOW TO DO IT
Begin by holding on to the edge of the pool in your usual prone position.
Start to flutter kick, then take a deep breath. Put your face down in the
water, exhaling as slowly as possible, and counting (or using a watch) as
you do so. Come up for air whenever you need to. Repeat as many times
as you comfortably can, extending your exhalation by a few seconds
each time.
EXTRA TIPS
Your prone flutter kicking should be pretty good by now—toes pointed,
ankles relaxed and fluid, power coming from the hip and thigh, not the
knee. Don’t let your form fall apart because you’re concentrating on your

--- Page 57 Text ---
breathing. Just make the water “boil.” Don’t overkick or come too close
to the surface, either. Partners should check and correct each other for
this common mistake.
BENEFITS
In combining these two skills, you’re coordinating what you already
know. Eventually, you’ll be using these skills in the crawl stroke.
Prone Float and Recovery to a Stand
HOW TO DO IT
Without a Partner: First practice the recovery only. Begin by standing in
chest-deep water with one side facing the wall. Hold on to the wall with
the nearer hand and extend the other arm forward in the water. Bend
your knees, press your free arm down, lift your head up and stand. Do
this five times. Next, crouch down to shoulder level. Inhale, drop your
face into the water, and exhale as you push off the wall or the bottom.
Let your legs come up to the surface of the water and keep your free
hand straight in front of you. As you glide through the water, slide your
other hand along the wall of the pool. When you need to come up for
air, recover to a stand. Practice this ten times (five times on each side),
until you are comfortable doing it.
Prone float.

--- Page 58 Text ---
Recovery to a stand from the prone position.
Then move a step or two away from the wall and repeat the
procedure: practice the recovery first with both arms; then crouch down,
head in the water, and push off. Make sure your arms are straight out in
front of you in a streamlined position. When you run out of air, recover
to a stand. Practice this ten times.
With a Partner: Assist each other while practicing the recovery to a
stand. Stand facing each other, an arm’s length apart. One partner (the
floater) places his or her face in the water, sets one foot in front of the
other and pushes off the bottom of the pool, allowing the feet to rise
toward the surface. The legs should be straight, the back arched slightly,
and the arms extended straight forward. The helper places his or her
hands, thumbs facing upward, under the armpits of the floater. As the
floater bends and then straightens the knees to stand, the helper
supports and lifts the partner. Then assume the train-and-engineer
position with just the hands touching. As one partner does the float, let
go with your hands during the recovery, but be prepared to assist if your
buddy needs it. Practice the rest of the procedure according to “Without

--- Page 59 Text ---
a Partner,” above.
EXTRA TIPS
You’ll see how the water’s resistance helps you to make a smooth
transition from a horizontal floating position to a vertical standing
position. Remember, to coordinate the movements, repeat to yourself:
“Bend, press, lift, and stand.” If you feel that you’re ready, add a slight
flutter kick to the float to help you move along. Then let go with one
hand and recover to a stand. Keep practicing, alternating hands, and
letting go for a gradually longer length of time before you recover. You
can also practice the recovery with your back against the wall: push
your hands back flat against the wall as your knees bend and your head
lifts.
Partners should try this without assistance at first, but with the other
watching, and being there to help, if necessary, during the recovery. This
method is better than grasping each other by the arms or hands, which
immobilizes the floater and prevents him from helping himself.
BENEFITS
This is the first step on the road to “swimmer’s lib”-once you know how
to resume a vertical position safely, you can throw away your kickboard
and swim on your own with more confidence. By working on the
recovery to a stand, you’re also improving your coordination—getting
your arms, legs, and head to do what you want them to do, when you
want them to do it.
Prone Glide and Flutter Kicking with Assistance
You’ve practiced flutter kicking enough. Now it’s time to use that power
to propel your body through the water.
HOW TO DO IT

--- Page 60 Text ---
Without a Partner: Stand in the corner of the pool, with one wall at
your back and the other to your side. Bend your leg and place your foot
flat against the wall in back of you; bend down so the water is shoulder
level. This is the push-off position. Place the hand that’s nearer the side
wall on the edge of the deck or gutter—that’s what you’ll be using as a
guide and support instead of the table edge or wall that you used at
home. Place the other hand straight out in front of you, palm down, on
the surface of the water. Now straighten your leg and push off so your
body glides into the prone position. Immediately begin to flutter kick,
letting your hand slide along the top of the wall. When you get to the
other side of the shallow end, turn around and repeat in the opposite
direction. Flutter kick across the pool at least five times.
With a Partner: Assume the train-and-engineer position you practiced
on dry land. The “engineer” will hold his or her arms straight, with
palms up, at water level, and the “train” will hold his or her arms
straight, palms down, on top of the engineer’s. Whoever is the train
begins in the push-off position described above, but away from the
corner, since you won’t be needing the support of the side wall. As you
push off, start to flutter kick. Your engineer walks backward, guiding
you, as he did on land. Each time you repeat this skill, let your grip inch
closer to each other’s hands until only your fingertips are touching. Then
switch positions and repeat, until each swimmer has flutter kicked across
the width of the pool at least five times.

--- Page 61 Text ---
Push-off into a prone float without a partner.
Train-and-engineer support position.

--- Page 62 Text ---
EXTRA TIPS
This is the same skill you practiced on land, except now you’re flutter
kicking instead of walking. Remember, it’s actually easier in water, since
your body feels as though it weighs less than it does on land.
After the first five times, try putting your head in the water and
exhaling as you kick. Don’t try to control the length of your exhalation
for now unless you feel ready. Just exhale as usual, and recover to a
stand whenever you need to come up for air. Then exhale again as you
resume kicking.
Remember your form. Just because you’re adding something new to a
skill you’ve already learned doesn’t mean you should get sloppy. Keep
your legs just as straight, your feet just as pointed, your ankles just as
relaxed as when you’re holding on to the edge of the pool. And keep
your arms straight—don’t collapse at the elbow.
BENEFITS
You may not realize it, but once you’ve mastered this step, you’re
combining three skills needed for swimming the crawl stroke—flutter
kicking, exhaling underwater, and keeping your arms straight. This is
the correct, streamlined body position that makes kicking so much easier
and more efficient. The push-off will also give you a glimpse of how
exciting moving your whole body through the water can be.
Prone Glide and Flutter Kick with Kickboard (Optional)
It’s time you got around to using a kickboard to help support yourself.
(This step is optional, since some pools don’t allow flotation devices, or
just might not have a board available.)
HOW TO DO IT
Without a Partner: Stand near a wall, in the push-off position. Hold the
kickboard with both hands, halfway up its sides, with the rounded end

--- Page 63 Text ---
facing away from you. Make sure your arms are perfectly straight ahead
of you, then crouch down so that the water is at shoulder level. Inhale,
and push off as you lower your head into the water and flutter kick your
way across the width of the pool. Remember, make those bubbles
underwater, and come up for air (by turning or lifting your head or by
recovering to a stand) only when you have to. Now you’ll appreciate
how important it is to keep your eyes open underwater so you can see
where you’re headed. As you kick, stay close to the side of the wall
along the shallow end.
When you get to the other side, turn around and flutter kick back the
other way. Repeat at least five times.
With a Partner: If you want, you can take this intermediate step to
make the transition to using the kickboard more gradual. Flutter kick
using the kickboard as I describe above, but have your partner hold on
to the sides near the rounded tip of the board to give you additional
support. Flutter kick across the width of the pool, five times each. Then
each partner should repeat the exercise alone, using only the kickboard
for support.
EXTRA TIPS
Keep thinking about stretching your arms and legs to keep them straight
and streamlined. Make sure you keep the good form you’ve learned, and
kick from the hip. Be certain your arms cover your ears; partners should
check each other on this.
BENEFITS
This exercise will further improve your form by helping you to keep
your body straight and moving smoothly through the water. It will also
help to give you confidence in the water’s buoyancy, and in your
increasing ability to swim.

--- Page 64 Text ---
Cool-down
Review all the skills you’ve learned, especially the new ones: controlled
breathing and flutter kicking across the pool. End with a few bobs and
maybe some of the gentler conditioning exercises you’ve been doing on
dry land. Everything is easier and more relaxing when you do it in
water. And remember to use your push-up exit from the pool.
Homework
Continue to practice your controlled breathing, gradually extending the
exhalation. When you practice in a tub of water, get used to opening
your eyes and taking a good look at those bubbles that are keeping the
water out of your nasal passages. Also, practice flutter kicking to
continue to build your strength and technique. Every once in a while,
stand in front of a mirror, raise your arms straight above your head, with
thumbs locked, and carefully check your form and get accustomed to
how it feels to be in this position—it’s so easy to forget and bend at the
elbows when you’re in the water, without even realizing it. Continue to
update your homework log, particularly concerning your controlled
breathing. Do the conditioning exercises as often as possible, or
substitute some of your own. For instance, you might prefer bike riding
or a good brisk walk. Add to your dry-land activity whenever you can.
Walk, bicycle, or roller skate instead of driving or taking a bus. Jog
when you walk the dog. Do a few exercises on your lunch break—they’re
great tension relievers as well as conditioners. And don’t forget to work
on your water skills whenever you can, even if your partner isn’t
available. You’ll find that a few minutes here, a few minutes there, will
really add up and speed you on your way to fun, fitness, and health.

L
ESSON 3
T
his is the lesson where the pieces of the puzzle really come together—
controlled rhythmic breathing, flutter kicking, and the crawl arm
motion. At the end of this lesson you’ll be doing the crawl stroke—some
for the first time, some for the first time correctly, and everyone with a
real understanding of the components and mechanics of the stroke.
If at any time you feel you are having too much trouble mastering the
crawl stroke, or if you just feel more comfortable on your back, skip to
Lesson Six, where you’ll find the beginning of the backstroke. (I know I
said not to skip around, but there are exceptions to every rule.) The
important thing is not to let some hang-up about putting your face in the
water, or a problem with your rhythmic breathing, stop your progress.
Meanwhile, keep practicing the beginning skills you learned earlier until
you feel comfortable enough in the prone position, then go back to the
crawl stroke.
Since you’re going to begin really moving through the water in this
lesson, you might want to put on a bathing cap (if you haven’t done so
already) to keep your hair protected and out of your eyes. You may also
want to get goggles (see this page), if you’ve been experiencing some
discomfort from swimming-pool chemicals.
D -L /P S
RY AND REP KILLS
If you have the time, the energy, and the inclination (and I hope you
do), begin this lesson with the conditioning exercises you learned in
Lesson Two.
Review Skills

--- Page 66 Text ---
First review these dry-land/prep skills from Lessons One and Two:
breathing, flutter kicking, bobbing, and prone flutter kicking with
assistance.
Crawl Stroke (Hand-over-hand Arm Motion)
This is the familiar hand-over-hand motion that is the basis of the crawl
stroke. It’s simple, really, but many people have learned it incorrectly, or
have simply gotten a bit sloppy over the years.
Actually there are two stages in learning the crawl stroke. The first
isn’t considered the most efficient by today’s standards, but it’s easier for
novice swimmers because it’s a simpler, more direct motion. After
you’ve mastered this first stage, we’ll move on to the second, which
makes for a more efficient and powerful stroke.
HOW TO DO IT
To begin, put your left hand on your left hip for now so that you can
concentrate on your right arm. Extend your right arm straight out in
front of you, fingers together and pointed downward. Then pull your
right arm straight down, until your thumb brushes the outside of your
right thigh. With your arm still straight, bring it back as far as it will go.
Then bring it back even further. When you’ve really reached your limit,
bend your elbow, recovering it up as high as it will go—as if you were a
puppet and someone were pulling on your elbow with a string. Keep
lifting the elbow as high as it will go as you bring the arm forward, then
straighten it when it comes back to the starting, or catch, position.
Repeat with the right arm five more times; then shake out your arms and
practice the motion with your left arm, keeping your right hand resting
on your right hip so that you can isolate the movement.
When you’ve got that, it’s time to try the catch-up stroke, where you
move both arms alternately, making sure that your thumb touches (or
“catches up” to) the other before you begin the next downward
movement. Begin in the prone position, arms straight out, thumbs
touching. Do the crawl stroke with your right arm: press your hand
straight down and back (the pull), bend the elbow high up toward the

--- Page 67 Text ---
ceiling and bring the arm forward (the recovery), then touch thumbs
with the left hand (the catch), and immediately repeat with the left arm
to complete the stroke cycle. A cycle is when the right and left arm each
pull once. Repeat the cycle ten times.
Next, repeat this procedure, but walk forward simultaneously to
simulate the flutter kicking you’ll be adding later. Make sure, as you’re
walking, that you lower your head and look in front of you.
The pull.

--- Page 68 Text ---
The recovery.
EXTRA TIPS
This will be much easier in the water, I guarantee you. On land, your
arms may feel heavy and get tired; but in the pool you’ll feel lighter and
more graceful because of the water’s buoyancy. You’ll definitely feel
your shoulders and arms working—that’s why those conditioning
exercises are so important. Make sure you consciously relax your neck
and shoulders. To get the flow of the movement, go very slowly, as if
you were in a slow-motion film, and repeat the key words as you
practice: “Pull, bend, recover, and catch.”
BENEFITS

--- Page 69 Text ---
The crawl stroke takes a lot of coordination; by practicing the motion on
land, you’ll find it that much easier in the water. Also, by actually
moving your arms and stretching your shoulders on land, you’re
increasing your range of motion.
W S
ATER KILLS
Warm-up
As usual, the warm-up consists of conditioning exercises, plus a review
of the skills you’ve learned thus far.
Review Skills
Practice your controlled breathing, flutter kicking, bobbing, prone glide
and flutter kicking with assistance, and/or with a kickboard.
Prone Glide to Wall with Flutter Kicking (Unassisted)
Now that you’ve seen how easy it is to flutter kick your way through the
water and to recover to a standing position, it’s time to let go of the
kickboard.
HOW TO DO IT
Step back about ten feet from the wall of the pool. To begin the prone
glide, walk toward the wall with your arms stretched out in front of you.
Then lower your face into the water, and continue walking forward,
exhaling those bubbles. Return to your starting position and take a step
forward—one leg in front of the other, knees bent, ready for push-off.
Then push off the bottom, letting your legs slowly float up to the surface
and continuing to move toward the wall without kicking. This results in
a beautiful, peaceful glide as the push-off propels your body smoothly

--- Page 70 Text ---
through the water.
Try this a few times without kicking, then give in to the natural
tendency to kick. Stop, and recover to a stand if you need to come up for
air; but try to reach the pool wall before you need air.
Keep practicing, moving a little farther back from the wall each time
so that you glide more.
EXTRA TIPS
Aim for a graceful, continuous movement. Give an energetic push-off,
starting with knees bent and shoulders at water level. Glide until you
begin to lose momentum, then begin to flutter kick. Remember your
form (partners check each other): arms stretched out straight, covering
your ears, body fully extended and streamlined. If your legs are sinking,
it’s probably because you’re piking (bending at the waist) in the water.
Push your hips forward, arch your back slightly, and stretch your legs.
Think of yourself as a torpedo gliding through the water.
Crawl-stroke Arm Motion (Assisted)
HOW TO DO IT
Crouch down in chest-deep water and bend forward slightly, with your
arms straight out in front of you, thumbs touching. Just as you did on
dry land, get the feel of the stroke by working one arm at a time at first
and resting the nonworking hand on your hip. Bring the arm straight
down, brush your outer thigh, and continue to stretch the arm straight
back as far as it will go. Then bend the elbow and carry it high as you
bring the arm forward. Straighten the arm and return to the starting
position. Next, work each arm alternately, repeating to yourself, “Pull,
recover, catch.” Repeat each complete stroke cycle at least ten times.
Now, still crouching, begin walking as you stroke, so that you get the
feel of your body moving through the water. Inhale, put your face into
the water as you exhale, and begin the arm stroke. Feel how pushing the
water back with your arms moves your body forward. (This is Newton’s

--- Page 71 Text ---
third law of motion in action.) Begin walking at just the speed that you
push the water. Repeat the crawl-stroke arm motion ten times, trying to
travel further each time before you run out of air. Now you’re ready to
take your feet off the ground.
Without a Partner: Crouch down so that the surface of the water is at
shoulder level. Inhale, place your face into the water to hairline level,
exhale, and push off with one arm straight in front of you. Begin the
crawl-stroke arm motion with that arm, letting your other hand slide
along the pool wall as you move through the water. Turn around and
practice in the other direction, working the opposite arm. Practice at
least ten times on each side. As the arm motion becomes more
comfortable, alternately release and grip the wall, gradually increasing
the length of each release.
With a Partner: Assume the train-and-engineer position. One partner
does the prone glide, adding the crawl-stroke arm motion. As the
swimmer begins the stroke, he or she lets go of the “engineer’s” hand
with that hand, but still holds on with the nonworking hand. As the
swimmer completes the stroke, he or she replaces the hand on the
partner’s arm, and slips off the opposite hand to continue the stroke.
Important: one hand must be in contact with the “engineer” at all times
—stay with your partner. The partners alternate until both have done at
least ten cycles.
EXTRA TIPS
Now that you’ve practiced it in the water, you’re ready to learn some of
the finer points of the stroker’s mechanics. Your hands should enter the
water at a 30-to 45-degree downward angle, and pull down and back
through the water in a 90-degree arc before you begin the recovery. If
you find it natural to add the flutter kick at this point, go ahead. If you
find that too much to do for right now, hold off. A lot depends on your
buoyancy: if you find that your legs are sinking, a smaller flutter kick
can help make the difference. So can your form—remember, stretch out

--- Page 72 Text ---
straight and press your hips forward in the prone position.
BENEFITS
You’re isolating the crawl-stroke arm motion without adding the
flutter kick right now so that you can concentrate on your form. That’s
also the reason that you’re doing the catch-up stroke. It may feel a little
awkward now, and you may complain that it slows you down in the
water. Exactly! That’s what you want to do right now—the slower you
move, the more time you have to think about and to feel what you’re
doing.
Crawl Stroke (Unassisted)
HOW TO DO IT
Step back about three body lengths from the wall. You will begin exactly
as for a prone glide, but instead of keeping your arms outstretched in
front of you at shoulder level, you’ll do the crawl stroke. Crouch down
so that the water is at shoulder level, inhale, put your face in the water,
exhale, and push off toward the wall. Immediately begin doing the crawl
stroke, alternating arms and remembering to pull down and back, bend
the elbow and lift it high, bring the arm forward, straighten it and touch
your other hand as your arm enters the water at a 30-to 45-degree angle.
Practice just the arm stroke a few times until you’re sure you have it,
then combine it with a little flutter kicking.
EXTRA TIPS
Don’t forget about your form, which will make swimming much easier
and more enjoyable. If you find yourself tensing up and crumpling into
an ineffective, splashing fetal position, try to relax. Straighten out.
Streamlining is the key; think about natural swimmers—fish, eels, and so
on—and elongate your body.

--- Page 73 Text ---
Cool-down
Review all your water skills, especially the new ones you’ve learned in
this lesson: the prone float and recovery (assisted and unassisted), the
crawl stroke (walking with assistance, and without it if you’re up to it).
End with some flutter kicking, using the kickboard or holding on to
the wall of the pool, and a few bobs with controlled breathing. Don’t
forget the push-up exit.
Homework
You have a lot to practice this time. Review the recovery to a stand in
front of the mirror or have your partner check your position. Work on
your crawl stroke standing in front of a mirror every day. Continue to
practice your bobbing and flutter kicking on land to develop your
strength, and do some shape-ups or your favorite activity as often as
possible to improve your overall fitness. Practice controlled breathing
whenever you think of it—at home watching TV, washing your face, or
even in an elevator. Add this and your new skills to your Homework
Log.

his is the breakthrough lesson for new swimmers. You’re now ready to
take the final step in learning the crawl stroke: coordinating your
controlled breathing with your arm and leg motions. First you’ll learn a
new skill: how to make your breathing regular and rhythmic. Then you’ll
combine the various components of the crawl stroke first in pairs: the
arm motion with the flutter kick; then the arm motion and rhythmic
breathing; then the flutter kick with rhythmic breathing. Finally, you’ll
put it all together, and you’ll have the total picture: the arm motion with
flutter kicking and rhythmic breathing.
When you’re through with this lesson, you’ll be a real swimmer who
does the crawl stroke correctly. That’s something to be proud of. How
about buying yourself a new bathing suit as a reward? You deserve it.
D -L /P S
RY AND REP KILLS
First do some conditioning exercises. As you do them, notice how your
endurance has improved since you first started. Since you’ll be needing
more and more strength and flexibility in the arms and shoulders as you
do the crawl, concentrate on exercises that work those areas. (See
“Swimmers’ Shape-ups.” this page.)
Review Skills
Run through the skills you’ve learned so far, paying particular attention
to the crawl arm motion.

The Law of Opposites (Crawl-stroke arm motion and rhythmic breathing).
Crawl-stroke Arm Motion and Rhythmic Breathing
At long last, here’s the ultimate piece to the crawl-stroke puzzle—a
method of coordinating your rhythmic breathing with your arm
movements. To illustrate this coordination, I’ve coined “The Law of
Opposites,” which I’ll explain below.
HOW TO DO IT
Begin by sitting up straight. Turn your head to the right, then return it to
forward; turn your head to the left, then forward again. Keep your head
level as you move it; don’t tilt it up or down, but only from side to side.
Imagine that you’re watching a tennis match, and your gaze is following
the ball back and forth. Repeat ten times for each side.
Next, add your rhythmic breathing: inhale deeply as you turn your
head to the side, then exhale forcefully as you face forward. Repeat
another ten times for each side. Exhale continuously as you rotate your
head back to the face-front position.

--- Page 76 Text ---
Now do this exercise, turning your head to only one side, then forward
again. Then repeat on the other side a few times. Remember, inhale as
you turn, exhale as you return. One side will probably feel more natural
to you. For most right-handed people, the right side will feel better; for
left-handed swimmers, it’s usually the left. But there are exceptions—
maybe both feel comfortable to you; maybe both feel awkward.
Whatever the case, pick one side for now—you can always change it
later. For simplicity’s sake, I’ll assume that you’re breathing on the right
side—if not, just read “left” wherever I say “right.”
Do this exercise one more time, but imagine that you’re in the water.
Lean forward from the waist and visualize your left cheek resting on the
water’s surface with your head turned to the right. It may help if you
rest your hands on your hips or thighs. Inhale, then, as you turn your
head down, exhale. Repeat ten times, turning your head only to the right
to inhale.
Next, add the arm motion. Here’s where “The Law of Opposites”
begins to operate: as you turn your head to one side to inhale, the arm
on the opposite side of your body is stretched out in front of you; the
arm on your breathing side is stretched behind you, out of the way. This
way, you’re assured of getting a “bite” of air—and not of your arm. Once
that’s clear in your mind, try to put it into practice. Sit or stand, leaning
forward, arms straight ahead, thumbs touching. Put your face down as if
it were in the water, and exhale. As your right arm pulls down and back,
turn your head to the right and inhale. As you bring your arm back to
the starting position, touch thumbs, and exhale as your left arm pulls
down and back.
Return your left arm to the starting position, and begin the cycle all
over again. Repeat ten times; rest, then repeat another ten times.
If you have a buddy, the next step is to go back to your train-and-
engineer position and practice the crawl-stroke arm motion with the
rythmic breathing you’ve just learned.
EXTRA TIPS
Make sure that you’re pivoting your head; don’t lift it at all to come up
for air. And turn your head to only one side. Whether it’s the right or left

--- Page 77 Text ---
doesn’t matter as long as you’re comfortable, and you stick to the same
side each time you inhale. Remember, it’s “Turn and inhale, return and
exhale.” If your neck feels a little stiff, don’t worry. It will loosen up in
time. Also remember to inhale and exhale continuously; try not to hold
your breath even for a moment.
W S
ATER KILLS
Warm-up
Do the conditioning exercises you’ve been doing, concentrating
particularly on stretching and strengthening the arms and shoulders in
preparation for doing the crawl stroke, and head circles to loosen up
your neck for rhythmic breathing. Then go right into a review of the
skills you’ve learned so far.
Review Skills
Practice your bobbing, controlled breathing, flutter kicking, prone float
and recovery to a stand, prone glide to wall with flutter kick, and crawl-
stroke arm motion.
Crawl-stroke Arm Motion and Flutter Kicking
Some of you may be doing this naturally already: for others, it will be a
new exciting step, even though it’s only combining the last two skills.
HOW TO DO IT
To begin, bend down so that the surface of the water is at your shoulder
level. Place your arms out straight in front of you, thumbs touching.
Inhale deeply and begin to walk forward, putting your face in the water
as you exhale. Start the crawl-stroke arm motion as you push off and

--- Page 78 Text ---
begin to flutter kick. Recover to a stand when you need more air; then
immediately repeat until you’ve done this drill at least ten times. When
you’re comfortable, and you’re sure your form is good, you can progress
beyond the catch-up stroke and begin the natural alternating stroke,
where you pull one arm back while the other is still coming forward.
EXTRA TIPS
You may at first find yourself concentrating on either the kick or the arm
stroke, to the detriment of the other. Don’t worry. The easier and more
habitual one becomes, the easier it’ll be to transfer your attention to the
other. But that doesn’t mean that you should avoid practicing your weak
area in the meantime. If putting it all together is still a problem, try this
intermediate step: practice your arm motion in chest-deep water,
walking forward to simulate the flutter kick. Remember your form: arms
straight during the pull, elbows high during the recovery. If you still
need a little assistance, whether it’s your partner, a kickboard, or placing
one hand on the wall of the pool, rely on it for support as long as you
need to. But only for as long as you need to. Gradually wean yourself
away from all assistance, by letting go with your supporting hand for
gradually longer periods of time.
Or you may find it easier to begin with the flutter kick after the push-
off, then add the arm motion, instead of the other way around.
BENEFITS
Once you’ve combined these two skills, you’ve reached a milestone in
your swimming career. There’s only one more skill to learn before you’re
a real swimmer.
Flutter Kicking and Rhythmic Breathing
If you can combine your kicking with your breathing, you’re well on
your way to putting together all the components of the crawl stroke.

--- Page 79 Text ---
HOW TO DO IT
Begin by crouching down so that the surface of the water is at shoulder
level. Turn your head to your breathing side and rest your cheek on the
water. Inhale; then exhale and pivot your face down into the water.
When you run out of air, pivot your head back up to the side and inhale.
Exhale as you pivot your face into the water again. Your head should be
parallel to the bottom of the pool, and you should be looking straight
down toward your feet. Repeat this at least ten times. Rest, and repeat
another ten times.
Now let’s add the kicking. Hold on to the wall in the prone flutter kick
position—one hand grasping the top of the wall and pulling, the other
placed flat, fingers facing downward, against the wall below the surface
and pushing. So breathing will be easier, make the lower arm the one on
your breathing side, and place it a little farther below the water’s surface
than usual.
Begin rhythmic breathing as you did before, but let your legs come up
to the surface, and begin flutter kicking. Continue flutter kicking and
breathing rhythmically for ten cycles; rest, and repeat.
Practice flutter kicking and rhythmic breathing, using the same
progression as for regular flutter kicking—first with assistance (a
partner, a kickboard, or the wall), then unassisted—until the
coordination is comfortable.
EXTRA TIPS
If you find that your body begins to bend, make sure that both arms are
perfectly straight. If you’re not getting enough air, you may not be
turning your head enough. So straighten out—stretch those arms and
legs, and push those hips down. Streamline your body, and try to turn
your head fully to get a good bite of air. If you’re having trouble, try
going back to just kicking or just breathing for a while. Then come back
and combine them.
BENEFITS

--- Page 80 Text ---
By combining your breathing skills with one other skill at a time, you
are coordinating in gradual steps this most important component for
comfortable swimming. The breathing is the key—once you know you
can get enough air whenever you want to, you’ll have the confidence to
add other skills to your swimming repertoire.
Crawl-stroke Arm Motion and Rhythmic Breathing
Now to combine the last two skills you’ve learned, the crawl-stroke arm
motion and rhythmic breathing, just as you practiced on land.
HOW TO DO IT
Remember the “Law of Opposites”—when you inhale to the right, your
left arm is forward and your right arm is back out of the way. To put the
law to use, stand in chest-deep water, bending forward so that the water
is at shoulder level. If you breathe to the right, drop your right arm
down and back, stretch your left arm straight ahead, and rest your left
cheek on the water. Inhale; then exhale underwater as you complete the
stroke cycle. Rest, then repeat the arm motion, combining the exhaling
and inhaling with each stroke just as you did on land. Practice this skill
until it’s comfortable.
When you’re ready, do the same progression that you did for the
crawl-stroke arm motion without the breathing—first walking through
the water, then in the prone position with assistance from a partner,
kickboard, or the pool wall, then without assistance.
EXTRA TIPS
Be sure to get the opposition that the “Law of Opposites” demands. If
you have trouble coordinating the breathing and the arm motion, go
back to the catch-up stroke to slow the whole process down. And
remember the 30-to 45-degree downward angle of the hands on entry,
along with the 90-degree downward and backward pulling arc

--- Page 81 Text ---
Crawl Stroke, Flutter Kicking, and Rhythmic Breathing
This is it, the last and most exhilarating step in doing the crawl stroke.
HOW TO DO IT
Review just the arm motion and the kicking for a minute. Then take a
deep breath and swim as far as you can before coming up for air. Repeat
about five times. The next time, when you need to come up for air, try to
take a rhythmic breath by inhaling on your breathing side once; then
continue until you have to come up for air again. Stop, rest, and
continue, trying to improve your form and to increase steadily the
number of consecutive rhythmic breaths you take each time.
EXTRA TIPS
Remember, your elbow is the last thing to enter the water during the
catch, and the first thing to break the surface after the pull.
BENEFITS
The combination of these three skills is the basis of the crawl stroke, or
freestyle. If you’ve swum before, I hope that this will break forever your
habit of doing what I call the “Coney Island crawl”—head above water,
flopping awkwardly from side to side with every stroke. That’s an
inefficient and tiring way to swim. With rhythmic breathing, you’ll find
that you can do the crawl for much longer than you ever thought
possible.
Cool-down
Time to relax with some gentle swimming movements. Practice the
crawl-stroke arm motion, first standing in place, then walking forward.
Remember your technique: put your thumbs together, stretch your arms

--- Page 82 Text ---
straight out in front of you, pull your arm straight down and back as far
as it’ll go, then bend the elbow high as you return to the starting
position.
The crawl stroke.
The catch.
The pull.
The recovery.

--- Page 83 Text ---
Next, practice the pairs of skills you learned today—rhythmic
breathing and the crawl stroke, first standing in place, then walking
forward as the pull of the stroke propels you through the water. Next
move on to the second pair: flutter kicking and rhythmic breathing.
Finally, if you have the energy, practice combining the arm motion with
the flutter kick. (If you want to take it easy, just do the prone flutter
kick, either unassisted or while holding on to the wall or a kickboard.)
Homework
You have a lot of homework this time, but it’ll be worth it. Continue
practicing your controlled breathing, flutter kicking, bobbing, and the
crawl-stroke arm motion. It’s tough to combine the arm motion with the
flutter kick on dry land, so try to get yourself to the water as often as
you can. In the meantime, practice the arm motion in front of a mirror
to check your form. If you want, isolate each arm at first, then go on to
the alternating catch-up stroke. Add rhythmic breathing to your arm
motion practice as well as to your flutter kicking.
Practice your rhythmic breathing in a tub of water, making sure that
you don’t just lift your head up for air—you should really pivot at the
neck.
For best results, do some conditioning exercises at least three times a
week.
It might take you a little longer to feel that you’ve mastered this
lesson. But really, this final step is simply one of coordination—and that
just takes some getting used to. To do that, you must practice, practice,
practice. You can do it—just keep at it, slowly but surely, to ensure that
your form stays as good as it is when you practice the skill separately.
If you’re really struggling with the coordination, don’t worry. Go on to
learn other skills in the next lessons if you’re uncomfortable in the prone
position, or with your head in the water. Don’t ignore your prone skills
completely; keep plugging away at what you can do, and gradually
you’ll notice improvement. Besides, mastering other skills will give you
confidence that will help you eventually to conquer the things that are a
little stubborn right now.

oday you’re going to learn a simple safety skill that will enable you to
stay afloat in deep water for a long time while using very little energy.
As before, you’ll first familiarize yourself with the motions on dry
land. Each part—sculling with the arms and bicycling with the legs—is
explained separately first; then you’ll learn how to combine them.
D -L /P S
RY AND REP KILLS
I hope you’ve been doing your conditioning exercises regularly. Do them
again today as part of your prep skills.
Review Skills
Practice your controlled breathing, flutter kicking, bobbing, and prone
skills.
Sculling for Treading
This is the first step in learning how to move on your back. It’s also
similar to what the top half of you is doing when you’re treading water,
which you’ll be introduced to in this lesson.
HOW TO DO IT
Sit with your arms extended in front of you, parallel to the floor, with
thumbs up and palms facing each other. Now create a figure 8 motion

--- Page 85 Text ---
with each arm like this: holding your hands at about waist level, fingers
held loosely together, turn your thumbs down and press your arms out
away from each other until they’re about shoulder width apart; then
turn your thumbs up again and press your arms toward each other until
the palms touch. You’re now back to starting position.
Continue forming the figure 8 until you’re sure of this skill.
EXTRA TIPS
On the outward press, make sure that your hands extend out to the sides
and back beyond your shoulders.
BENEFITS
This is a smooth, effective stroke that plays an important role in
treading. Even if you already know how to tread, your technique can
probably stand improvement. Wait till you try this in the water—you’ll
see what a difference an efficient sculling motion can make.
Bicycle Leg Motion for Treading
Now for the other half of this skill. Relax a moment, and take this one
sitting down.
HOW TO DO IT
Sit up straight on the edge of a chair. Then simply imagine that you’re
pedaling a bicycle. Bring alternate legs up, knees bent toward your chest.
As one leg comes down, flex that foot (which means ankle is bent
upward, with the toes now pointing up) and raise the other. Continue
alternating the legs, letting each foot rest only a moment on the ground
before you raise it up again.
EXTRA TIPS

--- Page 86 Text ---
If you need to, hold on to the edge of the seat for leverage. No need to
hurry when you kick this way, either now or when you get into the
water.
BENEFITS
This exercise works the quadriceps or thigh muscles.
Treading (Sculling and Bicycle Leg Motion Combined)
On land this looks like an egg beater gone wild, but it really works well
in the water, so practice the coordination before you get into the pool.
HOW TO DO IT
From a sitting position, begin the sculling motion with your arms. This
time, add the bicycle leg motion, really bringing those knees up.
EXTRA TIPS
Make sure you don’t forget the proper form for each individual skill
when you combine them. Keep your hands relatively flat and sweep your
hands way out to the sides and back beyond your shoulders. Keep your
arm motions large and relaxed.

ATER KILLS
Warm-up and Review Skills
After your conditioning exercises, review your breathing, flutter kicking,
bobbing, and prone skills while sitting on the edge of the pool.
Buoyancy Check
And now for something completely different. This is an interesting little
test to prove what I’ve been telling you all along: the water makes you
so buoyant that it’s actually difficult for a person to sink!
HOW TO DO IT

--- Page 88 Text ---
That depends on what’s available. Ask the lifeguard whether the pool
has an extension pole, which is usually used as a lifesaving device. If not,
improvise with a broom handle or reasonable facsimile. For this you also
need someone to hold the pole for you. Go to water about as deep as you
are tall. Have your helper hold the pole vertically near the wall, with the
tip touching bottom. Wrap your feet around the pole, crossing them at
the ankles; this will prevent your legs from floating up. Grasp the pole
with both hands, one under the other. Take a deep breath, and begin to
exhale slowly with controlled breathing as you work your way down the
pole, hand under hand, as if sliding down a rope. Go down as far as is
comfortable, stay there for a few seconds; then loosen your grip a bit
(don’t let go completely) and you’ll pop right back up.
Notice how much effort it took to get your body underwater—and to
stay there. Did you feel how easily you rose to the surface? That’s
because the buoyancy of the water naturally pushed you up.
EXTRA TIPS
If you can’t find a suitable pole, and if you’re practicing on your own,
you can use the pool ladder. Slide down, hand under hand along the
railing; or use the ladder’s steps as handholds and climb down that way.
(You’ll have to hook your feet under each step to keep the lower part of
your body from floating up.)
Make sure that you take a deep enough breath before you slide down,
and that you release it underwater as slowly as you can. This is where
your controlled breathing comes in handy. While you’re down there,
take a look around, try to absorb the feeling of being underwater, and
relax!
BENEFITS
This will add to your confidence and should help you to stop fighting the
water and let it start working for you. Many people make the mistake of
struggling in the water; they try to stay on top of it instead of in and
through it They don’t realize that the water will support the body weight

--- Page 89 Text ---
of an average human being. That’s a fact—whether you’re male, female,
skinny as a rail, or big as a whale. You don’t even have to move to float;
the water will hold you up, if you let it.
Deep-water Tour
Next, do a little traveling—to the deep end of the pool. You’ll discover
that everything you’ve learned works in deep water too.
HOW TO DO IT
Since we’re moving into deep water, make positively sure that someone
capable of helping you is around. My method for getting you there and
back is absolutely safe, but regardless of your level of ability, you should
never swim alone.
To get there, begin by grasping the edge of the pool with both hands.
Then slide one hand toward the deep end and bring the other hand to
meet it. Continue “side-stepping” with your hands along the edge of the
pool wall until the water is at least over your head. Now you’re going to
try some of your warm-up skills.
Bobbing: Holding on to the edge of the pool with both hands, bob
down as far as your arms will let you. Make sure you extend them as
straight as possible. Repeat at least ten times. Now let go with one arm
and bob another ten times; switch hands and bob ten times again.
Buoyancy Check: Interrupt your warm-up here to see how the
buoyancy test works in deeper water. Again, have someone hold the pole
for you (or improvise with the steps of a ladder). Cross your ankles
around the pole and, in a hand-over-hand motion, slide down the pole.
Slide up—you’ll pop up out of the water.
Flutter Kicking: Holding on to the wall, do some supine kicking first.
Then do some flutter kicking in a prone position, adding your rhythmic

--- Page 90 Text ---
breathing. Remember, to give your head enough room, you may need to
slide the hand on your breathing side farther down along the pool wall.
Think about your controlled breathing, slowing it down, just as you do
in shallow water.
Prone Skills: Just go as far as you comfortably can this time. Start by
holding on to the pool edge with one hand, your side to the wall. Begin
bobbing up and down, sliding your hand along the wall and moving
forward, still holding on to the edge. Then go into the prone float
position and begin to do the crawl stroke with your free arm. When
you’re comfortable with that, add rhythmic breathing and flutter kicking
in whatever sequence feels best for you. Then turn around and try this
on your other side. If you can, let go of the wall completely and swim
the crawl stroke across the width of the pool, staying close to the end
wall, and with a partner or lifeguard nearby.
EXTRA TIPS
Try to keep just as relaxed in deep water as you are in shallow water. As
I’ve said before, you will naturally float in water. Here’s why:
Archimedes’ Law states that a body submerged in liquid is buoyed up by
a force equal to the weight of the liquid it displaces. The specific gravity
of water is 1.0; yours is less than that. So the water your body displaces
weighs more than you do, and therefore holds you up. Just how buoyant
you are depends upon your body type. Bones and muscle are denser than
adipose tissue (fat), so thin, big-boned, or muscular people are less
buoyant than those with a layer of fat.
BENEFITS
This “tour” may be to a totally foreign country for some of you; for
others, deep water is a welcome old friend. For everybody, it’s a
reminder that, no matter how deep the water is, it’s only water—there’s
just more of it under you, helping to buoy you up. Relax and let that
buoyancy work for you.

Treading (Chin-deep Water)
Back to familiar ground. It’s time to learn how to tread in the water.
HOW TO DO IT
To begin, stand in chest-deep water and review the sculling motion.
Make a figure 8 with each arm, keeping your arms at approximately
chest level. Then bend your knees and add the bicycle motion, keeping
your knees up high, as if you were bicycling. Try not to let your feet
touch bottom.
Treading in chin-deep water.
When you have the feel for this sculling and bicycling, walk your way
to chin-deep water. You should still be able to touch ground when your

--- Page 92 Text ---
legs are straight, but not when they’re bent in the bicycling position. As
your feet come off the pool bottom, bend forward at the waist in
addition to at the knees, so that you have more room to kick.
EXTRA TIPS
Remember to use a wide, figure 8 motion with your hands—the more
water you push down, the more easily you’ll stay up. If your feet touch
bottom now and then, just push off again and continue.
BENEFITS
Treading is a skill that may save your life someday, so, although it’s not
a swimming stroke per se, it’s important for you to know. It can also
become a part of your fitness program, as a relaxing skill between more
strenuous swims.
Cool-down
Practice your prone skills—individually if any are still proving less than
perfect, then together in whatever combination you like. Next, put it all
together—crawl-stroke arm motion, flutter kicking, and rhythmic
breathing—and try to swim across the entire width of the pool. If you
can’t do it, that’s okay, but it’s not too early to begin to push yourself, to
ask yourself to do a little more than you’re used to. After all, that’s how

n this lesson you’ll learn how to float and flutter kick in the supine
(face-up) position. You may prefer this position to the prone position,
because here your face remains above the water line, and you don’t have
to coordinate your breathing with each stroke. In this lesson you’ll also
move your treading to deep water.

Review Skills
Practice your breathing, flutter kicking, bobbing, prone skills, and

Now you’re ready to begin something new—the first step toward
swimming the backstroke.
Supine Float and Recovery
HOW TO DO IT
Begin this skill by lying in bed or on the floor. Stretch out on your back,
arms to your sides with palms facing down. Notice how your chest is
slightly raised and your abdomen completely flat. Everything is level and

--- Page 95 Text ---
you’re relaxed because your mattress or floor is supporting you. That’s
the position you’ll take and the feeling you’ll get when you try this in the
water.
Supine (back) float.
Recovery to a stand from the supine (back float) position.
So much for the “float.” To practice the recovery, stand up with feet
together, arms straight out to your sides at shoulder level and parallel to
the floor. To initiate the recovery, imagine that someone has punched

--- Page 96 Text ---
you—hard—in the stomach. In addition to uttering a few choice words,
this would cause you to bend over at the waist with the hips back, in
what’s known as a pike position. Assume this position. Then bend your
knees and drop your chin. Reach behind you with straight arms in a
forward scooping motion. As your arms continue to brush the back of
your knees, begin to straighten your legs. Continue to move your arms
forward until they’re in front of you, straightening and extending your
legs completely as you do so, until you’re standing up straight. Practice
this movement five times. Each time, repeat to yourself the key words,
“Pike, bend, scoop, and stand.”
If you’re working with a partner, practice supporting each other
during the recovery. The helper stands directly behind the floater and
places his palms, fingers down, at the small of the floater’s back to
support him as he recovers.
EXTRA TIPS
To help you get a better feel for the recovery, pretend that the punch
was so hard that you need to sit down. Grab in back of you for an
imaginary chair; then sit down as you bend your knees. Finally, change
your mind and stand up instead, raising your arms in front of you, as if
you were carrying a tray of hot soup, until they’re parallel to the floor.
BENEFITS
This exercise will help you to remember to stretch out and relax during
the supine float. The recovery, conversely, will let you return to a
standing position smoothly and safely.

ATER KILLS
Warm-up
Get your body ready for the water by doing some Swimmers’ Shape-up

--- Page 97 Text ---
exercises and by reviewing all of your dry-land/prep skills.
Then continue your warm-up in the water by practicing your bobbing
and prone skills.
Supine Float and Recovery
HOW TO DO IT
First practice just the recovery to see how the water’s natural resistance
will help you return to a standing position. Stand in chest-deep water
with your arms extended straight out to your sides, parallel to the
bottom of the pool. Pike from that punch, reach back and down, bending
your knees and dropping your head to look at them; finish the upward
arm movement and straighten your legs. When that feels comfortable,
try it for real from a floating position as follows.
Without a Partner: Go to the corner of the pool—once again, it’s the
best seat in the house—and support yourself by grasping the sides as you
did for the supine flutter kick (this page). Squat down so that your
shoulders are at water level, with one foot slightly in front of the other.
Put your head back (rest it on the gutter if you can), arch your back, and
push up with the back foot; let both legs float up to the surface of the
water. Stay there for a few seconds; then recover as you did before, by
bending your hips and body forward. Release your hands from the wall
and scoop forward as your legs touch bottom.
When you’re ready, practice this using only one arm as a support.
Stand with one shoulder against the side of the pool and grab the edge
of the wall with the nearer hand. Then bend down so that the water is
up to your shoulders, tilt your head back, and let your chest and legs rise
into the floating position; your free arm is relaxed and floating palm up.
Then recover, using one arm to scoop. Repeat five times; then practice
holding on with your other arm. Finally, when you feel ready, let go of
the wall altogether and use both your arms to recover.

--- Page 98 Text ---
With a Partner: The floater stands with his arms out to his sides,
palms up. With his partner supporting him at the small of the back,
fingers pointed downward, the floater begins the supine float as
described above. Float for at least five seconds; then recover to a
standing position. Repeat, adding a few seconds each time, until you can
float for fifteen seconds. Then switch with your partner. When this
position feels comfortable, try using gradually less support until you are
floating unassisted.
EXTRA TIPS
In the recovery, the more you pike, the easier it will be to go from a
horizontal to a vertical position. If your partner is having trouble piking
enough, put your hands around his or her waist, fingers forward, as you
did during the dry-land practice. During the recovery, pull back gently to
help the piking action.
Another way to practice this skill is to hold a kickboard over your
abdomen as you float. Hold it lightly, with your fingertips just resting on
the side edges. Then bring the board to one side of you and hold it there
with one hand while you scoop with the other hand to perform the
recovery. As your feet approach the bottom, let go of the kickboard.
Check to see that you aren’t doing the Irish jig (or any other dance)
during the recovery. Keep your legs primly together the whole time:
while you’re floating, while they’re bending, and while they’re
straightening out. And make sure that both feet touch bottom together.
Remember, form counts.
BENEFITS
The supine float is the basis for swimming on your back. This is also
another step in establishing your water confidence. And since you’ve
learned the recovery to a stand, you know that you can safely right
yourself at any time.
Supine Float with Flutter Kicking

--- Page 99 Text ---
HOW TO DO IT
To begin the supine float, walk backward, lean back, and lift your feet
from the floor of the pool. Once you’re floating, begin to flutter kick. As
before, use a partner or the wall to assist you if you need to at first; then
gradually use less and less help until you can float and flutter kick
unassisted. Practice until comfortable.
EXTRA TIPS
Try to get a relaxed, stretched, and streamlined feeling along your body
and all across your abdomen, chest, shoulders, and upper arms. Tuck
your hips in and under. Avoid “sitting” in the water; don’t bend at the
waist until you’re ready to recover to a stand. Keep your chest high and
your head back. Arch your back slightly—especially if your hips tend to
sink.
Remember your kicking form—legs straight, ankles relaxed, just
making the water “boil.” You can sneak a peek at your legs in the supine
position, so use the opportunity to acquire a feel for how a perfect flutter
kick is done.
BENEFITS
Adding the flutter kick to the supine float helps you maintain a better
body position: chest high, legs close to the surface. It also prepares you
for the next step in learning how to swim on your back—the sculling
arm motion.
Deep-water Treading
HOW TO DO IT
Without a Partner: Standing in chest-deep water, with one side
toward the pool wall, hold on to the edge with the hand. Begin the

--- Page 100 Text ---
bicycle leg motion, and start sculling with your free arm. Tread water for
approximately one minute; then grasp the wall with both hands, turn
around, and tread for another minute, sculling with your other arm.
Next, with your hand still on the wall, relax into the prone float (or
supine float, if you prefer). Go completely limp, and hold your body
absolutely motionless while you exhale during the prone float. When
you need to come up for air, recover, using your free arm to pull you
back up to a vertical position; immediately resume treading water.
Repeat the treading on the other side. Keep alternating sides, lifting your
arm and letting go of the wall—for a second or two at first, then for
gradually longer periods until you feel comfortable sculling with both
arms.
With a Partner: Take this intermediate step. Both partners face the
same direction, holding on to the wall with the nearer hand. The person
in front is the treader; the one in back is the supporter. The supporter
grips the treader’s bathing suit by the strap or by the waist and pulls
upward. The treader begins to bicycle with his or her legs and to scull
with the free arm. Then, when the treader feels the upward tug on the
suit, he or she lets go of the wall and starts to scull with both arms at the
same time. Alternate positions five times; then gradually lighten the
support and let your partner tread water more and more on his or her
own.
When you feel comfortable doing this exercise in shallow water, move
into deep water (as you did for the buoyancy check) and practice this
skill there.
EXTRA TIPS
Remember, this is the same thing you’ve done in shallow water. The
buoyancy check showed you how difficult it is to sink even if you do
absolutely nothing. By treading, you should stay up easily. So relax. Use
a slow, sweeping motion, crossing your hands in front—and reaching
your back in order to get the most vertical thrust.

--- Page 101 Text ---
BENEFITS
Your ability to tread in deep water enables you to remain calm and
afloat whenever your other strokes are interrupted—say, by another
swimmer. Any time any disturbance changes your position in the water,
just tread until you can resume normal swimming. When you’re
treading, your arms and legs stay completely underwater—that’s a very
efficient use of energy, which is why you can tread water for so long,
especially when you combine it with the prone or supine float.
Cool-down
Review all your skills, both the new and the old—prone float, kicking,
recovery, crawl stroke with rhythmic breathing (separately, then
together), treading in chin-deep water, supine float, and supine kicking
on the wall.
Homework
In front of a mirror, practice your form for the crawl stroke, prone and
supine recovery, and sculling. Do your flutter kicking and bicycling in
spare moments. Review your rhythmic breathing in a basin of water.
Concentrate on stretching out your arms, shoulders, and sides when you
exercise—you’ll need those muscles even more for the next lesson.

ext you’ll learn a variation of the sculling motion that you can do
while on your back. And you’ll get ready for a new kind of plunge into
the water—a head-first entry.
D -L /P S
RY AND REP KILLS
Begin as you usually do, with Swimmers’ Shape-ups, to prepare you
mentally and physically for water action.
Review Skills
Practice your breathing, flutter kicking, bobbing, prone skills, treading,
and supine skills.
Supine Sculling
This is one of the intermediate steps in learning the backstroke and is a
variation of the sculling motion that you have already used for treading.
HOW TO DO IT
Stand up straight and begin to do the sculling motion—figure 8s with
both arms—that you learned for treading. Now modify it a bit: begin to
make smaller movements, about shoulder width apart. Then gradually
drop your hands to hip level, and finally bring your hands behind your
hips, still forming figure 8s.

--- Page 103 Text ---
Practicing sculling.
EXTRA TIPS
This is a variation of the treading arm motion, so it shouldn’t present a
problem. And supine sculling will feel more natural underwater, where
you will use it to propel you backward while your feet flutter kick. For
more power and leverage, remember to keep your hands sculling as
close under your hips as possible.
BENEFITS
This arm motion will help you to feel more balanced and more
comfortable on your back.
Sculling is also a great and relaxing way to really tone up your arms.
So don’t give it short shrift. It’s simple but effective, and it has a part to

--- Page 104 Text ---
play in your personal fitness program.
Introduction to Head-First Entries (Diving)
Until now, you’ve been entering the water feet first. Head-first entries
are a more efficient way to initiate prone skills, are more exciting, and
are fun!
The progression of head-first entries is called the diving sequence. For
shallow surface and sitting entries, your feet begin in the water rather
than on the pool deck. For safety considerations, these entries should
take place in water at least five feet deep. All other dives should be done
in water not less than nine feet deep, as recommended by the American
National Red Cross. These dives include kneeling, tip-in, standing, and
racing, and will be highlighted in Part Three.
HOW TO DO IT
Begin by sitting up straight in a chair. With feet shoulder-width apart
and knees bent, rise up on your toes, hips back, and heels resting against
the legs of the chair. Extend your arms straight in front of you and put
your head down, as you would for the prone glide. Make sure that your
arms cover your ears, and that your chin is tucked to your chest. Then
just straighten your knees and stand up into the prone glide. Finally,
practice your recovery to a stand.
EXTRA TIPS
A head-first entry is really only an extension of the push-off into the
prone float, which you already know. To help you to keep your chin
tucked firmly into your chest, imagine that you’re holding a gold pencil
there, or something else that you wouldn’t want to drop.

Then continue the warming-up process in the water.
Review Skills
Practice your bobbing, prone skills, treading, and supine skills.
Supine Sculling with Flutter Kicking
Now to add some arm and leg action to the back float.
HOW TO DO IT
Standing in chest-deep water, review the sculling arm motion that you
learned as part of treading. Make figure 8s with each arm, weaving them
first away, then toward each other. Gradually bring the motion down
around your hips, making the loops smaller and smaller, then move your
hands behind your hips. Next, begin to walk backward (this is the
direction you’ll be moving while on your back), as you push water
forward.
Next, stand with one foot slightly in front of the other and push off
into the supine float, still sculling; after a few sculls, add a flutter kick to
help your legs stay up and to help propel you through the water. When
you’re ready, recover to a standing position.
EXTRA TIPS
This is a matter of getting your coordination together. You will probably
find it easier than the crawl stroke, where you have to coordinate
rhythmic breathing, and where your arms are moving alternately. Here,
your head stays above water, and both arms are doing the same thing at

--- Page 106 Text ---
the same time, so this should be an easy stroke, and a welcome change.
If you need it, have your partner support you, or support yourself on
the pool wall as you did when you learned the supine float. Do whatever
is comfortable. If you find it easier to begin kicking first, then add the
sculling, go ahead and do it that way. But when you combine the two
skills, don’t concentrate on one to the exclusion of the other. Make sure
you’re doing them both simultaneously, in a continuous motion.
Try to keep splashing to a minimum; it’s a waste of time and energy.
Remember, in order to move forward, you have to push water, not air.
BENEFITS
This is the final step before learning the elementary backstroke. Your
coordination should be superb by now.
Introduction to Shallow Surface Entry
HOW TO DO IT
Begin by practicing the prone glide and recovery. As you do, be
particularly conscious of the push-off from the wall and of your
streamlined body position.
Then sit on the edge of the pool or on the top step of the ladder or the
steps at the shallow end. Push off from the side of the pool, as you did
before to start the prone glide, but this time tuck your chin tightly to
your chest and angle your arms down about 30 degrees to propel your
body just beneath the surface. As you start to lose momentum, arch your
back slightly and lift your chin a little to the surface in a prone glide.
Recover to a stand. Repeat this shallow surface dive at least five times,
or until you’re comfortable with it.
EXTRA TIPS
If you have trouble with this part, relax and go on to something else,

--- Page 107 Text ---
then come back to the shallow surface dive in a little while. If you’ve
never dove before, getting over this first hurdle is the most challenging
part, so don’t push yourself too fast.
If you get water up your nose, check to see that you’re beginning to
exhale, expecially through your nostrils, just before your head enters the
water.
Shallow surface entry.
Speaking of heads, make sure to keep yours tucked down. Remember
that gold pencil you’re holding. Raising the head is the single most
common fault divers make, and it’s the cause of all those belly whops.
The body follows the head through space, so if the head pops up, so does
the body—and, in a dive, you want to enter the water in a smooth,
downward arc. Get into the habit of really tensing your abdominal and
leg muscles when diving, for an extended, clean body line.
Whenever you’re making a head-first entry, be sure that your arms
cover your ears, and that your hands are stretched out straight in front
of you to protect your head. If your hands tend to separate on entry,
hook your thumbs or grasp one wrist with your other hand.
Cool-down
Practice all your skills—supine, prone, and treading—for a few minutes,
paying particular attention to your form. Remember to be conscious of

--- Page 108 Text ---
the whole skill and not just the individual parts—think about your
kicking and arm motion together. If you need to, go back and practice
the parts individually until you’re sure of them. Add rhythmic breathing
when you practice prone flutter kicking on the wall; add controlled
breathing during the prone float. Do some push-offs and practice a few
head-first entries, using the pull-up exercise instead of the stairs to get
you out of the water.
Homework
Keep practicing your rhythmic breathing in a basin of water, and when
you review your crawl stroke on land. This is the part most people have
trouble with, no matter how long they’ve been swimming. Remember
the “Law of Opposites.” Practice your other skills, too—sculling,
treading, bobbing, and flutter kicking—while watching TV or in front of
the mirror. Not only will this improve your form, it’ll help tone and
strengthen your muscles.

n this lesson you’ll learn the elementary backstroke. This is primarily a
resting or survival stroke and is quite easy and pleasant to do. Since both
arms do the same thing at the same time, it’s simpler than the
alternating (“windmill”) backstroke that you’ll learn next. Eventually,
the elementary-backstroke arm motion will be combined with a new
kick, which is explained in the next lesson.
This lesson will also teach you how to dive from a sitting position,
which is the next step in learning this other new skill.
Of course, you’ll also continue to practice and improve the prone and
supine skills you already know, as well as your treading.

Elementary Backstroke Arm Motion
You’ll like this one—even on dry land it gives you a nice stretch, but
wait until you try it in water and you feel the restful glide from this

--- Page 110 Text ---
stroke.
HOW TO DO IT
Stand up straight, with your back arched slightly and your hands at your
sides. This will be your resting, or glide, position. For the recovery of this
stroke, imagine that you have an itch all along the sides of your torso.
Slide your fingertips along your sides, keeping your elbows back and
close to your body as they bend. When your fingertips are near your
armpits and you just can’t go any higher, straighten your arms, still
keeping them as far back as they’ll go, and raise them in a V shape, out
behind your head, palms facing downward and out. Pause a second (this
is the catch of the stroke) and try to reach back another inch.

The recovery.

--- Page 112 Text ---
The catch position before the pull.
For the power part of the stroke, or the pull, keep your arms straight
and snap them down quickly so that they slap your outer thighs. Hold
them in this position for a second (the glide) before you begin the cycle
all over again. Repeat five to ten times while standing in place; then
walk backward as you do the arm stroke, to simulate the flutter kicking
that you’ll be doing in the water.
EXTRA TIPS
Make sure that you slide your hands along your sides and that you keep
your chest forward. If you’re wearing clothing with a side seam, run
your fingers along the seam as you raise your arms in the recovery. To

--- Page 113 Text ---
help you remember the motion, repeat the key words “up (recovery), out
(catch), together (pull), and glide.” You can also practice this stroke
while lying on the floor or on your bed.
BENEFITS
On land, the elementary backstroke gives you an excellent stretch all
along the upper chest and through the arms, and it develops your triceps
muscles. (This stroke will have even more of a toning effect when you
put the extra resistance of the water to work for you.)
Sitting Dive Entry
HOW TO DO IT
Again, review the prone float and diving position while sitting on a
chair. Extend your arms forward, drop your chin to your chest, and
cover your ears with your arms. Hook your thumbs together and point
your fingers downward at a 30-to 45-degree angle. Lean forward and
press your heels against the chair legs. (Later, you’ll push off from the
pool trough, lifting yourself into a piked-standing position, and ending
up in the water in a prone glide.) Then simulate the recovery to a stand.
Repeat five times.
EXTRA TIPS
Stretch and straighten your body as you stand up to make sure that you
don’t tend to “collapse” in the water later on. Remember to keep your
head down—chin tucked to chest, body streamlined in a perfect stretch.
WATER SKILLS

--- Page 114 Text ---
Warm-up
Again, do some arm and shoulder stretches during the Swimmers’ Shape-

bobbing, prone skills, treading, and supine skills.
Review Skills
Once you’re in the water, keep moving, and practice your bobbing,
prone skills, treading, and supine skills.
Elementary Backstroke with Flutter Kick
Let’s see how great this stroke feels in the water.
HOW TO DO IT
Review this stroke while standing in chest-deep water. Begin in the glide
position with your arms down at your sides, palms against your thighs.
Start the recovery: bring both your arms up, bending the elbows, until
your fingertips are as close to your armpits as you can get them. Then
begin to straighten your arms and extend them up, out, and back (think
of the statue Winged Victory). Try to move them back a little more for the
catch. Then, for the pull, snap your arms straight down until they slap
your thighs. Repeat five times.
Next, bend your knees so that the water is just below your chin. Arch
your back slightly and practice the elementary backstroke while walking
backward. Begin to think about coordinating your breathing with the
stroke: inhale as your arms reach up and your chest expands, and exhale
as your arms snap down. Practice this five times.
The next step is to add the supine flutter kick to the float. First, review
the recovery to a stand a few times. Then, as you begin the float, start to
flutter kick. Next, add the elementary-backstroke arm motion.
Remember, reach up and back in the water, hold a second, then snap
your arms down to your sides, keeping them under the water the entire

--- Page 115 Text ---
time. If you need to, hold on to the wall with one hand at first and
practice a few strokes with one arm at a time, alternately. Or practice
with your partner, using the train-and-engineer position you used to
learn the prone skills. Either way, use gradually less assistance until
you’re eventually doing the stroke on your own.
Remember, if you find it easier, you can begin the stroke with either
the arm motion or the flutter kick.
EXTRA TIPS
After you snap your arms down, hold them by your side a moment so
you can really feel the glide that this stroke gives you. You’ll see how
powerful the stroke can be and what a restful, fluid motion you can get
in the water.
BENEFITS
This smooth, flowing stroke gets you accustomed to swimming on your
back and so leads right up to the familiar windmill backstroke. In the
water, the resistance will make your arm, chest, and shoulder muscles
work even harder than on land, thus helping to fight flabby arms and
droopy chest.
Sitting Dive Entry
When first practicing this head-first entry, you may want to remove your
goggles, if you’re used to wearing them, since they can sometimes shift
annoyingly from the impact of entering the water. Or, if you want to
keep your goggles, just wear them a bit tighter than usual. For safety’s
sake, always make sure that you’re diving into water that’s at least five
feet deep.
Sitting dive entry.

--- Page 116 Text ---
Initial position and entry.
HOW TO DO IT
Practice a few shallow surface entries; then push up and exit the pool.
Sit on the edge of the pool, resting your heels on the back wall of the
gutter, with toes curled around the gutter’s edge, or trough. (If your pool
has no gutter, find a ladder rung or other suitable way to brace
yourself.) Extend your arms, locking thumbs and covering your ears with
your arms. Point your hands down at a 30-to 45-degree angle, tuck your
chin to your chest, and look at the water’s surface three to five feet in
front of you. Begin to exhale as you bend forward from the waist and
roll into the water, pushing against the gutter with your heels and toes
and straightening your legs and body as you do so.
Enter in a streamlined position, making a downward arc in the water
and keeping your arms together and extended in front of you, head still
down. Then point your fingers upward to help your ascent to the
surface. When you approach the surface, you’ll be in the prone glide
position. Recover to a stand, or do a few crawl strokes and then stand.
Rest, and repeat at least five times, using the push-up exit from the pool.
EXTRA TIPS
Practice, practice, practice! Other than that, the most important thing to
remember is to keep your body as taut and streamlined as possible so
that you enter the water cleanly like a knife, fingers first. Tighten your
abdominal and leg muscles and point your toes hard. The head leads the
body, so keep your head tucked down until you’re ready to surface.

--- Page 117 Text ---
Make sure you keep your eyes open at all times so that you know
exactly where you are during the entire dive. Keep your body extended
during the dive, especially during the push-off. Put as much spring and
energy into it as possible, as if you were sprinting for a bus.
Recovery to the surface to prone float position.
BENEFITS
Perhaps learning to dive has been your particular stumbling block. This
can be the case even for good swimmers. But thinking of it as an
extension of the push-off and prone glide you know so well will help you
to overcome any hesitation you’ve felt up to now. Remember, your
mental outlook is an important as your physical performance.
Entering the water head first puts your body in the correct,
streamlined position for beginning the crawl stroke (and the other prone
skills). And the momentum from the dive drives your body forward,
giving you a boost to begin the crawl stroke.
Cool-down
Review all the prone and supine skills you’ve learned thus far, plus
treading. Run through each component separately if you need to
concentrate on some aspect of your form; then combine them to work on
your coordination. Finish with a few practice surface dives or push-offs,
always surfacing into a streamlined prone glide, and perhaps adding a
few crawl strokes. Remember your rhythmic breathing while swimming
the crawl. If you feel particularly energetic, try a sitting dive from the
pool deck to finish off your lesson.
Homework

--- Page 118 Text ---
Go over all your skills, preferably in front of a mirror if there’s no
partner around to check your form. Stretch your body as long as it will
go during the elementary backstroke. And think about your streamlined

with rhythmic breathing.

Whip Kick (Supine Position)
Different from any kick that you’ve learned so far, this is the leg motion
that you’ll be using along with the elementary-backstroke arm motion
that you learned in the last lesson. The good news is that both legs do
the same thing at the same time, so you’ve only one set of movements to
think about.
The whip kick.

--- Page 120 Text ---
Knees bent, legs together, heels dropped toward floor.
Legs snap together.

--- Page 121 Text ---
Finish with legs together, fully extended, toes pointed.
HOW TO DO IT
Sit up straight in a chair, grasping either the edge of the seat or the arms
for leverage. Press your legs together and lift them straight up off the
floor, toes pointed, similar to when you begin flutter kicking. Keep your
knees and thighs close and parallel to each other; then, bending your
knees, drop your heels toward the floor. Keeping your knees close, flex
your feet and rotate them outward, separating them by about hip width.
For the propulsion part of the kick, move your lower legs in an outward
semicircle, snapping them toward each other as they straighten at the
knees. End with your legs together, in a fully extended position with toes
pointed and streamlined; glide for a second. Repeat this five times; rest;
then repeat another five times.
EXTRA TIPS
Try to keep your knees as parallel as possible. Let them come apart
slightly when you rotate your feet outward, but they should still be
closer together than your feet. Your feet and calves should do most of
the moving; the thighs do move, but not as much. To help you remember

--- Page 122 Text ---
the action, repeat the key words: “Bend, extend, snap together, and
glide.”
BENEFITS
Since this is so different from flutter kicking, getting the coordination
correct on land is especially important. The whip kick is useful for
trimming and toning the abdominal muscles and the legs, especially the
inner and outer thighs—areas hard to reach with other forms of exercise.
It also gets your knee and hip joints moving in a new plane, which will
help keep them from stiffening up.
: The whip kick is a relatively new, more effective version of the old
NOTE
frog kick. If you prefer to use the frog kick for any reason (you already
know it, or you have a knee problem) turn to this page, where it is
described as an alternate kick to use with the breaststroke.
Elementary Backstroke with Whip Kick
HOW TO DO IT
Review the arm motion again: bend, extend, snap down, and glide. Then
review the leg motion: bend, extend, snap together, and glide. Notice
that the key words are almost exactly the same, because both arms and
legs move together.
First practice while balancing yourself on the edge of a chair. Do both
motions at once—as you bend your knees, bend your arms; as you
extend and straighten your legs, extend and straighten your arms; as you
bring your legs together, bring your arms down; and as you hold your
legs together, hold your arms at your sides for the glide.
Next, try the coordination standing up. Begin with your arms down at
your sides, legs straight and together. Then bend, extend, and straighten
arms and legs simultaneously—jump with legs apart for the extension,
then jump and bring your legs back together for the snap.

--- Page 123 Text ---
EXTRA TIPS
Both the arms and the legs move in a simultaneous, similar motion. For
the legs, repeat the keywords to yourself: “Bend, extend, snap, and
glide.” This corresponds to “recover, catch, pull, and glide” for the arms.
Begin to coordinate your breathing with your arm and leg movements
for a steadier, more regular stroke: inhale as you bend your legs and
stretch your arms up, and exhale as you snap down with both arms and
legs.
BENEFITS
This particular set of movements stretches your shoulders, sides, arms,
and entire rib cage. And the jumping-jack action will help strengthen
your thighs.

ATER KILLS
Warm-up
Concentrate on stretching out your arms and sides during the Swimmers’
Shape-ups.
Review the swimming skills you’ve learned so far, beginning on dry
land: breathing, flutter kicking, bobbing, prone skills, treading, and
supine skills.
Continue the warm-up in the water with bobbing, prone skills,
treading, and supine skills.
Whip Kick (Supine Position)
HOW TO DO IT
Begin by standing with your back against the pool wall, your arms

--- Page 124 Text ---
extended out away from your sides, and your hands grasping the pool
edge as you do when practicing the supine flutter kick. Pull your legs up
and, keeping them together, extend them just below the surface of the
water, with your toes pointed. Keeping your knees and thighs
underwater, flex your feet and drop your heels down toward the bottom
of the pool. Next, rotate and flex your feet away from each other so that
your toes face outward. Then snap your legs together in a semicircular
motion, being careful not to break the surface of the water. Hold the
extended position for a moment before you begin the next kick. Do ten
kicks; rest, then do ten more.
EXTRA TIPS
If you already know the frog kick, remember that this new version is
narrower. The power comes not so much from the snap of your legs
together as from the pressure exerted when your feet form the
semicircles.
Make sure that your legs come completely together; try to feel your
ankles touch.
As you do the whip kick, keep these key words in mind: “Up (bend
knees), out (extend legs), together (snap legs together), and glide.”
The “egg-beater” variation (see this page) is an excellent way to
improve your whip kick and to strengthen your inner thigh muscles. (It
can also be used during treading as an alternate to the bicycling motion.)
To do it, go to the deep end and, extending your arm straight out to your
side, hold on to the pool wall with one hand. Holding yourself in a
nearly vertical position, do the whip kick with the leg nearer the wall.
Try to touch the wall with your foot while keeping your knee directly
under your chest, then straighten your leg and extend it under your
body. Switch hands and repeat on the other side. Then, while facing the
pool wall and holding on to the edge with both hands, move both legs in
“egg-beater” fashion so that, instead of bending and extending together,
they rotate alternately: as one leg bends, the other is straight.
BENEFITS

--- Page 125 Text ---
Now you’ll see how this kick works against the resistance of the water,
giving your legs and abdominal muscles even more of a workout.
Supine Float and Whip Kick
HOW TO DO IT
First practice the supine float and recovery to refresh your memory.
Then lean backward and give a good push-off from the pool bottom, so
that you assume a supine glide. Your feet should be close together and
close to the surface, and your toes should be pointed. Begin the whip
kick and continue for a minute or so. As before, use some assistance at
first if you need to, then gradually come to perform the skill alone.
EXTRA TIPS
If you’re not using any assistance, you can add some easy sculling to
help keep your upper body afloat and moving. Listen and look carefully
for any splashing—remember, in this kick your feet and legs should stay
underwater at all times. Aim for a smooth, continuous motion, with a
slight pause at the end for the glide.
BENEFITS
This exercise is an intermediate step in learning the elementary
backstroke. And, as you practice, you’re toning your leg muscles,
particularly the inner thigh.
Elementary Backstroke with Whip Kick
You’re now ready to put two and two together (two arms and two legs)
to swim the elementary backstroke. You’ve done all the parts separately
in the water, and you’ve put them all together on land, so this part
should be a snap.

--- Page 126 Text ---
HOW TO DO IT
Floating on your back, review the elementary-backstroke arm motion
with the flutter kick. Practice the recovery to a stand, too. Then,
standing in shallow water, review the arm motion with the whip kick,
doing a “jumping jack” in the water as you did on land. Remember, “up,
out, together, and glide,” with both arms and legs moving together.
Next, push off into the supine float. Your arms should begin the stroke
down at your sides; your legs should be together and straight, with toes
pointed. Begin moving your arms and your legs simultaneously. “Up,
out, together, and glide.” Stop whenever you need to by recovering to a
stand.
The elementary backstroke.
The glide.
The recovery.

--- Page 127 Text ---
The catch, ready for pull.
EXTRA TIPS
Remember, in this stroke the arms and legs “bend, extend, snap, and
glide” together. During the glide, rest a moment. Relax and do nothing—
just feel yourself being propelled through the water from the momentum
of the stroke. When you start to lose that momentum, it’s time to stroke
again, so use this moment to think about beginning the next stroke. Try
to make each complete arm and leg motion carry you as far as possible
(stretching out in a streamlined position helps, so do good form and
muscle strength).
If your body tends to sink, you may be piking at the waist. Be sure to
arch your back, lifting your chest, hips, and abdomen high in the water.
If your face should dip below the surface at any time, remember to
exhale out your nose and mouth until they resurface.
Make sure your arms and legs stay underwater throughout the whole
stroke. There should be no splash. Really flex your feet for propulsion.
Squeeze your legs together quickly and smoothly, and use all of your
muscles to streamline your body during the glide.
When you’re doing this stroke, make sure that you pay attention to the

--- Page 128 Text ---
approaching wall. Sneak a peak in back of you every now and then, and
recover to a stand when you get to the wall. (You could also count the
number of strokes needed to get you across the pool, or make note of
some nearby landmark such as the stairs, a ladder, or an object lying on
the edge of the deck.)
BENEFITS
This is by no stretch of the imagination a racing stroke (although the
early competitive backstroke did resemble it closely), but the elementary
backstroke is a nice, easy, restful skill that also tones and stretches your
arms, thighs, and abdomen. Later on, it will play a part in your fitness
program by allowing you to vary your swims and your pace. Until then,
stretch, relax, and enjoy the stroke.
Cool-down
Swim through all your new and old prone and supine skills. Finish this
lesson with a few shallow surface dives, then a sitting dive, and a push-
up exit.
Homework
Practice the crawl and backstroke arm motions in front of a mirror.
Check your form. Remember, the better your technique, the easier and
more pleasurable swimming will be. Continue to practice your rhythmic
breathing in a vessel filled with water.

nly two more things to learn and practice—the windmill-backstroke
arm motion, and how to turn your body over (to go from a prone
position to a supine position, or vice versa) and change direction in the
water. Once you know how to do that, you’ll have mastered the
fundamentals of swimming and you’ll know all you need to have a safe
and pleasurable time in the water. Moreover, you’ll be in a position to
improve your fitness and your skills even further by following the
Workout Program that begins on this page.

RY AND REP KILLS
Begin with some Swimmers’ Shape-ups, including arm circles, to prepare
you for the windmill backstroke. Then review your skills (even though
some may seem old hat by now, you can always improve on them).
Review Skills
Practice your breathing, flutter kicking, bobbing, prone skills, treading,
and supine skills.
Windmill-backstroke Arm Motion
This alternating arm stroke is the final step in the progression of supine
skills. Later on, you may wish to refine your technique by learning the
bent-arm pull (see this page), but to understand the basics of this stroke,
begin with the simpler straight-arm pull described here.

--- Page 130 Text ---
HOW TO DO IT
Begin by doing the stroke as a catch-up drill, employing the same
principle used to introduce the crawl stroke a few lessons ago. Standing
up, extend both arms straight out in front of you at shoulder level, with
the backs of your hands touching and your palms facing out. Your
thumbs will be down and your pinkies up, fingers held loosely together.
To begin the recovery of the stroke, lift one arm straight up and
overhead, just approaching the midline of your body. Then move your
hand back, pinky downward, another six inches for the catch of the
stroke, still keeping your arm straight. For the pull, simply swing your
arm in back of you in a semicircle. As your thumb brushes past your
thigh, rotate your hand so that your little finger once again leads the
action. Then continue the circular motion until your hand meets your
other hand extended in front of you. Touch the backs of your hands and
hold a moment for the “catch-up.” Then begin the stroke with the other
arm.

--- Page 131 Text ---
Windmill-backstroke arm motion (catch-up position).
When you have the hang of that, begin to alternate arms, so that, as
one is pulling, the other is recovering, and you have a 180-degree angle
of opposition. Do this while walking backward to simulate the
propulsion of the flutter kick. As you walk, move your arms alternately
in a constant motion, rather than one at a time. As a result, they will
never actually touch (or “catch up” with) each other, but will always
rotate directly opposite each other, like the blades of a propeller or
windmill.

EXTRA TIPS
This stroke is very much like the arm circles that you’ve been doing for
quite a while now. Really stretch up and back as you rotate your arms
from the shoulders. Remember to keep your elbows straight but not
rigidly locked throughout the motion.
BENEFITS
This stroke will be faster than sculling or the elementary backstroke
when you try it in the water. In the meantime, practicing it on land will
help firm and stretch your chest, shoulders, back, and arms.

Warm-up
Concentrate on arm and shoulder exercises. Then begin your dry-land
review.
Review Skills
Practice your breathing, flutter kicking, bobbing, prone skills, treading,
and supine skills.
Enter the pool with a sitting dive, swim to the deep end, and continue
your warm-up in the water. Practice some bobbing, prone skills,
treading, and supine skills.
Windmill-backstroke Arm Motion
It’s time to transfer your dry-land skills to the water, and once again to
see how well Newton’s Third Law of Motion Works.

--- Page 133 Text ---
HOW TO DO IT
Begin with a review of the catch-up backstroke in shallow water. Bend
your knees so that the water is at shoulder level. Brace yourself by
placing one foot in front of the other. Extend both arms in front of you
at shoulder level, palms facing outward. Begin the recovery with one arm
by bringing it out of the water (little finger up), lifting it straight
overhead at shoulder width. Press your arm back another six inches for
the catch; then sweep it behind you and down under the water for the
pull As you brush your thigh with your thumb, rotate your arm so that
the little finger faces up again, and continue the circular motion until
your active hand meets the extended one. Hold a moment, and then
begin the stroke with your other arm.
Then proceed to the alternating arm motion. As you did on land,
alternate your stroke so that your arms move continuously and in
opposition to each other. Begin to walk backward in the water. If you
can, lean back slightly in the water to get a body position that more
closely approximates the supine float.
EXTRA TIPS
Remember the three parts of the arm motion—the catch, the pull, and
the recovery. Check to see that your arm position is correct during the
recovery—little finger up, arm straight and directly above your shoulder.
As your hand passes overhead, make sure it stays at shoulder width,
with your little finger first so there’s no splash later on. During the pull,
try to keep your arm straight, and remember to rotate your arm prior to
the recovery, so that pinky lifts first (no splash here either).
Windmill Backstroke with Flutter Kick
This is the last step in learning the basic windmill backstroke. As with all
the other skills, begin with assistance if you need it; then gradually come
to do it unassisted.

--- Page 134 Text ---
The windmill backstroke.
The catch.
The pull.
The right arm is about to begin the recovery, as the left arm is about to begin the catch.
HOW TO DO IT
Begin in a supine float. Then coordinate the arm motion with the kick by
starting with either motion first, then adding the other. If you need

--- Page 135 Text ---
assistance and you have a partner, have him or her stand in back of you
and support you in the train-and-engineer position (engineers, beware of
flying arms), alternately supporting and releasing the hands as they
stroke. If you need some assistance but have no partner, support yourself
by sliding one hand along the pool edge as you flutter kick and do the
backstroke with your free arm. Then turn around and reverse directions,
using the other arm to do the stroke. Use gradually less assistance until
eventually you can do the arm and leg motions together on your own.
When you get tired, recover to a stand.
EXTRA TIPS
Keep your chin near your chest and look toward your feet, so the water
line is just at ear level. If you begin to pike, or “sit,” in the water, try to
keep your chest and shoulders up by pressing your shoulder blades back
and together. If just your legs tend to sink, your head may be too high.
To get a clean, knifelike entry into the water, make sure that your hand
enters with the little finger first. Then to further minimize splash, turn
your little finger up again before you lift your arm from the water for
the recovery. The arm motion accounts for most of the power behind the
stroke, so concentrate on the form and power of your arms, and keep
your kicking relaxed. The kick should be rhythmic and constant, with
about six beats per arm cycle, or three kicks per arm pull. Remember,
kick from the hip, not the knee. Inhale and exhale regularly and
continually, approximately one breathing cycle per arm cycle. If your
face should become submerged for a moment, exhale through both nose
and mouth until it resurfaces.
BENEFITS
In the windmill backstroke, the head, shoulders, and chest ride slightly
higher than your legs. This is called hydroplaning, and, as you’ll see, it’s
an important concept in improving your technique in all the strokes. (In
the backstroke, it has the added benefit of also keeping your head higher
in the water, which makes breathing easier and visibility better.)

--- Page 136 Text ---
Changing Direction and Turning Over
These are two handy safety skills that may come naturally to some, but
may be a mystery to others. If you want to change the direction in which
you are swimming, or change from a prone to a supine position (or vice
versa), here’s how.
HOW TO DO IT
To change direction, reach with your forward arm in the direction you
wish to go, and move your body in a wide semicircle through the water.
Turn your head in the same direction simultaneously, and keep kicking
to maintain a high enough body position.
To turn your body over from one position to another, simply press your
head and one shoulder down into the water, so that your entire body
rotates along the longitudinal axis, like a log.
EXTRA TIPS
If you have trouble mastering the change of direction, you may want to
try going through the vertical treading position as a transitional stage;
scull with one arm to turn your body to face the opposite direction, with
your legs bending, tucking, and then bicycling as they help you make the
change.
Once the head turns in the direction you wish to roll, the shoulders
and hips will follow.
Cool-down
Rest a few minutes before you put all the skills you’ve learned together
into a mini-workout.
Exit the pool, push-up style. Then reenter the water with a sitting
dive, and surface into a prone glide. When the glide slows down, begin
the crawl stroke with rhythmic breathing; swim toward the deep end,
and rest whenever you need to by recovering to a vertical position and

--- Page 137 Text ---
treading water. Then resume swimming until you reach the other end.
Tread water for one minute at the deep end; then return to the shallow
end, using your supine skills: the elementary or windmill backstroke or
sculling, or any combination of the three. When you’ve finished, do one
minute of bobbing before exiting the pool. As you repeat this lesson,
keep trying to swim farther and farther before you have to tread to rest.
Also practice changing direction and rolling over from the crawl position
to the backstroke position (and vice versa).
Homework
Practice, as they say, makes perfect. That’s especially true for you now.
All you need to do now is perfect your skills so that you’re efficient, and
graceful, too. You can stay at this level the rest of your life and call
yourself a swimmer. Or you can keep going (and I hope you will), by
learning new strokes and further refining the ones you already know.
You can also continue to improve your level of fitness by following the
progressive program that begins on this page. Whatever you decide,
there’s a whole new world open for you to enjoy.
Now that you’ve achieved your first major goal, why not treat yourself
to a new bathing suit, a bathing cap, a new pair of goggles, or a
membership in a health club or other pool facility?
And by the way, welcome to the world of swimming!

ART TWO
THE TECHNIQUES OF SWIMMING

S
TROKE COMPONENTS
C
onsidering how many centuries man has been splashing around, the
swimming techniques used today are relatively recent innovations. These
refinements are largely the result of the needs of competitive swimmers,
for whom every little advantage counts in their endless quest to swim
faster. The old styles were largely a product of simple trial and error. But
recently, swimming techniques have been elevated to a science, making
today’s competitive styles remarkably different from those of even a
decade or two ago. As a result, swimmers’ times have plummeted to the
point where an Olympic champion of ten years ago would have trouble
even qualifying for today’s games.
T A S
HE RT OF WIMMING
What does this have to do with your average fitness swimmer? Well,
swimming faster comes from a more efficient technique, which is more
natural and graceful, and therefore ultimately easier. So, even if you
don’t choose to pit yourself against another swimmer or against the
clock, sharpening your technique will make swimming more pleasurable.
Even if you think you know these strokes, browse through the following
pages. You will almost certainly find tips that will help you improve
your form. You may not be doing the S pattern in the crawl stroke, for
instance. Or perhaps you’re doing the old frog kick instead of the whip
kick with your breaststroke. Take a look at your breathing, your body
position, the angle of your hand as it enters the water. And wouldn’t you
like to know how to make a smooth, fast transitional turn when you
reach the wall of a pool? Or how to enter the water in a clean, graceful
dive?

--- Page 140 Text ---
Swimming is a sport, but it’s also an art. And if it’s to become a part of
your life, wouldn’t you like to do it as well as possible? No matter how
well you swim, you will always be able to do it a little bit (maybe a lot)
better. There’s always a new challenge. I’m still reviewing and perfecting
things I thought I learned years ago.
T B B
HE ASICS AND EYOND
This section picks up where the ten lessons in Part One left off. To get
the most out of it, you should be acquainted with “The Fundamentals of
Swimming”: you should be comfortable floating on your back and on
your stomach (supine and prone positions), you should be able to do the
crawl stroke (also called freestyle) with rhythmic breathing, the
elementary and windmill backstrokes, sculling, deep-water treading,
and, ideally, a sitting dive. If any of these elements are a mystery to you,
go back and review them; they are the foundation on which all strokes,
starts, dives, and turns are built.
Once you’ve learned a skill, always aim for a constant, smooth,
rhythmic motion, with no wasted effort. As you learn and practice, try to
develop your kinesthetic sense—your ability to perceive the relative
position of each part of your body in space (or water). Only when you
have an idea of your body position will you be able to tell when you’re
doing something correctly, or, if you’re performing a skill incorrectly,
how to go about correcting it. Some people have a keener kinesthetic
sense than others, but everyone can improve upon what he has.
So work in front of a mirror first to practice a movement. Then, during
your regular workout at the pool, concentrate on learning or improving
a specific skill. (You’ll see that the workouts in this book do this for you
already.) Practice with a steady buddy or swimming partner as often as
possible. As you progress, watch, ask, and listen to other swimmers.
Regardless of your level, you can still help and correct each other.
S W C
UCCESS ILL OME
You may feel a little stiff and awkward at first, depending on your

--- Page 141 Text ---
physical condition, your age, and your past swimming experience. You
may not be able to do a movement exactly as pictured or described. Your
legs may not snap together briskly, your elbow may not come up quite
high enough, you may have a tough time getting some of the
coordination. If you’re relearning a stroke the right way, you may find it
tough to eradicate years of habit.
Just hang in there and do the best you can. As long as you have the
basic idea, you will approach the ideal more and more every day. If you
have a bad back, stiff shoulder, or trick knee, you may need to
individualize a stroke or two. So, although these techniques work best
for most swimmers, if a particular technique doesn’t work for you after
you’ve given it a good chance, give in to your idiosyncrasies and modify
the technique so that it comes closer to being correct for you.
P G S M
RINCIPLES OF OOD TROKE ECHANICS
As I’ve mentioned earlier, swimming is an art, a sport, and a science. No
matter what the stroke, start, dive, or turn, there are certain basic
principles that apply. Here’s a crash course in fluid mechanics that will
help explain why strokes are done the way they are.
Buoyancy, or Archimedes’ Law: The specific gravity of water is 1.0;
yours is less, which means that you will float. There is a simple,
unchanging principle that explains this phenomenon. Basically, when
any weight is submerged, the water presses in on it from all sides. In the
case of a buoyant object, such as your body, more pressure is exerted
upward than in any other direction. This difference in pressure causes an
upward force, called buoyancy. Since people are naturally buoyant (big-
boned and heavy-muscled types are less buoyant; fat floats better) very
little effort is required to keep afloat. So when you swim, don’t try to
swim on top of the water; swim through it. Devote your energy to
propelling yourself forward, not to staying up. However, the faster you
go, the higher in the water you’ll ride; this is a natural by-product of
greater speed.

--- Page 142 Text ---
Newton’s Third Law of Motion: This one says that, for every action,
there’s an equal and opposite reaction. Swimmers move forward by
pushing back against the water (instead of pushing up and out as many
do). The greater the resistance of the water, the greater the forward
thrust. And since still water provides greater resistance than water that’s
already moving backward, the old straight-arm pull isn’t the most
efficient way to swim. The most effective stroke, instead, is one that’s
curved so that you’re always pushing against a column of “new” or still
water. We’ll discuss this concept in more detail later on.
Bernoulli’s Principle of Streamlining: In order to move through water
most efficiently, your body must pose as little resistance (drag) as
possible. This streamlining effect with Bernoulli’s Principle or Lift Law
allows you to swim faster the higher your upper body rides in the water.
To streamline your body, keep it generally horizontal along the central
axis (your spine) so that all your energy is used for propelling your body
directly forward, and none is wasted by moving it vertically, to the side,
or even backward.
Next, you have to keep in mind how to generate the most power to
propel you forward without destroying the streamlining effect. If you
were an eel or a submarine, this would pose very little problem. But we
land creatures have to move our arms and legs up, down, and around in
order to move, and this interferes with streamlining by increasing our
surface area. The greater the area exposed to the water, the greater the
drag. This is the dilemma that faces every swimmer: how to obtain the
greatest power (using your arms and legs to make the most of the
water’s resistance) while sacrificing the least streamlining (creating as
little resistance as possible on the other parts).
Resistance Check: An Experiment
To help you get a feel for the three principles of stroke mechanics
discussed here—Newton’s Third Law of Motion, streamlining, and
resistance—try this exercise the next time you’re in the water. Although
the experiment deals with only hand position, the principles apply to the

--- Page 143 Text ---
rest of a swimmer’s body as well.
Stand in shoulder-deep water, with one arm extended straight out in
front of you at water level. Pull your arm downward and backward in an
arc, holding your hand in each of the following positions consecutively:
1. Flex your wrist and extend your fingers upward toward the
ceiling (water slides off your hand).
2. Make a fist (feel pressure on your arm, but there is no
“paddle” or “lever” effect of hand).
3. Flex your hand at the wrist, at a 90-degree angle
(“overdigging”—pushing water out and back too soon).
4. Spread your fingers apart, pulling with arm straight
downward (arm slips through water without much power).
Now try this: Slide your hand into the water at a 30-to 45-degree
angle downward, thumb side down. Keep your elbow higher than your
hand, and pull straight through, describing the same arc as you did
before. You will feel a big difference—this is the most efficient way to
press against the water, and you will now feel your body start to move
forward. That’s Newton’s Third Law of Motion using the water’s
resistance to propel you forward.
This experiment also gives you a good “feel” of the water. With every
stroke you should try to hold as much water as possible. Try to get a
good “grip” on it. (However, you should also keep your hand somewhat
relaxed, with fingers straight but slightly apart.)
T S
HE TROKES
In this section, you’ll study the four competitive strokes (the crawl or
freestyle, the backstroke, the breaststroke, and the butterfly) plus a fifth
(the sidestroke).
Which Is the Hardest Stroke? The Fastest?

--- Page 144 Text ---
Of course, it depends on how hard you’re swimming and how efficient
your technique is, but in general terms, here are the strokes ranked from
most strenuous to least strenuous:
Butterfly
Crawl (freestyle)
Backstroke
Breaststroke
Sidestroke
And here are the strokes ranked from fastest to slowest:
Crawl (freestyle)
Butterfly
Backstroke
Breaststroke
Sidestroke
Everyone has a favorite stroke and a least favorite stroke, with the others
falling somewhere in between. But it’s a good idea to learn and practice
as many strokes as you can, because it makes for more interesting
workouts, and because each stroke works your muscles differently.
Stroke Basics
Body Position: In general, the higher your body rides in the water,
with the shoulders slightly higher than the legs, the easier it will be to
swim. But don’t get carried away—remember, we humans move through
water, not on top of it. The water should come to about your hairline.
Arm Motion: No matter how different they seem, all the arm strokes
in this section have these three components in common:

--- Page 145 Text ---
1. They begin with the catch—the angled entry of your hand so
that air bubbles don’t get trapped and your hand doesn’t slip
through the water. This is the ready position during which
you should get a good hold on the water.
2. Next comes the two-phase underwater pull—always some
variation of an elongated S-shaped path that makes the most
use of the water’s resistance. Phase 1 is a diagonal, outward,
and downward movement; you pull water in a semicircle from
about shoulder width back inward to about the mid-line of the
body. Phase 2 is a shorter, accelerated press backward.
Ideally, the second phase supplies most of the power of the
arm stroke.
3. Finally, there’s the recovery, which occurs either over or under
the water, depending on the stroke. This component, which
brings the arm back to the starting position and gives it a
short rest, should be done with as little resistance as possible.
When learning and doing each stroke, review the basic S-shaped path
that your hand and arm follow; this allows you continually to press
“still” water backward.
Leg Motion: The main power from any kind of kick comes from the
large muscles in the hips and thighs. The aim of all strokes is to push
water backward, not to splash water into the air. So make sure your feet
and legs barely break the surface.
Breathing: There should be a continuous exchange of air, whether
your head is above the water or below. Inhale fully and exhale slowly
and fully through both nose and mouth. Exhaling through the nose is
especially important when your face is underwater, since that’s what
keeps the water from getting in.
Another factor to bear in mind is the ratio of arm power to leg power.
Most people will be surprised by this comparison:
COMPARISON OF LEG AND ARM POWER

--- Page 146 Text ---
COMPARISON OF LEG AND ARM POWER
Percentage of Stroke’s Power from Kick Percentage of Stroke’s Power from Pull
Freestyle or crawl 20 80
Backstroke 25 75
Butterfly 30 70
Breaststroke 50 50
Sidestroke 50 50
These percentages are meant to give you an idea of what to strive
toward. Think of them as a goal that you’re constantly trying to achieve;
whether you do depends on your own relative strengths and weaknesses.
If you have an especially good kick, for instance, that will naturally
supply more power. And in competition the percentage varies, too:
sprinters use more leg power, and distance swimmers rely more on their
arms.
If you find these general ratios hard to believe, try this: just pull for
one lap; then just kick; finally, swim (use both arms and legs) for one
lap. Time yourself for each lap—then compare.

he crawl stroke is just about everyone’s favorite, whether they are
recreational or fitness swimmers, or competitive swimmers, who often
call it the freestyle. The words “crawl stroke” and “freestyle” are used
interchangeably. The crawl stroke is the easiest to learn for most people.
As your crawl stroke improves, you will be developing your “freestyle”
stroke techniques for faster and more efficient swimming.
The present-day crawl had its origins in Australia, around 1893. The
stroke supposedly got its name when a swimming coach, amazed at the
unusual stroke used by twelve-year-old Alick Wickham (and at the boy’s
resulting speed), exclaimed: “Look at that kid crawling!” Although this
original “Australian crawl” has been greatly refined over the past
century, the basic idea of combining a hand-over-hand arm motion with
a vertical kick and a prone body position was a remarkable improvement
over the strokes then in common use.
Word began to spread of the crawl’s speed and efficiency, and
gradually more and more competitive swimmers adopted the stroke for
speed swimming. It became supreme among all others for long-distance
swimming as well when Gertrude Ederle used it in her English Channel
swim in 1926. (“Doc” Counsilman used the freestyle in his 1979 Channel
swim, too-at the age of fifty-eight!) Since then, many swimmers have
contributed to the popularity and refinement of this all-purpose stroke,
including Esther Williams, Johnny Weissmuller, and Buster Crabbe, who
literally swam their way to fame and fortune. More recently Mark Spitz,
winner of seven Olympic gold medals in Munich in 1972, set four
Olympic records in freestyle sprint events. Since then, such swimmers as
Matt Biondi, Tracy Caulkins, Ambrose (“Rowdy”) Gaines, Janet Evans,
and Tom Jager have continued to shatter freestyle records.

EARNING THE REESTYLE
The basics of this stroke have already been taught in Part One, “The
Fundamentals of Swimming.” Here you’ll learn a few refinements to
your technique, including the more efficient S-pattern arm pull. This
technique is more powerful than the traditional straight-arm pull
because your hand moves a column of still water, instead of water that
you’ve already set in motion. This gives you a better “hold” on the water
and increases the resistance against your hand, enabling you to push
yourself forward with more force. The backstroke, breaststroke, and
butterfly also utilize an S-pattern pull, so once you understand the
principle you can transfer this technique to the other strokes as well.
Remember, the arms account for about four fifths of the forward
propulsion in the crawl stroke/freestyle. Actually, long-distance
swimmers use their legs even less, while competitive sprinters may get
more of their power from the kick.

The catch.

--- Page 149 Text ---
The pull (phase 1).
The pull (phase 2).
The recovery.
Body Position
Your body should have a long, stretched-out feeling. It should be
streamlined along its central axis (your spine), and the water level
should come between your eyebrows and your hairline.
Arm Motion
Practice the motion on dry land. Next, practice in shoulder-deep water,
walking forward at the speed at which you push water back. Then move
on to the arm drills.
THE CATCH

--- Page 150 Text ---
The stroke begins with the catch. Slice cleanly into the water, with your
elbow up and your hand and forearm entering the water at a 30-to 45-
degree angle. Keep your hand relaxed, thumb down, and palm facing
slightly diagonally outward. Then extend your arm into the water fully,
four to eight inches below the surface, before beginning the first phase
of the underwater pull. Throughout the stroke, keep your elbows higher
than your hands.
THE PULL
This part of the stroke makes an S shape for your left arm, a backward S
for your right arm. As the illustration shows, the S should be done so
that it is “bottom heavy.” For the best leverage, keep your elbow bent
slightly during the entire pull.
With your arm slightly bent, your hand pulls back, down, and out.
PHASE 1:
When it reaches just past shoulder width, pull in toward your stomach.
During this first part, feel as if you are gathering up an armload of water
and then pressing it back. This first phase should also give you a feeling
of leverage or lift.
From this position, press diagonally back toward your thigh.
PHASE 2:
Straighten and extend your arm as you accelerate the movement at the
end of the stroke; imagine that you’re throwing a ball behind you. The
speed of the pull is actually greatest here, at the end.

--- Page 151 Text ---
The S-shaped bent-arm pull for the crawl/freestyle.
THE RECOVERY
For the recovery, bend your elbow as you lift the arm out of the water.
Keep the elbow higher than the hand, and initially lead the swing
forward with the elbow. The fingers point back and trail behind for half
of the recovery. Midway, the fingers take over the lead, and the hand
enters the water at a 30-to 45-degree angle, thumb downward, for the
catch.
Body Roll
As one arm recovers, there’s a natural tendency for the body to roll 45
degrees or more toward the arm that’s pulling.
As the right arm pulls, the right shoulder rotates deeper into the
water, contributing further to the body roll. This body roll gives more
leverage to the pulling arm. It increases lift and streamlining on the
recovery side, because the shoulder, more above the water, encounters

--- Page 152 Text ---
less resistance.
As a result of body roll, you can think of your fingertips tracing a path
close to the center line of your body during phase 1 of the pull.
Leg Motion
The leg motion of the crawl stroke/freestyle is called the flutter kick.
Although this kick is technically known as the six-beat kick (i.e., three
kicks per arm motion), it’s more important that the kicks are rhythmic
and continuous than that you get exactly six per complete arm cycle.
Practice while sitting on the edge of the pool, then practice while
holding on to the pool wall, then with a kickboard. Try some of the kick
drills described below.
To flutter kick, move your legs up and down alternately. Keep your
legs close together, and keep the up-and-down span to about twelve to
eighteen inches. The action and power here come from the hip and
thigh, so keep your knees fairly straight, but not locked. Your ankles
should be loose and floppy; let them flex and point in an undulating or
almost whiplike movement as an extension of the flutter motion of your
legs. When used correctly, feet add power to your kick in the same way
that swim fins do. Your toes should almost point as your leg begins the
downward movement of the kick. Don’t splash—just make the water
“boil” for the most efficient kick. Kicking, when done correctly, helps
you to maintain your body position and the tempo of your stroke. Most
of the propulsion of the kick comes on the “downbeat.” In the freestyle,
the kick serves mainly to stabilize the stroke and to help keep your legs
from sinking too far below the surface. An inefficient kick, however, can
slow you down by creating resistance drag and making your arm pulls
less effective.
Many swimmers find that the legs naturally cross over slightly at the
ankle; there’s no harm in this. Another variation of this kick is called the
trudgeon, which is a scissors kick that occurs when the swimmer inhales.
If one of these kicks happens naturally and feels comfortable, by all
means go ahead and use it.

--- Page 153 Text ---
Breathing
Rhythmic breathing, the correct way to breathe while doing the
freestyle, consists of pivoting your face out of the water to inhale, then
pivoting it back down into the water to exhale. Remember, pivot your
head; don’t lift it.
Coordinating Arms and Breathing
Learn to breathe rhythmically and to coordinate the head action with
the arm motion. Follow the “Law of Opposites” as described in “The
Fundamentals of Swimming,” this page: as your head turns to inhale, the
arm on the opposite side extends and enters the water; at the same time,
the arm on your breathing side has completed the last part of the S
pattern. If you breathe on the right, for example, begin to turn your head
just as the fingers of your left hand enter the water. Inhale as your face
breaks the surface; exhale completely as it pivots back into the water.
You’ll probably prefer one side more than the other, but practice
breathing on both sides; eventually, you should try alternate breathing,
where you breathe first on one side, then, three arm strokes later, on the
opposite side. Ideally, you should be swimming efficiently enough for
your head to create a “wake,” or air pocket, that will allow you actually
to breathe with your mouth below the surface of the water. Finally,
remember to inhale and exhale continuously throughout rhythmic
breathing; don’t hold your breath at any time. The entire cycle should
take about three to five seconds.
Coordinating Arms and Legs
Many swimmers are comfortable doing a six-beat kick. This means
coordinating three downward kicks, or beats, per one arm pull, with the
downward kick of one leg coordinating with the catch of the opposite
arm.
Other swimmers develop a two-beat kick—one downward beat per
arm pull—because it’s less tiring when you ease up on the legs.
Sometimes they add a crossover, too.

--- Page 154 Text ---
There are several variations, but you should work out whichever
coordination works best for you—just remember, your goal is to move
smoothly and constantly through the water.
C B F
HECKLIST FOR A ETTER REESTYLE
Once you’ve gotten the basics, keep these pointers in mind to help you
swim more efficiently:
Keep your body position as stretched and streamlined as
possible, with your shoulders riding higher than your legs. (Feet
should be approximately one foot below the surface of the
water at the lowest point of the kick.)
Aim for a full arm extension (straight but not locked) at the
beginning and the end of each stroke.
Accelerate your stroke during phase 2 of the pull.
Keep your elbows higher than your hands at all times during
the stroke. Turning the thumb downward helps keep the elbow
up, in addition to cutting down on the amount of air entrapped
into the catch (remember, you want to push water, not air).
At the highest point of the recovery, your elbow is bent at a 90-
degree angle, with the wrist flexed slightly back. Initially the
elbow leads during the recovery, until the hand extends for the
catch.
Make sure that you take time for the catch of the stroke.
When inhaling, rotate your head just enough so that your
mouth clears the water. The less you turn, the better, so that
you get a clean, quick “bite” of air. Some swimmers actually
twist their mouths up toward their breathing side to minimize
head movement even further. When you breathe, you should be
looking diagonally toward the far end of the pool (not at the
bottom or at the ceiling, or behind you).
Don’t overkick; this will tire you out, and may even decrease

--- Page 155 Text ---
your speed. Just make the water “boil.” And try to keep your
ankles loose and supple to get a whipping action.

Advanced fitness and competitive swimmers may also use additional
resistance devices such as an inner tube and/or hand paddles.
: Even though these are arm drills, some may require kicking to
NOTE
maintain body position and smooth motion during the drill.
1. Catch-up Freestyle: To slow down the stroke and feel the S-pattern
pull.
As you do the arm motion, touch one thumb to the other before
beginning the next pull. Maintain a steady kick throughout the drill.
Practice this drill standing on land, then standing in shallow
water, then walking forward in shoulder-deep water.
Do one lap of catch-up; then swim normally for one lap.
Do half a lap of catch-up; then complete the lap by swimming.
Pull for four catch-up strokes; then complete the lap by
swimming.
(If you have a problem with the catch-up drills, do them while holding
on to the end of a kickboard with the nonpulling hand.)
2. One-arm Pulls: To even out the stroke, so both arms pull with the
same power. This drill may be done with or without kicking.
Pull with one arm at a time, keeping the nonpulling arm stretched out
in front of you.
Pull with the same arm for an entire lap, or alternate the

--- Page 156 Text ---
number of strokes done with each arm (i.e., eight right, eight
left). May be alternated in a descending/ascending progression
(8R, 8L; 4R, 4L; 2R, 2L; 1R, 1L; 2R, 2L; 4R, 4L; 8R, 8L).
3. Glide Freestyle: To get a better “feel” for the water with a deeper,
more efficient pull, and to allow for body roll. This drill may be done
with or without kicking.
Hold your hand in the catch position for as long as possible, and glide
in the water with the body roll; try to minimize kicking.
Pull for one lap doing the glide freestyle; then swim for one lap.
Pull for half a lap doing the glide freestyle; then complete the
lap by swimming.
Pull for four glide freestyle strokes, then complete the lap by
swimming.
4. DPS (Distance Per Stroke): To maximize the efficiency of each
stroke.
Count the strokes needed to complete a lap while pulling; on the next
lap, try to decrease the number of strokes needed. Try to do this for a
number of consecutive laps.
The glide freestyle drill works wonders for your DPS. Incorporate the
S-pattern pull to maximize your efficiency. As a goal, maintain the same
speed (watch the clock!) as you decrease the number of strokes on each
lap.
5. Fist Closed Pulling: To develop pulling power from the whole arm,
not just relying on the hands for propulsion.
Curl your fingers into a fist, placing the thumb over the middle
fingers. Keep elbows high through each armstroke.
6. Dig Freestyle: To practice lifting elbows high on the recovery.
Begin swimming one length of the pool with very short strokes;

--- Page 157 Text ---
where hands enter the water at your ears, elbows are high on
the recovery. Then gradually stretch out each successive stroke
so that the final strokes to the wall are “normal.”
7. Head-up Freestyle: To develop a high body position and proper
hand entries. Swim with your eyes above water; hold head in position
looking forward. The water line is at the bridge of your nose.

REESTYLE RILLS EGS
These drills may be done with or without fins or a kickboard. When kick
drills are done without a board, you will develop a “feel” for the water
with your hands. Because kick drills are done without using the arms—
which in the freestyle account for four fifths of the stroke’s power—they
give you a good chance to work your leg muscles more than you would
ordinarily.
1. Sit and Kick: To get the “feel” of the water with your feet.
Sit on the edge of the pool, feet dangling in the water, and practice the
flutter kick. Keep your ankles flexible and moving as you kick.
2. Wall Kick: To practice good kicking form and leg position.
Assume the bracket position (see this page), holding on to the edge of
the pool, with one hand grasping the edge and pulling outward, the
other dropped below the water surface and pushing against the wall for
leverage. Flutter kick in the prone position, with the power coming from
the hip, just making the water “boil.”
3. Free Kick: To strengthen the leg muscles; to practice good kicking
form with the body in proper swimming position. A kickboard is
optional.
With arms extended straight in front of you, flutter kick for several
laps. If you use a kickboard, you can either keep your head above water

--- Page 158 Text ---
and breathe normally, or you can practice your rhythmic breathing. If no
kickboard is used, take a rhythmic breath, when needed, by lowering the
arm on your breathing side and sculling during the inhalation.
4. Kick and Roll: To get a different feel for the water during kicking;
to practice the body roll. This drill should be done without a board.
Do the free-kick drill, and after every ten kicks rotate your body a
quarter turn, so that you first kick in a prone position. (Use your topmost
arm to scull whenever you need to inhale, and use the S-pattern
underwater pull to change positions.)
A variation of this drill is kicking on your side for a specified distance
(i.e., half a lap), then rotating onto the other side.
F D : B
REESTYLE RILLS REATHING
Breathing, the hardest part of the freestyle for many people, requires
both coordination and good breath control. The arm and leg drills can be
adapted to include breathing practice, as you will see.
1. Catch-up Freestyle: To prolong the stroke, giving you time to think
of the breathing and to coordinate it with the arm movement.
Practice the catch-up drill as described on this page, adding rhythmic
breathing.
2. Wall and Free Kick: To coordinate rhythmic breathing with flutter
kicking.
Do the wall and free-kick drills (this page), incorporating rhythmic
breathing. During the wall kick, inhale on the side of the underwater
arm. During the free kicking, hold the kickboard far enough away from
you to allow your head to rotate into and out of the water as you
practice your rhythmic breathing. Try adding the crawl-stroke arm
motion during both drills by alternately grasping and releasing the pool
wall or the kickboard between strokes.

--- Page 159 Text ---
3. Bilateral Breathing: To help balance the stroke; to streamline your
technique; to improve your breathing capacity.
Breathe every third stroke instead of every second stroke, so that you
turn your head to your accustomed breathing side for only every other
inhalation.
Practice this standing on land, then walking in shoulder-deep
water as you stroke.
Swim one lap breathing bilaterally; then swim normally for one
lap.
(This drill also gives you greater visibility as you swim—important in
a crowded pool, or in a race where you want to check out the
competition on both sides of you. Over long distances, alternate
breathing also gives your sternocleidomastoids an even break—these
neck muscles can become overworked if you continually turn your neck
to the same side. It gives your arm muscles on your nonbreathing side a
rest, too, since that arm tends to pull a bit harder during the inhalation.)
4. Controlled Breathing: To develop endurance and breathing
capacity; to enhance your ability to get a “second wind.”
Inhale on every other stroke cycle (every four strokes—
alternate breathing); then increase your breath control by
inhaling on every third cycle (six strokes).
Do bilateral breathing, increasing and decreasing the number of
strokes between breaths (i.e., inhale every third, fifth, seventh,
fifth, then third strokes).

ACKSTROKE
T
he backstroke is popular, largely because breathing poses no problem
—since you swim on your back, your nose and mouth stay above the
surface and you can breathe normally during the entire stroke cycle.
Many swimmers find that the supine position also allows for efficient leg
action, which helps compensate for the relative inefficiency of the angle
of the arm stroke. Of course, the disadvantage of the backstroke is that
when you’re on your back you can’t see where you’re going, only where
you’ve been.
The earliest backstrokers did a variation of the inverted breaststroke.
The elementary backstroke (taught in Part One), which uses the whip
kick, is similar to this old style. Since many people find this variation
relatively easy to master, it’s often used to introduce the more familiar
windmill backstroke.
The big hero of backstroke history is Harry Hebner, who introduced
the alternating arm pull during the 1912 Olympics. Since that time the
backstroke has undergone many subtler changes, too, including the
powerful and efficient bent-arm pull you’ll find here, which is similar to
the S-pattern pull in the freestyle. John Naber won his Olympic medals
in 1976 using these same techniques.
L B
EARNING THE ACKSTROKE
The backstroke is often called the back crawl—and that’s the easiest way
to visualize it: you lie on your back, your arms moving alternately and
rotating from the shoulder like a windmill, while your legs do an
inverted flutter kick. The backstroke used today incorporates a bent-arm
underwater pull, which is a refinement of the traditional but less

--- Page 165 Text ---
efficient straight-arm pull. In this stroke, the arms should supply about
three fourths of the forward propulsion, the legs one fourth.
“Where am I?” To keep from bumping your head on the pool wall,
count the number of strokes you need per lap the first time you swim it,
and for each lap thereafter. Or, to save counting, spot a landmark, such
as a ceiling mark, a ladder, or a depth indicator, and fix the number of
strokes to carry you from that point to the wall. (Most pools have flags
strung across them five yards from each end for just this purpose.) If
you’re not sure how close you are to the wall, leave one hand overhead
and “kick in” rather than overpull and risk bumping your head.
Body Position
Your body is in a supine position, with your legs stretched out straight.
Your head should be facing straight up, your chin should be tipped
slightly toward the chest, and your eyes should be looking diagonally
toward your feet. The water level should be at the middle of your head,
with your ears just submerged. Keep your back straight but not rigid.
Your hips should be as close to the water’s surface as possible, but lower
than your shoulders.

The pull (phase 1).
The pull (phase 2).
The recovery.
Arm Motion
As with the freestyle, each arm rotates alternately from the shoulder,
with one pulling underwater while the other returns to the starting

--- Page 167 Text ---
position by recovering upward out of the water. In the bent-arm pull the
arm bends in and down toward the legs at the beginning of the second
phase.
Practice the arm movement standing on land first, then standing in
shoulder-deep water, leaning backward to feel the stroke in the water;
then begin walking backward as the arm stroke propels you in that
direction.
THE CATCH
The backstroke arm motion begins with the catch, where the hand enters
the water at the top of the stroke. Keep your arm straight but not locked
at the elbow, and your hand in line with the shoulder. Slide your hand,
little finger first, down through the water like a knife, four to eight
inches below the surface, to get a good “hold” on the water.
THE PULL
Once you’ve gotten a hold on the water, begin the two-phase bent-arm
pull from the catch position.
1: Pull your arm backward and downward. As the pull continues,
PHASE
the elbow begins to bend and to move in toward the waist.
2: When your hand reaches shoulder level, continue to bend your
PHASE
elbow in and down toward your waist. Then pivot the forearm, pressing
“still” water straight down toward your feet, as if you were throwing a
ball behind you. During this last phase of the pull, accelerate your stroke
to provide as much power as possible, and end with your hand fully
extended below your leg. (This is similar to phase 2 of the freestyle,
where you pull under your stomach in order to push still water back
toward your feet.)

--- Page 168 Text ---
The bent-arm pull for the backstroke.
THE RECOVERY
Lift your arm (thumbs up) and brush your hand past your outer thigh to
begin the recovery. Continue the upward motion with the arm extended
but relaxed, and swing it straight up and overhead in a semicircle. At
this point, your thumb position should be whatever is most comfortable
for you; the recovery should give your hand, arms, and shoulder muscles
a chance to relax. Enter with the pinky down for the catch, to begin the
stroke again.
Body Roll
As your arms move, your body will tend to roll through the water. This
rotation should occur smoothly and naturally around a central axis—
your spinal column. As your right arm enters the water, your right
shoulder follows and dips down at an angle of about 45 degrees to the
water line; your left shoulder simultaneously rotates up 45 degrees from
the water line. As your right arm pulls, your shoulders return to the
normal horizontal position; then you roll to the left as your left arms
enters the water. The roll originates in the shoulders and chest and
travels down the body to the hips. (The head stays straight during the
roll.) Body roll helps your stroke efficiency by allowing the pulling arm
to pull deeper (and so to press continuously against new water), and by
cutting down on the resistance meeting your recovery arm (since that
shoulder is now out of the water).

--- Page 169 Text ---
Leg Motion
The backstroke uses the flutter kick, with legs close together and moving
up and down alternately, similar to the action in the crawl. The kick is
more important in the backstroke than in the crawl, however, because of
the supine body position—much of your below-the-waist weight is
beneath the water line. The flutter kick also serves to stabilize the body
position during the shoulder roll. Practice flutter kicking while sitting on
a chair, sofa, or pool deck. Make sure that the kick originates in the hip
and thigh. Then practice while holding on to the pool wall or steps, and
finally progress to free kicking (see the drills that follow).
To do the flutter kick, move your legs up and down alternately, as if
you were walking. Keep your legs close together and kick twelve to
eighteen inches deep. The action emanates from your hip and thigh;
your knees should stay loose and flexible. The knee actually bends
slightly on the upbeat of the kick, supplying more of its energy there,
then straightens on the downbeat. The feet should flex and bend easily
at the ankle in a whipping action to add to the propulsion. Keep your
feet just below the surface of the water when you kick and just make the
water foam or boil.
Breathing
Since your face stays above the water throughout, breathing during the
backstroke is simply a matter of keeping a steady rhythm for both
inhalation and exhalation, usually with one breath cycle per arm cycle.
Be certain not to breathe too fast or too shallowly.
Coordinating Arms and Legs
The usual is a six-beat kick: six kicks per arm cycle, or three kicks per
arm stroke. Variations on the six-beat kick, such as the four-beat or two-
beat kick, are very rare in the backstroke. Again, though, you should just
aim for a consistent rhythm and not worry too much about actually
counting your beats.

HECKLIST FOR A ETTER ACKSTROKE
After you have the basics of the backstroke, keep these pointers in mind
as you practice.
Keep your back straight and your head still throughout the
stroke. If you tend to “sit” in the water, arch your back upward
slightly and look at the ceiling.
Tighten the buttocks but relax the waist.
Keep your arms working continuously and in opposition to each
other. There’s no glide in this stroke—as one hand enters the
water above your head, the other is emerging at your hip.
Slice your hand cleanly into the water, pinky first, for the catch.
Let the body roll naturally during phase 1 of the pull.
As you bring your elbow close to the waist and complete phase
2 (the “ball-throwing” phase) of the pull, come close to the
surface of the water, but be careful not to break it. Remember,
you don’t get anywhere by pushing air.
During the recovery, keep your arm fully extended but not
tense, with the wrist relaxed; imagine that your shoulder is
leading the action.
Accentuate the upbeat on the kick.
Keep your legs underwater throughout the kick, which is a
rapid but relaxed action. Although the knees bend slightly,
make sure that the power comes from the hip and drives
whiplike down through the leg and toward the feet. The idea is
to propel a column of water backward.
The kick accounts for one quarter of the power of this stroke,
but don’t overkick—just make the water “boil.”

These drills may be done with or without a pull-buoy for support. You
might also like to try the new smaller hand paddles made especially for
the backstroke, in order to provide additional resistance and a better
“feel” for the water; inner tubes supply extra resistance for the more
advanced swimmer, too (see this page).
: Even though these are arm drills, some may require kicking to
NOTE
maintain body position and smooth motion.
1. Catch-up Backstroke: To slow down the stroke in order to
articulate the bent-arm pull.
Begin by flutter kicking in the supine position with your arms
extended overhead. Do the bent-arm pull with each arm alternately,
S
touching one to the other at the catch position before beginning the next
stroke.
Practice while standing on land, then while standing in shallow
water, then while walking backward in shoulder-deep water.
Pull for one lap doing the catch-up; then swim for one lap.
Do half a lap catch-up; then complete the lap by swimming.
Pull for four catch-up strokes; then complete the lap by
swimming.
(If you have trouble keeping your lower body up during this drill, kick
slightly, or use a pull-buoy to support you, or alter the drill by extending
your arms along your sides during the catch-up (so that your arms don’t
touch, and you begin the stroke with the recovery instead of the catch).
2. One-arm Pulls: To even out the stroke; to develop shoulder roll; to
isolate the bent-arm S pull with each arm. This drill may be done with or
without kicking.
Pull with one arm at a time, keeping the nonpulling arm stretched out
in the catch position.

--- Page 172 Text ---
Pull with one arm per lap, or alternate the number of strokes
done with each arm (for instance, pull eight times on the right,
then eight times on the left). Or alternate in a
descending/ascending progression: 8R, 8L; 4R, 4L; 2R, 2L; 1R,
1L; then 2R, 2L; 4R, 4L; 8R, 8L.
A practice variation is to swim close enough to hug the side wall of the
pool in order to develop your sense of proper hand position during the
bent-arm pull. Another variation is to do this drill with the nonpulling
arm held at your side.
3. Glide Backstroke: To get a better “feel” for the water; to slow down
the stroke in order to concentrate on stroke details; to practice body roll,
and to accentuate phase 2 of the pull. This drill may be done with or
without kicking.
Move both arms alternately but, at each extension of the pull, hold the
hand in the overhead catch position for as long as possible, and glide in
the water, feeling the body roll.
Pull or swim for one lap doing the glide backstroke; then swim
the regular backstroke for one lap.
Pull or swim for half a lap doing the glide backstroke; then
complete the lap by swimming.
Pull for four glide backstrokes; then complete the lap by
swimming.
: This is a drill only; when doing the backstroke, a glide is
NOTE
undesirable—aim for a constant motion with your arms.)
4. DPS (Distance Per Stroke): To increase the efficiency of each
stroke.
Count the strokes needed to complete one lap while pulling only. On
successive laps, try to lower the number of strokes needed.
Incorporate the glide backstage to slow down your stroke, and take
time to exert more pressure during the bent-arm pull in order to push

more still water back.
5. Double-arm Backstroke: To get a feel for the bent-arm pull by
doing it with both arms simultaneously.
Do the backstroke, pulling with both arms together, and pausing at the
catch to glide.
Pull one lap of the double-arm backstroke; then swim one lap of
regular backstroke.
Use the whip kick (or frog kick) (See “Breaststroke,” this page)
while pulling.
Use the dolphin kick (see “Butterfly Stroke,” this page) while
pulling.
(This drill can also be used as a stroke variation. Some swimmers find it
easier than the alternating-arm windmill backstroke, or useful as a
preliminary step in learning the windmill. Since you can’t utilize the
body roll here, the pull is shallower than in the regular backstroke.)

ACKSTROKE RILLS EGS
Do these drills with or without fins; fins help your ankle flexibility,
which is very important in the backstroke kick. You may need to hold on
to a kickboard or to support your head with a pull-buoy, but most people
will find these unnecessary. Kick drills, done with no arm motion,
improve the technique of your kick and strengthen the leg muscles—
important in this stroke, since your body position depends on a good
kick.
1. Sit and Kick: To get a “feel” for the water by keeping your ankles
as loose as possible while kicking from the hip and thigh.
Flutter kick while sitting on the edge of the pool, on steps in the
shallow water, or on a ladder rung.

--- Page 174 Text ---
2. Wall Kick: To practice supine kicking and to get a feel for proper
body position.
With both hands, hold on to the edge of the pool, the steps in the
shallow end, or a ladder. Get comfortable (the corner is the best wall
position). Flutter kick in the supine position, trying to make the water
just “boil,” and kicking from the thigh and hip.
3. Free Kick: To practice good flutter kicking form and body position.
Flutter kick on your back with both arms extended overhead and
pressed close to your ears, and with your palms touching. Keep your
body as stretched and streamlined as possible, and your head stationary
in line with your body. (If you need to at first, place a kickboard above
your stomach, holding the edges lightly, as if you were playing a piano.)
4. Kick and Roll: To get a feel for the water in different positions; to
practice body roll. (May also serve as a preliminary step in coordinating
the arm and leg motions.)
Do the free-kick drill, rotating your body a quarter turn after every ten
kicks. Begin in the supine position, then turn onto one side, then onto
your back again, then onto the other side, and onto your back once
more. Use the bent-arm pull to rotate your body and a sculling motion to
raise your head when you need to inhale while you’re on your side.
5. Supine Half-turns: To obtain a higher shoulder recovery; to balance
body roll; to increase DPS.
Do the free-kick drill with one arm extended overhead in the catch
position, the other down at your side with the shoulder raised as during
the body roll.
Kick whole laps, alternating the extended arm for each lap.
Kick six beats, alternating arms for each set of kicks. (Change
arms mid-lap by doing the bent-arm pull with the extended arm
and recovering with the other.)
Change arms after every three kicks. (This can also be a

n its commonly used form, the breaststroke would probably win a
worldwide popularity contest, thanks to its most outstanding
characteristic—a relatively long, restful glide. The stroke’s two other
attractions are the natural way that the breathing coordinates with the
lift of the head and shoulders, and its excellent visibility. All in all, this
is an easy and relaxing stroke when swum slowly.
For the fitness swimmer, the breaststroke is more than a good way to
vary the strenuousness and pace of a workout. It’s also one of the biggest
favors you can do for your inner and outer thighs as well as your inner
and upper arms—areas that stubbornly resist toning and trimming
during most other forms of exercise. And they don’t call it the
breaststroke for nothing—the arm motions give your pectorals (the
muscles that help support and shape the chest area) a real workout, too.
The breaststroke, by the way, is also ideal for swimming in rough water,
a busy pool, or water rescues.
Historically, the breaststroke is perhaps the oldest stroke. For many
centuries it was the stroke that swimmers learned. It’s long been a
favorite for recreational and practical purposes, too, especially in
Europe. The breaststroke was also the first stroke to be used in
competition. Now it’s the slowest of the competitive strokes, because of
the resistance encountered by the underwater recovery of the arms and
legs. But it’s still the preferred stroke of many, and actually becomes
quite strenuous and surprisingly fast when swum at the competitive
level. Anita Nall and Mike Barrowman, 1992 Olympic breaststroke
champions and record holders, have demonstrated how powerful and
fast this stroke can be swum, using recently developed techniques.
L B
EARNING THE REASTSTROKE

--- Page 178 Text ---
The conventional breaststroke, which had been around for hundreds of
years pretty much unchanged, has recently undergone major revisions.
These exciting, speed-inducing innovations have naturally been adopted
by successful record-breaking swimmers, but they also make the stroke
more effective for swimmers on virtually every level.
The most substantial change has been in the kick. Originally, almost
everyone did a wide frog kick, in which the knees lead as they bend and
the legs simultaneously sweep outward in a broad curve and finish by
squeezing together while fully extended. Now the newer, narrower, and
more efficient whip kick is recommended; in this kick much of the
propulsion comes from the calf and foot. The arm stroke has also been
improved—from an upside-down heart-shaped pull that allows one to
press “still” water backward, to using a sculling motion for greater
propulsion.
In the breaststroke, the leg motion ideally supplies 50 percent of the
forward propulsion. However, if you have a strong whip kick, by all
means take advantage of it and allow your legs to supply more than half
the power. In the breaststroke, unlike in the freestyle, backstroke, or
butterfly, you can’t really overkick.
Body Position
As you’ll see later, the hips and body (and sometimes the shoulders,
too) undulate slightly during the course of the stroke cycle, but basically
your body is in a prone, face-downward, streamlined position. At the
beginning of the stroke, your arms should be extended straight out in
front of you with hands together, palms down, thumbs slanted slightly
downward, angled about four to eight inches below the surface. Your
legs should be extended with your hips and feet just underwater.
Arm Motion
In the breaststroke, the arms move simultaneously and symmetrically
underwater throughout the entire stroke, beginning with arms extended
overhead. Both arms moving together trace the outline of an upside-

--- Page 179 Text ---
down heart shape during the pull: a smooth, outward, and downward
pull in phase 1, and an accelerated, inward sculling movement in phase
2. Then both arms extend overhead and straight underwater for the
recovery.
The breaststroke.
The catch.
The pull (phase 1).
The pull (phase 2).

--- Page 180 Text ---
The recovery.
Practice just the arm motion, then add coordinated breathing as
described later. Work in shoulder-deep water, first just standing, then
walking forward as the arm motion propels you through the water. To
learn sculling, review the sculling arm motion for treading on this
page–this page.
THE CATCH
Start and end each stroke cycle by reaching with your arms completely
extended overhead and legs straight in a streamlined body position. The
catch begins at the top of the upside-down heart with the hands
approximately shoulder width apart. Turn your hands so that your palms
face outward with thumbs pointing downward. You should feel your
hands getting a “hold” on the water.
THE PULL
This is the power part of the arm motion. To get the most leverage, keep
your elbows higher than your hands throughout.

--- Page 181 Text ---
The heart-shaped pull for the breaststroke.
After the catch, pull by moving your arms diagonally outward,
PHASE 1:
keeping elbows slightly bent. This pull ends approximately at the
shoulders.
2: Turn your hands inward with thumbs pointing up, bring your
PHASE
forearms inward under your chest, then squeeze your elbows together,
completing the bottom of the heart shape. This motion creates a high
upper-body position. Your shoulders and head rise up here to allow you
to take a breath.
THE RECOVERY
This should be a smooth, natural motion that blends imperceptibly with
the end of the pull. With your hands four to eight inches underwater,

--- Page 182 Text ---
elbows close to your body, and your arms as parallel to the surface as
possible, quickly bring your arms forward into a streamlined position.
You can recover your hands with palms together, in a prayer position; or
palms up, with little fingers touching; or overlapping, palms either up or
down. Use whatever is most comfortable for you. Since this is the
recovery, not the power phase of the stroke, the important thing is to
keep your arms relaxed to give them a short rest, and to get the hands
into a palms-down position as quickly as possible to help streamline your
body. During the recovery, your head and shoulders will drop back
down in the water to their starting position; as your arms extend fully,
you’ll be ready for the catch, which begins the next stroke.
Refined Breaststroke Arm Motion
For the competitive breaststroker, the arm pull is often described as a
sculling action. At the catch, the arms scull outward, followed by an
inward scull. Propulsion is obtained equally from both the outward and
the inward scull.
Recovery for some swimmers occurs with hands actually breaking the
surface of the water. To achieve this type of recovery, head and
shoulders must ride high in the water.
To help perfect this motion, practice sculling drills, such as vertical
treading.
Leg Motion
There are two basic leg motions—the frog and whip kicks—that are used
when swimming breaststroke. Unlike the flutter kick, these leg motions
are simultaneous and symmetrical.
The propulsion from the traditional frog kick comes from the legs
sweeping outward and then squeezing together to compress the water.
This is basically the same principle that oars use to propel a rowboat.
The whip kick, on the other hand, is more like the propeller action that
drives a motorboat. It results in a more direct application of backward
force, in a faster tempo, and in a more streamlined overall stroke.
However, the whip kick requires more flexibility in the knees, ankles,

--- Page 183 Text ---
and feet, and may place more of a stress on your knees. (See Swimmers’
Shape-ups, this page.) You might begin with a modified whip kick, in
which you separate your knees only slightly beyond the hip width. Then
you can gradually work up to the narrow whip described above.
Whatever variation of the kick you do, use how your knees feel as an
indicator of your kick.
Practice on dry land by lying face down on a bench, or by sitting in a
chair (brace yourself with your arms). Next, kick while holding on to the
edge of the pool or a step; finally, progress to the kick drills below.
Whip Kick: In the whip kick, with legs extended and together, begin
by bringing your heels together up close to your buttocks. Bend your
hips as little as possible. Allow your knees to separate to no more than
hip width as you rotate your feet outward. Your feet are flexed at this
point, and your lower legs form a V. Immediately “whip” your lower legs
down, around, and together in an outward and backward semicircle,
straightening your knees and pointing your feet during the accelerated
snap. This circular, backward motion—with the sole, instep, and calf—
presses almost directly back on the water and is the main propulsive
force behind the kick. Even though they don’t seem to move very much,
the power actually comes mainly from the hip and thigh muscles. The
kick ends with the legs fully extended and pressed together, toes pointed
for maximum streamlining.
Frog Kick: In the traditional frog kick, you begin by separating your
knees wider than your hips and bringing them to your chest, so that your
legs make a diamond shape. Then you straighten your legs, spread them
wide apart, and stretch your feet out to the sides, forming a wide V.
Then you squeeze your legs together to complete the kick, extending
your legs completely and pointing your toes for a streamlined position.
Breathing
Inhale when the head and shoulders rise together during the sculling
phase of the pull. Exhale as your face submerges during the recovery.

--- Page 184 Text ---
Ideally, your head should remain still in relation to the rest of your
body. Try to have the sensation that your head is motionless and that the
water is rising and falling around it. Be careful not to nod your head.
Coordinating Arms, Legs, and Breathing
Although there is some overlap, the basic sequence is: “pull (inhale),
kick, and glide.” Bend your knees to begin the kick when the arms are
just finishing the pull and are under your chest. As your arms are
beginning the recovery, your knees are bent to their fullest. Then both
arms and legs move simultaneously to finish the stroke, with everything
fully extended and streamlined for the catch, during which your body
should be rail straight and gliding. Note that your legs remain in the
streamlined position a bit longer than your arms do, since the kick
begins only after your arms are well into the pull.
C B B
HECKLIST FOR A ETTER REASTSTROKE
As you practice, remember these tips:
Keep your head still, with your chin jutting out slightly.
For the catch, keep your elbows straight with your hands facing
outward; your thumbs are pointing down.
The outward pull goes only to shoulder height.
Inhale quickly when your head and shoulder rise naturally as a
result of the inward scull. Try not to lift your head any farther
than you have to.
Begin the whip kick as your arms start the pull.
Aim for a narrow kick—when your heels come up toward the
buttocks, the knees, ideally, should be no farther than hip width
apart. But modify the kick according to your comfort and
ability.
Snap your lower legs and feet together in a downward arc to

--- Page 185 Text ---
get a whiplike action that propels water directly backward.
Be as streamlined and extended as possible during the glide,
and hold it for as long as your momentum will allow.
Try downstreaming, a technique used in competitive swimming
to gain more speed. Here’s how its done: at the end of the kick
and the beginning of the glide, squeeze arms covering ears, lift
the hips, legs, and feet up to the surface of the water so that
they are higher than the hands. This creates a “downstream
position”—almost as if you were swimming downhill. Since this
follows the rise and fall of the torso during the pull, you move
in a wavelike motion, which gets your hips higher and your
entire body involved in the stroke. (This is similar to the
undulation found in the butterfly stroke, in which your body is
alternately piked and arched.)
Remember your coordination: pull (inhale), kick, and glide.

1. Vertical Treading: Stand in chin-deep water and review sculling
arm motion for treading. Create a figure 8 with each arm
simultaneously, keeping arms at chest level (see treading, this page).
Scull outward with thumbs down and scull inward with thumbs up.
Bend your knees to keep your feet off the bottom and support your body

These drills may be done with or without a kickboard; you’ll obtain
better body position without one. During the drills, do the frog, whip, or
modified whip kick, whichever you prefer, unless specified otherwise. In
kick drills, only the legs are used; this allows you to improve your leg
strength and to concentrate on your kicking mechanics.
1. Sit and Kick: To get a “feel” for the kick.
Sit on the pool deck, a step, or a ladder rung, your legs extended to
the water’s edge. Do the frog kick or whip kick, analyzing your form.
Pay particular attention to the position of the feet during the whip, as
this is the trickiest part of the action to master.
2. Wall Kick: To practice good kicking form.
In supine position: Hold on to the wall with your back toward it, your
arms extended to either side. Practice kicking, paying close attention to
your form.
In prone position: Facing the pool edge, grasp the gutter with one hand
and press the other hand flat against the wall, fingers pointed
downward, approximately two feet below the water line. Practice your

kick, being careful not to break the surface.
3. Free Kick: To practice kicking form; to increase the power of the
kick; to get the feel of correct body position.
In prone position: Extend your arms straight in front of you, with or
without a kickboard, and kick several laps. If you use a kickboard, either
keep your head above water and breathe normally or coordinate the
inhalation and exhalation with the kick. If no kickboard is used, scull
outward with your hands to raise your shoulders and head when you
need to inhale.
In supine position: Support yourself by holding a kickboard over the
abdomen, your fingers resting lightly on the sides. Kick several laps.
4. Prone and Supine Heel Touch: To develop flexibility and power in
your whip kick; to balance and narrow the stroke.
Do the whip kick with your hands resting on your buttocks, trying to
touch your heels to your hands. Inhale as your knees come up to your
hands.
5. Vertical Kick: To strengthen the kick.
With arms motionless in the water or above the surface (the higher the

Because of the nature of this stroke, the coordination of the arm and leg
motions affects the body’s position in the water. The drills that include
the dolphin kick help you to get the feel of the wavelike action called
downstreaming, where the hips and legs lift up.

--- Page 188 Text ---
1. Pull with Dolphin Kick: To get a wavelike action in the body
(downstreaming).
Alternate one breaststroke pull, then one dolphin kick for an entire
lap. Swim the next lap with the regular breaststroke, using the whip or
frog kick, and trying to incorporate the wavelike action into your stroke.
2. Double-arm Backstroke with Kick: To coordinate the kick with a
double arm motion without rhythmic breathing.
For the first lap, do the double-arm backstroke (both arms pulling
together) with the whip or frog kick. For the next lap, swim the regular
breaststroke.
3. Pull-Pull-Kick or Pull-Kick-Kick: For variety; to help you get a feel
for the undulating body motion; to concentrate on the pull.
Alternate two arm pulls with one whip kick or frog kick for one
lap; then swim the next lap normally.
Alternate one arm pull with two whip kicks or frog kicks for
one lap; then swim the next lap normally.
Do one arm pull, then one whip kick, then one dolphin kick,
and so on, for one lap; then swim the next lap normally.
Another variation is to alternate one pull with two whip kicks
followed by two dolphin kicks.
4. Push-off: To check streamlining; to slow down the parts of the
stroke in order to feel each one better.
Push off the wall of the pool underwater and see how far you can go

UTTERFLY STROKE
T
he butterfly can be the most exciting and graceful stroke to swim and
to watch: where else can you find such sinuous, flowing movement
combined with an exhilarating sense of power? Although the “fly” is
usually considered the most difficult stroke to master, you can actually
learn it fairly easily by applying the basic S pull used in the crawl or
freestyle. There’s no denying that the butterfly is a strenuous stroke,
though—even well-trained “fliers” stick to swims of a relatively short
distance. (You’ll notice that when it’s introduced in the workouts you
rarely swim the butterfly continuously for more than twenty-five yards
or meters, whereas you do many times that distance for every other
stroke.)
The butterfly has much in common with the breaststroke, from which
it is derived, in that both arms and legs move simultaneously and
symmetrically. But swimmers and coaches had long realized that the
resistance caused by the underwater arm recovery of the breaststroke
slowed the stroke down. In 1933 Henry Meyer had the idea of trying an
over-the-water recovery. The resulting hybrid stroke was still within the
rules for competitive breaststroke swimming, but a new and superior
stroke was born with the substitution of the dolphin kick for the whip or
frog kick. In 1952 the “butterfly,” as the new stroke was called, was
accepted as an official competitive stroke, and by 1956 it was a part of
the Olympics. Mark Spitz, winner of seven Olympic golds in 1972,
brought the “fly” into the limelight, as did 1988/1992 Olympic
Champion Matt Biondi and 1992 Olympic wonder Pablo Morales.
During its short life, the butterfly hasn’t undergone quite as many
refinements as the other, older strokes have. Back in the early days, the
frog kick was used; in fact, some people still prefer it, especially when
first learning the stroke. But because this kick makes for a rather uneven

--- Page 193 Text ---
overall stroke, eventually swimmers developed the fishtail, or dolphin
kick, which is now required in all but Masters competition. The new
kick, used in conjunction with the S-pattern underwater pull that has
done so much for the other strokes, makes the butterfly very fast, and its
popularity has soared.
L B
EARNING THE UTTERFLY
Yes, the butterfly has earned the reputation of being “the hard stroke.”
And it is true that many swimmers experience frustration when first
learning it—even those who eventually learn it well enough to do it in
competition. But there must be some reason why so many people keep
trying until they get it right. And the butterfly isn’t really all that
difficult once you’ve learned the basic mechanics and can relax and get
into the rhythm of it. If you keep at it, the day will come when you find
yourself doing the “fly.”
The “fly” requires a different kind of stamina than the other strokes,
which makes it a superb cardiovascular conditioner. That’s because
there’s none of the alternating motion of the freestyle or backstroke, in
which one arm rests during the recovery while the other works during
the pull phase. You also need more overall flexibility for the butterfly,
especially in the shoulders, hips, ankles, and feet, as well as greater
upper-body strength. So weight training and stretches (see “Swimmers’
Shape-ups,” this page) are definite aids to learning and practicing the
“fly.”
The butterly shares with the breaststroke the simultaneous underwater
pull. In addition, the kick, which usually accounts for 30 percent of the
stroke’s power, helps to set up an undulating, dolphinlike motion
through the body that resembles in part the downstreaming used in the
breaststroke. The butterfly has so much in common with the
breaststroke, in fact, that it may be wise to master the breaststroke as a
preliminary to learning the “fly.” (And once you’ve mastered the
butterfly, you’ll be rewarded with a better breaststroke!)
Another general tip when training in the butterfly is to stick to
distances that allow you to maintain a semblance of the stroke. When
your stroke begins to deteriorate, it’s a sure sign that you should go on

--- Page 194 Text ---
to something else.

--- Page 195 Text ---
Body Position
In the butterfly, as in the breaststroke, your body sets up a wavelike
motion that adds grace and efficiency to the stroke. In general, your
body swims in a streamlined, prone position, with arms and legs
extended at the beginning of each stroke cycle. You should be looking
forward slightly, with the water about even with your eyebrows (except
during inhalation). Your shoulders should be high above the water and
parallel to the surface. Hips are generally high in the water. (Women, by
the way, tend to find this part easier because of their anatomy.)
Arm Motion
The arms move simultaneously and evenly in a mirror image of each
other, with each arm moving underwater in an S-shaped pattern.
Since the arms move simultaneously, however, the stroke resembles an
hourglass or keyhole. Also, since there’s no side-to-side body roll, the
underwater pull is shallower and the overwater recovery is wider and
lower. As in the other strokes, keep your elbows higher than your hands
to get the best leverage.
Practice the arm stroke on land, then in shoulder-deep water (first just
standing, then walking); next, when the arm motion alone is
comfortable, begin to work on coordinating it with the breathing.
THE CATCH
Hands enter the water together, shoulder width apart: your elbows are
up and your thumbs are down, as in the crawl/freestyle. Slide your
hands forward, outward, and downward at a 30-to 45-degree angle from
the water’s surface, to a depth of four to eight inches. This is the “catch,”
during which you should get a good “hold” on the water. You have only
a moment to do this, because of the timing of the kick.
THE PULL

--- Page 196 Text ---
1: Pull out, down, and back with both arms simultaneously, bending
PHASE
your elbows slightly and rotating your arms from the shoulders. End this
phase with your forearms vertical and palms facing back toward your
feet, no wider than shoulder width apart. This completes the top of the
keyhole or hourglass shape.
The keyhole-shaped pull for the butterfly stroke.
2: This is the acceleration phase of the pull. Begin by bringing your
PHASE
hands together under your abdomen so that your elbows bend at about
90 degrees; then press outward and back toward your feet, as for the
crawl stroke, accelerating the movement begun in phase 1. Continue
pressing water directly backward, until your arms are almost fully
extended and your hands are just past your hips. (This will begin to raise
your shoulders out of the water and is the time to inhale, as described
later.)
THE RECOVERY

--- Page 197 Text ---
As your hands emerge from the water, swing them around to the sides
and front. The elbows are higher than the hands, and the arms are
rounded, with the fingertips skimming just above the surface. At the
start of the recovery, your hands trail behind, and your elbows lead the
swing; about halfway, the hands take over the lead as the forearms
extend in front of you just prior to the catch. During the initial part of
the recovery, your arms should be relaxed, but they should move
quickly, using the power generated by your upper back and shoulders
during the acceleration phase of the pull. Then the momentum continues
to carry your arms forward, to begin the catch again. Your shoulders are
higher in the water during the recovery than at any other point; as the
hands come forward, the shoulders return to their lower position. This
shoulder undulation contributes to, and coordinates with, the wavelike
motion of the hips and legs.
Leg Motion
The dolphin kick accounts for about 30 percent of the power of the
overall stroke and must be carefully coordinated with the arm motion,
the breathing, and the wavelike body motion.
The aim of the dolphin kick is to push a column of “still” water
backward quickly and forcefully. It’s a two-beat kick, with both legs
moving up and down together twice, during the course of one arm cycle.
It’s similar to the flutter kick except that your knees and hips bend a bit
more, and of course, both legs move in unison. Bring your hips up
during the downbeat so that your buttocks just break the surface, and
bring them down during the upbeat—this results in a sinuous,
undulating motion that adds to your forward power by getting your
whole body, not just your limbs, involved in the stroke.
On the downbeat of the kick, the feet should be pointed to help them
direct the water backward, not downward, and to continue the
undulation that began in your hips. On the upbeat, your feet should just
break the surface. Practice while sitting on a chair on dry land, then
proceed to the kick drills described later.

--- Page 198 Text ---
Breathing
For maximum streamlining and efficiency, the ideal breathing pattern is
to inhale on every other stroke (alternate breathing). However, because
of the intense, explosive action of the butterfly, you may find that this is
not enough. So establish and stay with a breathing pattern that is
comfortable for you, This might be a breath on every stroke, or you
might alternate a single breath with a double breath—i.e., stroke, stroke
(breathe); stroke (breathe); stroke, stroke (breathe); and so on.
Practice coordinating the breathing with the arm motion, first on land,
then while standing in shoulder-deep water, and finally during the drills
that follow.
Inhale at the end of phase 2 of the arm pull, just as the arms are
beginning to recover and your shoulders are at their highest. Extend
your chin slightly forward—just enough to get your mouth out of the
water. As you lift, look forward and take a big bite of air. Then lower
your head immediately to restore the streamlined body position. (Some
people prefer to turn the head to one side during the inhalation because
in this position the “bow wave” from the head allows them to get a
breath while keeping the cheek closer to the water.)
Coordinating Arms, Legs, and Breathing
The common kick cycle is two beats per arm stroke. The downbeat of the
first kick begins when your hands are shoulder width apart and have
entered the water for the catch. This kick is completed during phase 1 of
the pull and is followed by a quick upbeat when your arms are between
phase 1 and phase 2, at the narrowest point of the keyhole or S. Then
the downbeat of the second kick synchronizes with the explosive finish
of phase 2 of the arm motion. There is a second, relaxed upbeat kick
during the arm recovery of the stroke.
To coordinate breathing, begin inhaling at the completion of your arm
stroke, so that your mouth clears the water as your arms recover.
To coordinate your entire stroke, swim in the following sequence:
catch and kick, pull and kick, inhale and recover. Most simply, this
coordination can be thought of as a downbeat kick at the beginning and

--- Page 199 Text ---
at the end of each arm stroke, with inhalation taking place at the start of
the recovery. Use the drills that follow to help you get the timing.
C B B S
HECKLIST FOR A ETTER UTTERFLY TROKE
Hands enter thumb first at a 30-to 45-degree angle from the
water surface; it’s essential to “grab hold” of the water
immediately at the “catch” of the stroke.
At entry, hands should be approximately shoulder width apart;
elbows are bent and higher than the hands.
During phase 1 of the pull, your hands should pull shoulder
width apart, outward and downward. The phase finishes with
your forearms in a vertical position.
During phase 2, accelerate the pull, pushing water backward
toward your feet.
The ideal breathing pattern is one inhalation every other arm
stroke, but adapt this to your own needs; inhale when your
shoulders are highest, at the end of phase 2 of the pull; raise
your head just high enough for your mouth to clear the water.
Economize on the recovery—your arms should barely clear the
water. Keep the arms relaxed, elbows turned slightly upward.
The ideal kick cycle is two beats per arm stroke. The first kick
occurs during the “catch” and phase 1 of the arm pull; the
second kick occurs during phase 2 of the arm pull.
Get a whipping action by pointing your toes during the
downbeat. Relax your feet during the upbeat of the kick.
To coordinate the stroke elements, remember: catch and kick,
pull and kick, inhale and recover.

UTTERFLY RILLS RMS

These drills may be done with or without pull-buoys for support. To
build upper body strength during the arm drills, the more advanced
swimmer can use resistance devices such as an inner tube, or “donut,”
around the ankles, or pull-buoys between the ankles.
1. Progressive Pulling: To first learn the keyhole arm pull without
becoming fatigued by the overwater recovery; to gradually develop
strength and flexibility in order to do the overwater recovery.
Practice the butterfly arm pull, but recover arms under the water, as
in the breaststroke. See how far you can glide after each pull—the
greater the distance, the more efficient your stroke.
When this drill is comfortable and your pull is strong, switch to the
overwater recovery, breathing whenever necessary; practice first while
standing, then while walking, in shoulder-deep water.
Do two butterfly pulls with the overwater recovery; then
complete the lap using the underwater recovery. Continue
practicing, trying to use the overwater recovery for longer and
longer distances.
Another variation is to alternate four pulls with overwater
recovery and four pulls with underwater recovery.
2. Free-fly Pull: To keep pull balanced on both sides; to practice
coordination of stroke and breathing; to experiment with your own
breathing pattern and stroke coordination.
Alternate keyhole butterfly pull with catch-up freestyle pull (see this
page).
Variation 1—two butterfly pulls
one catch-up freestyle pull—right arm

one catch-up freestyle pull—left arm
and so on
Variation 2—one butterfly pull

Make up your own variations. But begin with one pattern and
stay with it throughout the drill.
Throughout the drill, as always, inhale during the catch-up freestyle
with your head turned to the side. During the butterfly, you may inhale
with your face either forward or to the side, whichever is more
comfortable (the forward breathing style is more common).
3. DPS (Distance Per Stroke): To develop maximum stroke efficiency
for the advanced butterflier.
Count the number of pulls you need per lap, trying to decrease the
number each time by streamlining your stroke. To do this, pause
momentarily at the catch position and take advantage of the glide.
(Remember, though, this is a drill; while swimming the actual stroke, the
catch position is held for a shorter time, keeping the glide to a
minimum.)

UTTERFLY RILLS EGS
Some of these drills may be done with a kickboard or other flotation
device. They may be done with or without fins. Fins are especially
recommended for practicing the dolphin kick, because they help you get
a feel for the whipping motion that you’re trying for. Fins also give you
added propulsion, and they help you to build up your leg strength by
increasing the resistance of the water.
1. Stand and Kick: To get a feel for the wavelike body motion
initiated in the lower-back muscles.
While standing on dry land or in chest-deep water, do a half knee
bend. From this bent-knee position, tilt your hips out to the back; then
press your hips and lower back forward forcefully as you straighten and
stand. Also practice this kick in deep water, with your body in vertical

--- Page 202 Text ---
position.
2. Sit and Kick: To help you learn the bent-knee action of the dolphin
kick.
Sit on the edge of the pool, with hips forward. Bend your knees so that
your heels drop and touch the wall beneath the surface of the water.
From this position, extend your legs again, feeling the water roll off the
front of your foot.
3. Wall Kick: To get the feel of doing the kick in the water; to help
you get your lower back arched slightly while practicing the kick.
In supine position: Hold on to the wall with your back against it, your
head resting on the trough and your arms extended out to either side.
Practice the dolphin kick, watching your form carefully to make sure
that your legs just break the water surface.
In prone position: Facing the wall, pull on the gutter with one hand and
press the other hand flat against the wall, fingers pointed downward,
one to two feet below the surface. Practice the dolphin kick, including
the undulation that travels from the lower back and hips toward the legs
and feet.
4. Free Kick: To help streamline your body during the stroke; to
develop good kicking form; to increase the strength of your kick.
Floating in a prone position, dolphin kick with your arms extended
overhead so that they cover your ears. To inhale, scull momentarily and
lift your head out of the water (either straight forward or to one side).
Or, if you like, keep your arms at your sides so that you can concentrate
on the kick. If you use a kickboard, try the two-beat kick. You can either
keep your head up and breathe normally or coordinate the inhalation
with every other kick. You may also practice this drill in a supine
position.

--- Page 203 Text ---
5. Side Kick: To help develop the wavelike motion of the hips and legs
as well as the body undulation during the dolphin kick.
Dolphin kick while on your side, your lower hand extended overhead,
holding a kickboard, and your top arm resting on your thigh. To inhale,
scull or pull underwater with the extended arm and lift your head
slightly to get a breath; if you use a kickboard, coordinate the breathing
and kicking as in the free-kick drill. Alternate sides.
6. Kick and Roll: To practice the wavelike motion of the kick; to
practice coordinating the arm and leg motions.
Do the side-kick drill, changing positions after every ten kick cycles.
Start on one side; then rotate your body a quarter turn to kick in the
prone position; then rotate another quarter turn to kick on your other
side; then rotate to the prone position again, and so on.
7. Body Wave: To get the feel of the undulating body motion that
comes from the dolphin kick; to help develop breath control.
Pushing off from the pool bottom, your arms extended overhead, dive
over the surface of the water, arching your back and bringing your body
into a “hole” created by your arms (like a porpoise or dolphin).
Submerge and touch your hands to the bottom, then draw your knees up
to your chest in a tuck position. Plant your feet firmly on the bottom and
spring up, arms extended overhead, to repeat the drill.
Under-under Variation: Dolphin kick underwater, arms either
extended in front of you or down at your sides, for as long as
you can.
Under-over Variation: Do this drill in deep water without
touching bottom. Dolphin kick underwater for as long as you
can, then resurface, inhale, and do four kick cycles on the
surface. This drill can be done in pyramid pattern (i.e., two kick
cycles above, two below; four above, four below; six above, six
below; four above, four below; two above, two below; etc.)

UTTERFLY RILLS OORDINATION
1. Single-arm Pull with Single-beat Kick: To develop coordination of
arms, legs, and breathing.
Do one dolphin kick with each arm stroke. Begin by inhaling on every
stroke, then work up to alternate breathing.
2. Two-beat Kick with Delayed Pull: To further coordinate the double-
beat dolphin kick with the butterfly pull.
Do one butterfly pull with one dolphin kick; keep your arms extended
forward in the catch position as you complete the second kick. Make the
glide gradually shorter at the start of each stroke.
3. Progressive Pull with Two-beat Kick: To isolate coordination of the
two-beat kick at the beginning and end of the pull.
Practice the butterfly pull, but recover your arms underwater, and kick
at the beginning and at the end of the pull. See how far you can glide
after each pull-and-kick cycle before recovering your arms underwater.
4. Butterfly Pull with Breaststroke (Whip) Kick: To get a feel for the
overall stroke; a preliminary step in coordinating arms, legs, and
breathing.
Do one butterfly pull for each whip kick. Begin the kick as the hands
enter the water for the catch of the stroke. When both pull and kick have
finished, glide a moment before beginning the next cycle.
This stroke variation can be used either as a drill or as a stroke itself.
Some people also find that this variation helps them to get the flexibility
needed for the dolphin kick. So before skipping over the butterfly stroke,
try this variation—you might like it, especially since the glide gives you
a momentary rest between stroke cycles.
5. Double-arm Backstroke with Whip or Dolphin Kick (Double-arm or
Inverted Butterfly): To develop the flexibility needed for the overwater
arm recovery; to practice phase 2 (acceleration phase) of the pull while
breathing normally.

--- Page 205 Text ---
On your back, do the double-arm or inverted butterfly arm motion
with either a single whip kick or a single-or double-beat dolphin kick.

UTTERFLY RILLS REATHING
Since breathing for this stroke coordinates naturally with the arm
motion, as you practice the pulling drills you’ll be practicing breathing
as well. As your pull and kick become stronger, your head will lift high
enough out of the water for inhalation. To help increase your lung
capacity and help you get a “second wind,” the body-wave drill (this
page) and its variations are also especially useful.
1. Pull-and-breathe Drill: To develop an inhalation pattern with the
butterfly arm motion.
Begin by standing in place and coordinating a single breath with the
pull; then walk forward while adding the alternate breathing pattern.
Concentrate on exhaling during phase 2 of the pull and inhaling
immediately after the arm recovery begins.
2. Freestyle Pull and Dolphin Kick: To develop an alternate breathing
pattern and a sense of timing.
Do the freestyle arm motion, dolphin kicking as you execute phase 2
of each pull. Inhale to the side, as in the freestyle, as you begin the
recovery of every other arm cycle (every four strokes).

IDESTROKE
T
he sidestroke, which grew out of the breaststroke and the elementary
backstroke, was used in competition during the nineteenth century.
Although it’s no longer a competitive stroke, the sidestroke is
nevertheless a handy skill to have. It’s easy to learn and master, and the
long glide and underwater recovery make for a graceful, restful stroke
useful for long, relaxing swims. It is one of the fundamental transitional
strokes for synchronized swimmers. This is the preferred stroke of many
recreational swimmers, especially in open water, because the face
remains above the surface at all times, making breathing easy and
visibility constant. For these reasons, the sidestroke is also widely used
in water rescues.
Since the sidestroke is the least strenuous of the strokes, it isn’t quite
as effective as the other four in improving your physical fitness.
However, the sidestroke is ideal for varying the pace of your workouts,
or when you aren’t up for so strenuous a swim.
L S
EARNING THE IDESTROKE
The sidestroke differs from all the other strokes in several ways. First,
you do it on your side. (Therefore, we’ll be referring to the top and
bottom arm or leg instead of to the right or left.) Second, it is
asymmetrical—neither leg and neither arm does exactly the same thing,
either simultaneously or alternately. The stroke incorporates elements
from the elementary backstroke (see this page) and the breaststroke (see
this page), so if you know either of these strokes, you will recognize
several similarities, including the aforementioned prolonged glide, the
whiplike leg action, and several elements of the arm movement. When

--- Page 209 Text ---
learning or reviewing the sidestroke, try to do it on both sides. One will
probably feel more natural, but with practice, both sides can become
comfortable. (Swimming the same distance on each side results in more
balanced muscle development and body conditioning.) Another way the
sidestroke is unique is that there are so many variations. There are two
types of arm motions and two types of leg motions, which may be
combined in four different ways. When you also consider that you can
do these four variations on either your right or your left side, that adds
up to a total of eight variations. So try them all! You can use several in
the same workout, or even in the same lap, to add variety to your swims.
Body Position
Your body is in a horizontal position on one side. One cheek rests on the
water, and your neck is curved up slightly—just enough for your mouth
to clear the surface. You may look upward and forward, out to the side,
or slightly down and back toward the direction from which you are
swimming (the last is most common).
During the glide, your body is in a straight, stretched, steamlined
position. Your lower arm is extended straight ahead, covering your
lower ear and continuing the line of your body; the palm is down. Your
upper arm is extended and resting along your upper side, palm on your
thigh. Your legs are fully extended and together, one on top of the other,
in line with your body; your toes are slightly pointed.
Arm Motion
In both types of arm motion, the functions of the arm alternate: while
the bottom arm is pulling, the top arm is recovering, and vice versa. The
regular arm motion, in which both arms pull and recover underwater, is
most common and so is described first. The action in both variations is
similar to reaching overhead to pick an apple from a tree, then
transferring the apple to your other hand, and throwing it down toward
your feet as your “picking” arm reaches for the next apple. Unlike other
strokes, the sidestroke is best understood as a two-phased stroke with a
glide after each phase, rather than as a two-phased arm pull. (Each arm

motion, though, still has a catch, a pull, and a recovery.) The

Phase 2. Top arm pulls as bottom arm recovers.
The glide.
Practice while standing on dry land first. Then progress to shoulder-
deep water, first standing, then walking sideways, with the bottom arm
extended underwater in the direction in which you are moving.
Bottom Arm (extended overhead in the glide position): To begin the
catch, slide your hand four to eight inches under the surface to get a
good hold on the water. To begin the pull (phase 1), bend your elbow
and begin to push water straight back with your palm and inner
forearm, keeping the elbow higher than the hand. When your hand and
arm have reached a point just past the shoulder line, accelerate the
movement and continue to press water back down toward your feet. The
pull for this arm stops at chest level, and your elbow stays close to your
body the whole time.
To begin the underwater recovery (phase 2), pull your elbow in closer
to your chest, and rotate your forearm so that the thumb leads the
movement back toward your shoulder. Keep your arm as close to your
body as possible in order to minimize resistance. When your forearm is
as parallel to your torso as possible, extend your arm forward and
overhead back to the starting position. Hold this extended position for
the glide phase of the stroke.
Top Arm: While your bottom arm is pulling, your top arm (resting
along your upper side, palm on thigh) does an underwater recovery
(phase 1). Slide your hand, thumb leading, up toward your shoulder; it
meets and crosses your lower hand, which is just completing its pull, at

--- Page 212 Text ---
approximately chest level. To begin the catch with the top arm, rotate
your forearm so that the palm faces your feet. For the pull (phase 2),
simply press water directly backward toward your feet, using your palm
and the inside of your forearm and making sure that your elbow is
higher than your hand. When your arm is completely extended, place it
on your thigh and hold this position for the glide. (At this point, your
bottom arm has recovered and is extended overhead.) Overarm
Variation: This is a more efficient variation in which the top arm
recovers over the water, similar to the crawl-stroke recovery. From its
extended position on the thigh (glide), raise your top arm above the
surface (elbow high), then slide your hand into the water at a 30-to 45-
degree angle in front of your face (catch). As your arm extends slightly,
it’s now ready to pull (phase 2) as usual.
The overarm variation of the sidestroke.
Leg Motion
The leg motion used in the sidestroke is called the scissors kick because
the legs separate, then come together, cutting through the water much
like the blades of a pair of scissors. As with the arm stroke, there are two
variations. The first described is the regular scissors kick, which is the
most common.
Practice while sitting down, bracing yourself with your hands, leaning
to first one and then the other side. Or, if you want, practice while lying
on your side on the floor.

--- Page 213 Text ---
Begin in the glide or extended position, with your legs together and
the toes pointed. Recover your knees by bringing them toward your
chest, your hips flexing back slightly (phase 1). Then separate and
straighten your legs, the top one moving forward and the bottom one
moving backward. Separate them as much as possible, forming a wide V.
Your top foot should be flexed and the lower one extended with the toes
pointed behind you (catch of the feet). Next squeeze your legs together
to push water backward (phase 2). As your legs meet, point your top
foot—the alternate flexion and extension resembles pedaling a bicycle.
Hold this position, legs together, body extended and streamlined, for the
restful glide. Make sure that your legs move parallel to and stay under
the surface of the water during the entire kick, and try to open each leg
the same distance from the midline of your body.
Inverted Scissors Kick Variation: This is done in the same manner as
the regular kick, except that the bottom leg moves forward and the top
leg moves back. This kick is often used in water rescue carries for greater
mobility and comfort for both the rescuer and victim.
Breathing
Your breathing should be regular and continuous. Inhale during phase 1
as your bottom arm pulls and your top arm and your legs recover. Begin
exhaling during phase 2 as your lower arm recovers, your legs snap
together, and your top arm pulls; continue to exhale during the glide.
Coordinating the Arms and Legs
Remember, this stroke can be simplified into two phases. Think of phase
1 as ending in a tight contraction, as everything in your body bends and
comes together at once at your midpoint. Think of phase 2 as a return to
a stretch as everything straightens and extends to its fullest; hold this for
the glide. Everything begins to happen at once, but imagine the bottom
arm as the crank that starts the action.

--- Page 214 Text ---
1: From the glide position, your bottom arm bends and pulls down
PHASE
toward your chest to initiate this phase, as your top arm and your legs
bend. This phase ends when your hands and knees meet at chest level.
(It helps if you remember that the hand of your top arm moves together
with your top leg.) 2: As your bottom arm extends to recover, your
PHASE
top arm pulls while your legs straighten and squeeze together. Arms and
legs remain extended for a moment for the glide, during which you can
rest and allow the momentum of the stroke to propel you through the
water. When the momentum begins to slow, it’s time to begin the stroke
cycle again.
C B S
HECKLIST FOR A ETTER IDESTROKE
Remember to keep your body stretched and streamlined. Keep
your top shoulder and hip toward the ceiling and your body
perpendicular to the surface of the water.
Keep the arm stroke in a vertical plane; avoid moving your
arms too far out in front or too far behind you.
For greatest streamlining, make sure that the top arm stays
close to your body during the recovery.
Legs should bend toward the chest, extend smoothly outward,
then snap together quickly; hold for the glide.
Keep your legs close to the surface of the water but don’t break
the surface.
As your front leg bends, flex that foot; then point it during the
snap to get the foot to contribute to forward propulsion and
streamlining. Try to keep the motion fluid, as though you were
pedaling a bicycle.
Breathe continuously and rhythmically; time your inhalation to
coincide with the pull of the lower arm (and the recovery of the
top arm and the bending of the legs). Exhale during the
recovery of the bottom arm (and the pull of the top arm and the
straightening of the legs). Continue to exhale during the glide.

--- Page 215 Text ---
Between phases 1 and 2, all four limbs come together at mid-
body. Then all four extend for the glide. Hold this glide until
the momentum begins to fade.
Remember, begin and end stroke in the extended glide position.
Here’s the sequence: phase 1, tuck; phase 2, straighten and
glide.

IDESTROKE RILLS: RMS
Unless you’re very buoyant, you’ll need a flotation device to help
support your body during these drills.
1. One-arm Pull: To practice each arm motion separately, and thereby
to acquire a feel for the two-phase stroke.
To practice the top arm motion, hold a kickboard in front of you with
your bottom arm; your arm is straight, with your hand gripping the front
of the board, and the back end of the board is braced with or near your
armpit. Float on your side, practicing the pull and the recovery of the
regular and/or overarm sidestroke with your top arm.
To practice the bottom arm motion, hold on to the kickboard with
your top hand and place it on your top hip.
Pull one lap of the regular sidestroke with the top arm; then, on
the same side, pull one lap of the regular sidestroke with the
bottom arm.
Repeat, swimming on your opposite side.
Repeat the drill, using the overarm sidestroke, first on one side,
then on the other. Sidestroke for one lap, alternating four
strokes of the regular sidestroke with four of the overarm
sidestroke. Repeat on the opposite side.
2. Stroke and Roll: To use the elementary-backstroke arm motion (see
this page) to lead up to the sidestroke pull.

--- Page 216 Text ---
In a supine position, do the elementary-backstroke arm motion for
four strokes; when you’re in the glide of the fourth stroke, with your
arms at your sides, press one shoulder down toward the pool bottom and
raise your bottom arm overhead (this is a 90-degree or quarter turn). Do
the sidestroke (regular or overarm) on this side for four strokes. Then
return to the supine position and do four more elementary backstroke
pulls; rotate a quarter turn onto your other side and practice the
sidestroke arm motion again. Repeat until comfortable.
3. Two-arm Pull: To isolate and practice the sidestroke arm motions.
Using a flotation device such as a pull-buoy, practice the regular or
overarm sidestroke pull, using both arms together.
Pull one lap on one side using the regular arm stroke; pull the
next lap on the other side using the regular arm stroke.
Pull one lap on one side using the overarm pull; pull the next
lap on the other side using the overarm pull.
Pull for one lap, alternating four regular pulls with four
overarm pulls.

IDESTROKE RILLS EGS
You may need a flotation device to help support you during some of
these kicking drills.
1. Sit-and-Kick Progression: To use the supine whip kick (used in the
elementary backstroke; see this page) to lead up to the regular or
inverted scissors kick.
Begin by sitting on a bench or the edge of the pool deck; review the
supine whip kick. Then lie down on your side and practice either the
regular or the inverted scissors kick. Rotate back to a sitting position to
practice the whip kick again; then turn onto your other side to practice
the scissors kick once more.

--- Page 217 Text ---
2. Wall Kick: To get a feel for the scissors kick in the water.
Use the bracket position (see this page) to float on your side. Practice
the regular scissors or the inverted scissors kick, making sure that your
legs don’t break the surface. Then turn around and practice on the other
side.
3. Free Kick: To practice the regular or the inverted scissors kick
while in proper swimming position; to develop leg power.
Use a kickboard (as described in arm drills) if necessary.
Using the regular scissors kick, kick one lap on one side, the
next lap on the other side.
Using the inverted scissors kick, kick one lap on one side, the
next lap on the other side.
Kick one lap, alternating four regular with four inverted scissors
kicks.
4. Kick and Roll: To use the supine whip kick (see the elementary
backstroke, this page), lead up to the scissors kick.
This is the same idea as the stroke-and-roll drill (this page) except that
instead of alternating the elementary backstroke pull and the sidestroke
pull, you alternate four supine whip kicks with four scissors kicks. If
necessary, use a kickboard (as described in the arm drills) or small
sculling motions to support your upper body.
5. DPK (Distance Per Kick): To measure the efficiency of your scissors
kick.
Kick one lap, counting the number of kicks you need. Then try to
lower the number of kicks (of same kind) on each consecutive lap.

IDESTROKE RILLS OORDINATION
1. Bend and Straighten: To coordinate simultaneous movements of arms

--- Page 218 Text ---
and legs.
Standing first on dry land, then in shoulder-deep water, practice the
various sidestroke combinations in the following form: as your arms
meet at your chest, bend your knees; as the arms extend for the glide
position, straighten your legs. Repeat until the coordination comes
easily.
2. Grapevine Walk: To practice coordinating the eight variations of
the sidestroke.
Next, walk sideways as you coordinate the arm and leg motions by
doing an alternating crossover side step. For the regular scissors kick (top
leg moves forward): as your arms meet at your chest, bend both legs and
cross the “top” leg in front of the “bottom” leg. As your arms extend for
the glide, straighten both legs and bring your back foot around to meet
the front foot, uncrossing your legs and ending with feet together. For
the inverted scissors kick (top leg moves backward): as your arms meet at
the chest, bend both legs and cross the “top” leg behind the “bottom” leg.
As your arms extend for the glide, straighten both legs and bring your
front foot to meet your back foot, uncrossing them and ending with feet
together.
Practice walking each of the eight variations, first on land, then in
shoulder-deep water: 1. Regular arm stroke, regular scissors kick (right
side)
2. Regular arm stroke, regular scissors kick (left side)
3. Regular arm motion, inverted scissors kick (right side)
4. Regular arm motion, inverted scissors kick (left side)
5. Overarm motion, regular scissors kick (right side)
6. Overarm motion, regular scissors kick (left side)
7. Overarm motion, inverted scissors kick (right side)
8. Overarm motion, inverted scissors kick (left side)
3. One-arm Pull with Kick: To coordinate the top and bottom arms
individually with the scissors kick.
Do the one-arm-pull drill (see this page), adding the kick. Practice all
eight variations listed above.

here are two ways to begin a swim: in-the-water starts, which are
discussed here, and out-of-the-water starts, or dives, which are discussed
later. The object of any start is to use the firm resistance of the pool wall
or bottom to give you a speedier, more efficient send-off.
S T
TARTING IPS
All starts have these basic principles in common:
You should push off aggressively; timidity will get you
nowhere.
The power for the push-off comes from the legs. (Jumping jacks
and light weight training will improve your starts.)
Your body should be streamlined and stretched, with your legs
straight and your toes pointed, muscles tight; your head should
be in line with your body and your arms should cover your ears
during the glide.
C /F I -T -W S
RAWL REESTYLE N HE ATER TART
Stand in the water with your knees bent and your back foot braced
against the wall. Extend your arms straight out in front of you in the
glide position and take a bite of air. Immediately drop underwater, brace
your other foot against the wall, and straighten both legs as forcefully as
you can. During the glide, keep your body stretched and streamlined and
your toes pointed. When you begin to lose momentum, start flutter

--- Page 224 Text ---
kicking and you will rise to the surface. Begin your first pull with the
arm opposite your breathing side. Then, as you recover the other arm,
take your first inhalation.
Crawl/freestyle in-the-water start.
A variation is the one-arm side-standing position. Hold on to the
gutter with one hand, elbow bent; extend the other arm forward in the
direction in which you will be swimming, so that your side is facing the
pool wall; rest your cheek on the surface before pushing off.

this stroke.)
B S
ACKSTROKE TART
Grasp the gutter, or the bar on the backstroke starting block if there is
one (in competition, this occurs at the signal “Swimmers”). Place your
feet against the wall just below the water surface (one slightly higher
than the other, if you find that easier), and bend your knees, bringing
your body into a tucked position. Bend your elbows and pull your body
up so that the surface of the water approaches hip level (when the
starter says, “Take your marks”). To push off (at the signal “Go”), swing
your arms around to the sides in a wide, sweeping motion, your head
tilted slightly backward. Arch your back and stretch your body as you
push off with your legs, so that you spring back in a sort of upside-down
swan dive.
Your arms should cover your ears. Ideally, your shoulders, hips, and
legs should clear the water’s surface. Exhale forcefully through your nose
and mouth as you glide below the surface in a streamlined position.
Keeping arms extended overhead, while still underwater, begin to flutter
kick or dolphin kick. Once your torso has entered the water, bend
slightly at the hips, this action will begin to propel you toward the
surface. Before losing momentum, your face should emerge from the
water by taking your first alternating arm pull (not recovery) and
leaving the other arm in the overhead “catch” position.
The dolphin kick is most effective before arms begin stroking. Once
your arms begin pulling, switch to the flutter kick. (This underwater
dolphin kick technique for starts and push-offs was revolutionized by
backstroke 1988/1992 Olympian David Berkoff, who exploded off his
start with the Berkoff Blast-off for thirty-five meters underwater! The

rules currently allow only fifteen meters to be swam beneath the
surface.)

A
dive is really an out-of-the-water start—it begins on land but ends in
the water. As with the in-the-water starts, the object is to use the
resistance of a stationary object (in this case, the pool deck or a starting
block) to give you more distance. Since dives are faster than in-the-water
starts, most races (except for backstroke events) begin this way. But even
if you’re not aspiring to be like multi-Olympic diver Greg Louganis, you
will probably appreciate the thrill of diving and want to learn this useful
skill.
P /P
RACTICE REPARATION
The idea of soaring through the air in a smooth, graceful arc may make
you a bit nervous at first. After all, it’s a different sensation to enter the
water head first, even though your arms are stretched out to protect you.
So, to keep the fun and excitement in, and the pounding heart and shaky
knees to a minimum, it’s important that you learn how to dive correctly
and in gradual stages. In the step-by-step progression that follows, what
you learn in one dive becomes the foundation for what you learn in the
next.
Begin by practicing the shallow surface entry and the sitting dive
entry (Lessons 7 and 8, this page and this page). Next, do surface, or
“porpoise,” dives (see this page) in waist-deep water: imagine you’re
diving over a barrel floating on the surface without touching it. Then
you will learn the kneeling dive, the semi-standing, and the standing
dive. And if you find that you really like diving, go on to learn the racing
dives—whether you plan ever to compete or not.

--- Page 228 Text ---
D T
IVING IPS
All dives share these five components:
1. Stance: Once you are sitting, kneeling, or standing, with toes curled
around the edge of the pool, your body is balanced, poised, and ready
for takeoff.
2. Takeoff: The energy comes from the legs; the push-off is aggressive
and assertive; your eyes look diagonally forward and downward.
3. Flight: The body extends and arcs smoothly through the air; your
position is taut and streamlined.
4. Entry: The arms are extended and enter the water first; the head is
tucked down between them, ears covered.
5. Recovery: You ascend to the surface in a smooth arc by lifting your
chin and angling your hands and arms upward.
For Safe Diving
Check pool regulations for safe diving.
Be sure you dive into water that’s deep enough. Depending on
the height of pool edge and your height, the water should be at
least nine feet deep.
Check pool markers and ask the lifeguard to determine safe
depth.
If there are no markers, enter feet first initially to test depth.
This is especially important in an open water environment.
Review and practice diving skills in a safe progression.

--- Page 229 Text ---
Extend your arms over your head during every dive.
If you wear goggles, you’ll have to make the strap a bit tighter
than usual to keep them on as you enter the water.
Do not use competitive starting blocks or platforms unless
supervised.
K D
NEELING IVE
To assume the stance, kneel at the edge of the pool, with your weight on
one knee and the toes of your other foot curled securely around the edge
for traction. (If it’s uncomfortable to kneel, raise the weight-bearing knee
off the ground slightly.) Tuck your chin to your chest and extend your
arms straight out in front of you with your biceps tight against your ears.
The most common diving error is raising the head during entry. Since
the body follows the path of the head, lifting the head is what makes for
so many belly whops. Also remember to keep your eyes open throughout
the dive—since you’ll be landing in the water head first, you want to see
where you’re going. To keep your arms straight and your hands together,
hook your thumbs, or grasp one wrist with the other.
To begin the takeoff, lean forward so that your hands almost touch the
water. Keep leaning farther and farther, gradually shifting your weight
forward until your rear foot lifts off the deck and your body begins to
“fall” toward the surface. Bring your legs together as you enter the
water. Don’t give in to the temptation to raise your head. And as you
practice, start to push off with the forward leg, so that instead of falling
into the water you spring with energy. Also, point your hands downward
at a 45-degree angle on entry and point your toes and tighten your leg
muscles to obtain a streamlined position.
Begin to exhale a second before you hit the surface. Once in the water,
continue to exhale slowly, and stretch and streamline your body as it
glides through the water in a downward arc.

--- Page 230 Text ---
Kneeling dive.
To recover, point your fingers upward. Arch your back slightly, lifting
your chin and raising your head and arms toward the surface. You may
begin to kick, or simply assume a prone float, prior to recovering to a
stand.

EMI TANDING IVE IP N IVE
Once you are comfortable with the kneeling dive, learn to dive from a
slightly higher stance. Stand with one foot in back of the other (with the
toes of the forward foot curled securely around the edge of the deck so
that you don’t slip). Bend (pike) at the waist with your head tucked
down (looking forward or toward the bottom) and your arms extended
overhead and hugging your ears. Then press your head and arms
downward, while your back leg presses upward. Lean forward, lifting the
back foot off the deck and shifting all your weight onto your front leg,
until you “fall” toward the surface. As you enter, fingertips leading,
straighten your legs and bring them together, toes pointed. Make an arc
underwater, as you did for the kneeling dive, and remember to keep
your head tucked down and your arms close to your ears until it is time
to recover to the surface.

TANDING IVE

--- Page 231 Text ---
Stand in a piked position with your knees bent slightly, both feet
together, toes curled around the pool edge. Again, your arms are
extended straight in front of you at a 45-degree angle to the water, your
head is down, and your biceps are covering your ears. Think of your
body as a seesaw with your hips as the fulcrum. Bend your knees further,
then straighten them during takeoff to give the dive a spring and
therefore more height. As you push off, lift your hips, tighten your legs
and extend them up and straight behind you, and point your toes. As
your skill improves, gradually straighten your body out of the piked
position during the flight. Keep your head down and your arms extended
as you stretch and spring up and over, traveling in a smooth, graceful
arc before entering the water. Since the higher stance of the standing
dive increases your distance from the water, you will enter faster and
deeper than with the kneeling or semi-standing dives. This may result in
a longer recovery, so remember to exhale slowly until you’ve surfaced.

Standing dive.
R D
ACING IVES
There are basically two competition starts, the conventional wind-up,
and the grab start. You can vary starts and entries according to your
ability and needs, but the shallower entry should be mastered before
going on to the newer piked entry.
Wind-up or Arm-swing Dive (with Shallow Entry)
The conventional wind-up dive has been used for many years for all
strokes swum in the prone position. Even if you’re a fitness swimmer,
you too may prefer to enter the water for a workout using this clean and
fairly shallow dive.
In competition, the dive takes place off a starting block thirty inches
above the water’s surface. The object is to create as much horizontal
forward propulsion and as little resistance as possible. In order to do
this, you create a “hole” in the water for your body to enter. This is also
termed a nonresistance entry because the body enters the water cleanly,
through a vacuum that it has created for itself.

--- Page 233 Text ---
Before learning the dive, get the feel of the “hole” by practicing this
drill in waist-deep water. Push off forcefully from the bottom of the
pool, diving over the surface of the water. During the over-the-water arc,
extend your arms overhead, arch your back, and lift your head. Then, as
you enter the water, drop your head and round your shoulders, so the
rest of your body passes through the “hole” created by your shoulders
and arms.
To begin the wind-up dive (in competition, at the signal “Swimmers”),
step forward to the edge of the pool or onto the starting block. Stand
straight with your toes curled tightly over the edge, feet about hip width
apart. Bend your knees (at the signal “Take your marks”), and let your
arms hang wherever they feel comfortable and balanced. Your weight is
forward, on the balls of your feet, and your eyes are looking ahead.
To push off (at the signal “Go”—a gun, whistle, horn, beeper, etc.),
drop your head, round your shoulders, and swing your arms vigorously
backward and upward. As your body leans forward (or “overbalances”),
swing your arms back down and around to the front in a semicircle.
Begin to extend your legs to initiate the takeoff.
Continue to push off, straightening your legs and lifting your head to
look at your target. By the time your feet lift off, your arms have stopped
their swing and are straight ahead of you, pointed forward and
downward at a shallow angle. Your legs are as stretched and streamlined
as possible. Once you’re completely extended over the water, drop your
head downward to try to get your body to pass through the “hole” made
by your hands. Your entry should be relatively flat, at about a 10-to 20-
degree angle.
Wind-up racing dive with shallow entry.

--- Page 234 Text ---
After you’ve entered the water, glide, holding your streamlined
position, until you begin to lose momentum; then initiate the kick,
followed by the arm motion.
Grab Start (with Shallow Entry)
This is a newer variation of the racing dive. Although it is similar to the
wind-up start in many ways, it usually gets you into the water faster.
Stand at the edge of the pool or on the starting block (at the call of
“Swimmers”), your feet hip width apart and your toes curled around the
edge. Bend forward at the waist (at the signal “Take your marks”) and
grasp the gutter of the pool or the platform or bar of the starting block.
Your hands are usually between your feet at this point, but you can also
place them outside your feet. The grab position should allow you to
balance your weight forward over the starting block. At the signal “Go”
overbalance your body by pulling and stretching your shoulders and
head down. Then release the platform or bar as your torso goes forward.
This levels off your trajectory as you leave the starting block in much the
same way that the wind-up arm swing of the conventional racing dive
does, but the grab start takes less time.
As your hands release, look up toward the end of the pool and swing
your arms up and forward. Follow through with your body and
straighten your knees to begin the forward thrust. As your arms extend
completely, at a 45-degree angle downward to the water, let your legs
extend fully behind you, completing the takeoff. Your hips should pike
in the air to help your body enter the “hole” created by your arms. Your
hands may overlap for the entry, which is at a greater downward angle
(approximately 30 to 45 degrees) than that of the shallow entry.
To recover, lift your head and arch your back slightly. Begin flutter
kicking and, as you surface, initiate the arm stroke.
Pike Entry
This is a newer version of the racing-dive entry. Although it’s usually
used with a grab start, you can also use it with the wind-up dive. The
pike entry is faster than the more shallow entry because it takes

--- Page 235 Text ---
advantage of the whipping action of your legs and hips during the flight
to give you additional propulsion.
Assume your stance, looking diagonally forward and down. As you
push off with your legs, spring up into the air. Lift your head as your
hands drive forward to lift your hips higher than your original standing
position. Then bend your hips to assume a partial jackknife position.
Enter the water hands first with head dropped between your arms; then,
as your shoulders enter, straighten your hips and pull them down into
the “hole” that your arms have made. Since your body position is deeper
here than in other racing dives, begin your kick early to help you rise to
the surface quickly. If you’ve done it correctly, you’ll know it—compare
your distance with that from the other dives.

f you swim laps in a pool, you should have at least some idea about
what to do when you get to the other end. Just how do you turn your
body around in an efficient, graceful way in order to begin the next lap?
Turns are the answer. They also add variety to your swimming workouts,
and the push-off stage is an effective way to condition your legs.
The turns are slightly different for each stroke, but all have the same
purpose: to use your body’s momentum to make a 180-degree turn—and
to do it with no wasted effort and no pause. There are two basic types of
turns. In ascending order of speed, efficiency, difficulty, and
impressiveness, they are the open turn (used in all strokes, along with the
closed-turn variation used in the crawl) and the flip turn (used in crawl
and backstroke). Fitness swimmers should learn at least the open turn
for each stroke, but there’s no need to stop there. The closed crawl turn
will come easily as your fitness, breath control, and confidence increase.
Before long you may be tempted to try the flip turn—and you’ll be able
to do it, too, by following the step-by-step progression explained below.
In addition, there are transitional turns used to change from one stroke to
another, as when you go from swimming the freestyle to swimming the
breaststroke.

URNING IPS
Remember, there are five components to any kind of turn:
1. The Approach: Timing is important here. In order to begin the turn
at just the right moment, you must be able to judge the distance between
your body and the end of the pool, so that you will be in proper position

--- Page 239 Text ---
as you near the wall. Use your momentum to accelerate as you approach
the wall.
2. The Turn: During the 180-degree turn, you shift your body so that
your feet are planted on the wall and your torso is facing the new
direction. Just before push-off, your body should be tucked, or coiled, as
tightly as possible, ready to spring into action.
3. The Push-off: Be aggressive during this phase. Push off forcefully
with your legs, as though the wall of the pool were the floor and you
were trying to jump as high into the air as possible. Don’t hesitate; the
idea is to hit the wall and ricochet off it like a bullet.
4. Glide: Extending and streamlining your body, glide through the
water on the momentum from the explosive push-off.
5. Recovery: When the glide begins to slow, resurface and
immediately initiate the stroke so that you don’t lose the momentum.
Usually you resume kicking first, then add the arm motion.
In general, you should be sure of your open turns before attempting
the closed turn; once you have the closed turn, you can move on to the
flip turns used in the crawl and backstroke. Practice each turn in shallow
water first, if possible, before trying it in deep water. Always practice
turning to both sides an equal number of times; try not to favor one side
over the other. This is especially important in the crawl and the
backstroke, which have alternating arm movements—you never know
which arm will be leading when you reach the wall. But it’s important in
the other strokes, too, because the top leg tends to exert more force than
the bottom leg during the push-off. So turning to both sides helps to
balance muscle development as well.

This is the easiest type of turn, and you should learn it before attempting
the more advanced ones. There are two important things to remember:
the first is to keep your body as low in the water as possible during the
inhalation; try to let just your head come up out of the water—not your
shoulders. The second thing to remember is the principle of opposing
hands—the hand that contacts the wall is opposite the side to which you
are going to turn. For example, if your left arm touches the wall, you
turn to the right.
Crawl-stroke/Freestyle Open Turn
Approach the wall with your eyes open and your face in the water; look
slightly forward so that you can see the marker on the bottom and/or on
the wall (in the absence of either of these, look for the line at which the
bottom meets the wall). Try to maintain your normal stroke as you
arrive at the wall with one arm extended in the catch position; try not to
shorten your stroke or to glide too much. As you approach the wall,
“kick in” if necessary rather than overstroking.
To begin the turn, grasp the gutter with your extended hand (in the
absence of a gutter, press your hand against the wall at water level to
stabilize your body). As your hand touches, flex your elbow, bring your
head and body in close to the wall, allow your opposite shoulder to
drop, and rotate 180 degrees so that you’re facing the new direction. As
you rotate, bend your knees and swing your feet and hips under your
body. Lift your head just enough to inhale quickly as your weight shifts.
As your feet contact the wall, let go with your hand and swing it over
your shoulder and drop it about one foot beneath the surface to join
your other arm, which stays extended away from the wall throughout.
Both arms are now stretched over your head and pointing toward the
opposite end of the pool, your feet are still pressed against the wall, and
your entire body is slightly on its side.
Next, push off forcefully from the pool wall by extending your body
and straightening your knees. Keep your body streamlined, arms
stretched overhead, knees locked and toes pointed. As you begin your
glide, rotate back into a fully prone position and continue the glide

--- Page 241 Text ---
toward the surface.
As you begin to lose the momentum of the push-off, start to flutter
kick. As you surface, add the arm stroke, pulling first with the arm
opposite your breathing side; as you complete the pull on your breathing
side, take your first inhalation.

The push-off
: Learn the open turn in gradual steps:
PRACTICE
In shallow water, practice the in-the-water start, the push-off,
the glide, and the recovery and stroke initiation.
Next, add the turn. Start by grasping the gutter or touching the
wall with one hand, leaving the other arm extended toward the
opposite end of the pool. Place your feet on the wall in the
push-off position, with your head resting on your free arm,
which remains extended about one foot below the surface
toward the opposite end of the pool. Inhale, drop underwater,
and push off. Practice on each side of your body.
Walk toward the wall with one arm extended and practice the
entire open turn first with one hand, then the other. Repeat,
this time kicking toward the wall with one arm extended.
Finally, swim toward the wall and do the open turn.
Crawl/Freestyle Closed Turn
The closed turn is faster than the open turn because the transition is
smoother and more efficient. Learning the closed turn is also an
intermediate step in learning the freestyle flip turn, and it helps to
develop your controlled breathing. The closed turn is done exactly like
an open turn except that your face stays underwater. Just before your

--- Page 243 Text ---
forward arm touches the wall, take a big bite of air; then return your
face to the water.
Backstroke Open Turn
In this stroke, although you can’t see the approaching wall, you can still
use your momentum to advantage. To begin the turn, grab the gutter or
deck edge with one hand (or press the hand to the wall at water level,
palm flat and thumb up). Bend and drop your elbow to bring your head
and body close to the wall as you turn toward your contact arm. Tuck
your knees in close to your chest and, keeping your free arm extended in
the direction you just came from, turn 180 degrees on your back so that
you end up facing the wall with your feet touching it. Inhale as you
bring the contact arm overhead to meet the extended one.
To initiate the push-off, stretch your arms and upper body as you
straighten your knees. Keep your head tucked between your arms,
slightly underwater; as you glide, approach the surface at a slight angle,
exhaling continually.
Backstroke open turn.

The turn.
The push-off.
To recover to the surface, begin to flutter kick as your momentum
from the push-off decreases. Take a pull with one arm just as you reach
the surface, keeping the other arm extended in the catch position for the
best streamlining. Inhale when your face clears the water. When the first
arm begins to recover, pull with the other arm.
Instead of turning your head continually to take a peek at the
approaching wall (thus losing momentum), you can use some sort of
stationary reference point (such as the flags strung width-wise across
some pools five yards from each end, or even a ladder) to warn you of

--- Page 245 Text ---
your arrival. Just remember the number of strokes needed to reach the
end from this point. As you arrive at the wall, keep one arm extended
overhead in the catch position and kick in, with the other arm remaining
in the direction from which you came.
: Learn the open turn in gradual steps:
PRACTICE
Practice in shallow water, beginning with the in-the-water
push-off, the glide, the recovery and stroke initiation.
Walk backward toward the wall with one hand extended to it
and the other hand facing the opposite end of the pool. When
your hand contacts the wall, make an open turn. Repeat,
contacting with the other hand.
Next, flutter kick toward the wall on your back, with one hand
extended behind you; practice the open turn first on one side,
then on the other.
Finally, backstroke to the wall and do the open turn (remember
to check for your landmark as you approach the wall).
Breaststroke Open Turn
Approach the wall with your eyes open, looking slightly forward so that
you can see it coming. Try to maintain your speed and rhythm, and try
to arrive at the wall in full stroke, both arms extended underwater in
front of you, parallel to the water surface and to each other.
To begin the turn, touch the wall at surface level with both hands. As
you touch the wall, immediately inhale and turn toward one side by
driving that shoulder into the water at a 90-degree angle and drawing
the same elbow to your side. As you turn, swing the other arm of the
driving shoulder away from the wall, and pivot 180 degrees, being
certain to complete your inhalation before your head drops. Release the
other hand from the wall as you pivot; then bend your legs and bring
them under your body, planting your feet on the wall, one higher than
the other. (As your turn improves, you may notice that during this
exchange there is a moment when no part of your body is touching the
wall.) Extend both arms in front of you; your body is still slightly tilted

--- Page 246 Text ---
or rolled on the driving shoulder side. (Some competitive swimmers
attempt to obtain additional streamlining by crossing their feet and
hands during the turn.) Breastroke and butterfly open turn.

The push-off.
Push off by straightening your legs and extending your body into a
streamlined, fully prone position. Also, push off at a slightly downward
angle (hips higher than head and arms) to take advantage of this extra
bit of speed. During this deeper push-off, you should feel as if you are
going downhill for a moment (“downstreaming”). As you begin to lose
the momentum from the push-off, take one underwater pull (see
“Breaststroke In-The-Water Start,” this page). Make this pull as powerful
as possible and don’t stop at shoulder level as usual—extend the pull by
bringing the hands under your chest and abdomen and pushing all the
way under the thighs. As you recover the arms, take one kick, moving
the hips up to get the dolphin body wave (see this page). Then, as you
surface, begin to take your second arm pull to continue the breaststroke.
In competition, you are allowed only one pull and one kick before your
head must break the surface.
: Practice this turn in stages, on each side of your body.
PRACTICE
Practice the in-the-water start (the push-off, the glide, and the
recovery and stroke initiation) in shallow water.
Add the turn, grasping the wall with both hands to negotiate
the exchange. Try to increase your distance each time you
practice.
Walk to the wall with both arms extended and practice the
turn. Next, kick to the wall with both arms extended and make

the turn.
To get more speed in the turn, you can lift your head as you
contact the wall, then start the rotation immediately.
Butterfly Open Turn
Like the breaststroke turn, the butterfly turn is a two-hand touch.
However, do not push off at as deep an angle as in the breaststroke push-
off. During the glide, extend your body into a streamlined, fully prone
position and keep your arms extended in front of you. (Unlike the
breaststroke turn, there’s no underwater pull.) The glide is followed
immediately by one or more dolphin kicks to help you surface.

Sidestroke Open Turn
Use a variation of the crawl-stroke open turn. Touch the wall with the
leading arm, shift your weight, bringing your feet around to touch the
wall and driving the shoulder of the free arm into the water at a 90-
degree angle. Push off and initiate the stroke, swimming on the side
opposite the one you used during the previous lap.
F T
LIP URNS
Flip turns may be done during the freestyle and backstroke. The flip
(which is like a somersault combined with a twist for the crawl, and
actually more like a swivel for the backstroke) adds speed and power to
the turn.
Freestyle Flip Turn
Approach the wall, looking forward and, if necessary, accelerating your
stroke. When your leading arm is two to four feet from the wall, tuck
your chin to your chest, pull with your extended arm (so that both arms
are at your sides), and do a dolphin kick (see this page) to initiate the
flip.
The timing of the turn is very important. In general, it’s best to judge
the distance conservatively (i.e., to give yourself more room than you
need to execute the turn) than to cramp the turn and possibly hit your
heels on the deck. Just prior to beginning your flip, when you take your

--- Page 250 Text ---
last rhythmic breath, be certain to get a big bite of air (because you will
not take another breath until you surface after the flip).
To begin the flip, back water (scoop water from your hips toward your
face) with the arm opposite the side to which you are going to turn. To
lift your hips and legs up out of the water, bend your upper body
forward and push water toward your abdomen with your leading arm.
Then tuck your body and bend your knees, as the lower part of your legs
come out of the water.
As your feet flip over your head, twist your trunk to one side. (It may
help to make a little circular motion at this point with the hand on the
side that you are turning toward; e.g., if you turn to the right, circle with
your right hand.) As you complete the flip, begin to straighten out of the
tuck; plant your feet on the wall and begin to extend both arms in front
of you.
On the push-off, continue to twist and extend your body during the
glide so that you finish face down in a fully prone position.
Recover to the surface (as in the other turns) by lifting your head and
arching your back (hyperextending your body) to streamline your body
before beginning to flutter kick.
: Practice the flip turn in gradual steps:
PRACTICE
First get accustomed to somersaulting in water. Practice this
from a standing position while walking and then while
swimming in shallow water.
Next practice the closed turn, contacting your extended hand
lower and lower on the wall (hand flat, fingers pointed
downward), and gradually lifting your hips and legs higher and
higher out of the water.
When your hand makes contact about two feet below the water
surface, add the full somersaulting and twisting action.

Backstroke Spin Turn
This is similar to the open turn, but you’ll contact the wall with the palm
of your extended hand, fingers pointing downward. Arch your arm,
cocking your wrist just prior to contacting the wall. As you touch,
continue to kick in, bending your elbow, bringing your head and body
close to the wall, and taking a bite of air. Bend your knees, legs together,
so that they emerge from the water. As your head tucks down to your
chest and your upper body drops below the surface, your lower body
spins 180 degrees in a sideways position.
Quickly spin your legs and hips over the shoulder of your extended
arm, so that your feet land on the wall, ready for push-off. To help you
turn, use your free arm, which initially is near your hips, to back water
(to push water up toward your face). As you turn, the free arm ends up
back overhead, where it continues to back water.
As you plant your feet on the wall, extend both arms overhead for
maximum streamlining. Push off, glide, recover, and initiate the stroke

--- Page 254 Text ---
as you would for the backstroke open turn.
Practice the backstroke spin by mastering the open turn first. As you
turn, gradually lift your legs and hips higher and higher, still keeping
your upper body in an arched position, chest up. The lower your contact
hand, the more leverage you will have to spin your legs around.
Backstroke Flip Turn
This is similar to the freestyle flip turn. As you approach the wall, roll
onto your arm that is extended overhead into a prone position, and pull
both arms under your body. Both arms are now at your sides so you can
begin to flip. Turn your palms to face the bottom of the pool. Scoop
them overhead, flipping your legs out of the water so that your feet then
contact the wall. Push off from this tuck position, staying on your back,
and resume a streamlined backstroke push-off.

RANSITIONAL URNS SED IN NDIVIDUAL EDLEY
Occasionally you will want to change from one stroke to another, so you
will have to modify the turns somewhat. This occurs, for instance, in the
competitive event called the Individual Medley (or IM), where one goes
from swimming the butterfly to the backstroke, to the breaststroke, to
the freestyle—without stopping. For instance, 1992 Olympian swimmer
Summer Sanders utilized transitional turns in her medal-winning swims.
IMs, naturally, are often incorporated into fitness workouts because
they’re a great way to add variety to your swimming, no matter what
your level.
Butterfly to Backstroke
Touch the wall with both hands and tuck your body, bringing your feet
to the wall. Inhale at this point. Then push off as you would for the
backstroke start. A faster variation is to drop one shoulder after touching
the wall, pushing off sideways to avoid your own wake and being certain
both arms are extended overhead before push-off.

--- Page 255 Text ---
Backstroke to Breaststroke
To accomplish this as an open turn, begin the open backstroke turn,
bringing your knees toward your chest as your body rotates (with the
hips as the fulcrum) from a supine to a prone position. Inhale at this
point. You will now be facing the new direction. Let go of the wall and
swing your arm to meet the leading arm, which has remained in place
during the turn. Drop your head and push off.
To do this as a flip turn, begin by taking a quick bite of air. Bring your
knees directly overhead and rotate to a prone position, ending up facing
in the new direction. Push off as usual.
Breaststroke to Freestyle
As you touch the wall with two hands, immediately release one arm and
bring it around over the water in the same direction that you will turn.
Inhale as you pivot and swing the other arm to meet the first; push off
on one side and during the glide gradually untwist to end up in a fully
prone position.
T E
URNING WITH QUIPMENT
You’re not a show-off if you turn while using equipment—it’s actually
easier to do some turns this way. If you’re wearing a combination of
equipment, combine the following techniques as applicable.
Kickboards
Reach for the wall with one hand while the other holds on to the
kickboard. Turn 180 degrees in either direction as the leading edge of
the board approaches the wall, as for the open turn. Keep your arms
extended and your body streamlined as you come out of the turn.
Pull-buoy

--- Page 256 Text ---
You may do a flip or an open turn (eventually, a flip will be the easiest).
For either of them, be certain that your legs are pressed together, so that
you don’t lose the pull-buoy. As you approach the wall with your
forward arm, execute the turn of your choice, bend your knees into a
tucked position, and press your thighs together as tightly as possible. As
you come out of the turn, initiate your stroke with a pull (or you can do
a dolphin kick).
Fins
Since you swim faster with fins, you’ll need to anticipate the wall earlier
than usual. During the open, closed, or flip turn, begin to tuck your
knees to your chest as you approach the wall. Be certain to flex your feet
toward your shins, the fins hitting the wall as flat as possible, so that you
don’t “trip” on them.
Hand Paddles
Since you can’t grasp the gutter while wearing hand paddles, approach
the wall with your forward hand flexed (even if you’re doing an open
turn and usually grasp the gutter). Plant your forward hand on the wall
sideways, your fingers pointing in the direction of the turn, below water
level. Continue the turn as usual, recovering with your hands on, next to,
or on top of each other—paddles pointed downward. Using hand paddles
won’t interfere with your flip turn.

HE RAINING FFECT
It’s all because of Milo. He’s the wrestler who walked around ancient
Greece all day with a calf draped over his shoulders. Every day, as the
calf grew larger, Milo grew stronger from bearing the increasing weight.
Today, Milo’s method would draw more than a few snickers even from
warm-up-suit-clad fitness freaks. But in a manner of speaking, we too
carry growing calves on our shoulders when we “work out” regularly: all
training is based on the age-old principle of gradual overload and our
body’s adaptation to it.
All the components of total fitness—endurance, strength, flexibility,
and speed—depend upon this basic principle: by overloading your body,
by making demands on it that are just a bit more than it can handle
comfortably, you force it to adapt. This marvelous adaptation is known
as the “training effect.” Your body will, of course, protest a bit (“no pain,
no gain”), and can only adjust to a certain amount of strain without
injury. But if you train sensibly and increase the workload gradually, it
will reward you with the capability to work harder and perform better
under all conditions.
In a well-designed, all-round fitness program, you become stronger
because initially your muscle fibers break down under the strain and use
the diminishing supply of oxygen and nutrients less and less efficiently
(that’s why you get tired and perhaps a bit sore). Then they regenerate
and, in the process, become stronger and more efficient (just as scar
tissue is tougher than unscared skin, and a fracture, once healed, is
stronger than the rest of the bone). Muscle fibers also become
permanently elongated, giving you greater flexibility. At the same time,
your cardiovascular system eventually comes to supply blood and
oxygen more efficiently, giving you greater endurance.
How fit you become depends upon your inherited physical
capabilities, how much time you spend training, how far your
enthusiasm carries you, and what your goals are. For example, you

--- Page 259 Text ---
might set one or more of these goals for yourself:
Distance: 1 mile
Speed: 50 yards in 1 minute
Weight Loss: 10 pounds
Skills: learn the butterfly; master the crawl
Competition: win one 50-yard race
Appearance: lose 1 inch off hips; firm up thighs and chest

HY OLLOW A ORKOUT?
A swimming workout is a specific length of time (for most swimmers
from one half to one hour is about right) during which you develop your
swimming ability and improve your physical condition. If you’re
interested, a workout will also prepare you for competition. A good
workout does not mean that you jump into the water and start
swimming as fast as you can for as long as you can. For one thing, that’s
dangerous; for another, it’s boring; for yet another, it won’t improve
your swimming or your fitness all that much. To be effective, there must
be a method to your training. Some competitive swimmers train under
the watchful eyes of a swim coach, whose job it is to devise their
workouts. By following the workouts in this section, you too will have
your own coach—on paper.
F W
OLLOWING THE ORKOUTS
There are four phases to the following fitness program. (I) Beginner, (II)
Intermediate, (III) Advanced, and (IV) Super (geared toward people who
want to compete, or at least to be as physically fit as competitive
swimmers).
Where you begin the program depends on how fit you are now (as
indicated by how far you can swim without stopping) and how many
skills you’ve already mastered. Where you end is up to you—if you want
to be a competitive swimmer, it should be phase IV; but if you just want

--- Page 260 Text ---
to be reasonably fit, that would be the end of the Intermediate phase.
The program is progressive. Each phase has ten workouts—along with
tips on how to vary them—that are designed to increase your fitness and
your skills gradually. Once you’ve found your level, repeat each workout
at least three times before going on to the next. If you work out:
Once Your skills will improve; your fitness will improve somewhat; and you will enjoy the

week:
Three You will also improve your physical condition, help to control your weight, and
times improve your muscle tone. (Studies have shown that it takes twelve to twenty weeks
a working at a minimum of three days per week to affect your cardiovascular
week: conditioning; alternating days of training with rest days gives your body time to
recover.)
Every You will progress even faster and become even more fit. (Actually, you should work out
day: only six days in a row at the most, and give your body a rest on the seventh.) Studies
have shown that during the first ten weeks of a conditioning program the training effect
is similar whether you exercise three days a week or more; but after that, exercising
five or six times a week will result in faster and greater progress.
However often you choose to work out, don’t skip any level, and wait
until you feel you’re ready before you go on to the next stage. Strive for
a balance between taking it too easy and pushing yourself too hard and
too fast. Listen to your body. Physical fitness, like Rome, isn’t built in a
day. (See “Watch Out!” below.) After a workout, you should feel
exhilarated yet pleasantly tired. Your body should feel more relaxed, yet
stronger, more flexible, and more alive.

My program is a step-by-step progression. Don’t skip any level—in your

workouts; if it persists, consult a physician. Moderation is the key; heed

To help prevent them, follow these tips:
If you have any doubt as to your physical condition, have a
checkup before you begin.
Maintain a balanced diet.
Warm up thoroughly before the main set of your workout, and
cool down afterward.
Monitor your pulse to make sure you don’t exceed your target
rate.
Make sure you’re comfortable at your present level before you
proceed to the next.
Don’t swim when you’re injured, sick, or very tired. Use your
judgment here—even if you’re not up to a full workout, you
may be able to take a short swim, practice a few skills, or do
some water exercises.

RAINING ONCEPTS
You get the training effect when you overload your body by increasing
the intensity, frequency, and duration of your swims. There are a
number of ways to accomplish this, and you don’t have to be a
competitive swimmer to use these tried-and-true training methods. All of
the following concepts we used in the workouts that follow. You can also
use these underlying principles to create your own workouts or
individualize those on this page-this page. Depending on your goals,
your pool facility, and your mood, you may choose to emphasize some
over others. By incorporating them all into your swimming program,

--- Page 262 Text ---
though, you’re sure to keep your workouts interesting and challenging,
and to subject your body to different types of stress.
Marathon, or Distance, Swimming: This is swimming for a relatively
long distance without stopping for a rest. You can either swim easily
without regard to the clock, or time the swim or some part of it. Without
some sort of timing, though, most people tend to take it too easy and
swim too slowly (pulse rate remains under the target rate) to get much
conditioning. You’ll still burn up calories, and it’s an excellent way to
swim if you’re tired. The term “garbage yardage” is popularly used to
describe long, easy swims that aim for quantity instead of quality. Even
if you don’t use the clock, you can still vary your pace—just swim parts
a little faster, some a little slower. Or you can try to pace the entire
swim; this offsets the tendency to start too fast, wear yourself out, and
limp the last few laps home. Marathon swims are used primarily to
improve your endurance; your heart rate doesn’t climb that high (about
50–60 percent of maximum); but it stays at that level for the duration.
Although you might not have thought so, this type of swim is often used
as a warm-up before the main set. Every time you swim marathon-style,
try to increase your distance by at least a few laps; common goals are
400 yards/meters (about a quarter mile), 800 yards/meters (about half a
mile), or 1,600 yards/meters (about one mile). To keep track of your
marathon swims, enter them on one of the Red Cross 50-mile swim
charts that are posted at many pools.
Fartlek Training: Long a favorite training technique in Sweden
(especially for running), this method breaks a swim into alternating slow
and fast laps. It not only makes a long swim (for instance, 500
yards/meters or more) more interesting, it’s a great way to develop
speed and endurance simultaneously, because the slow laps, at about 50
percent of your maximum heart rate, enable you to exert yourself more
during the fast laps, during which you swim at 80 percent of your
maximum. You can modify the Fartlek technique by varying the number
of laps swum at each speed. For instance, you can swim pyramid style: 1
fast, 1 slow; 2 fast, 2 slow; 3 fast, 3 slow; 2 fast, 2 slow; 1 fast, 1 slow.

Make up your own patterns.
Interval Training: In this method, which was introduced into
competitive swimming workouts during the 1940s, you do a series of
repeat swims of the same distance, each within a specified length of
time. The amount of rest you have after each swim is determined by how
fast you go. For instance, if the interval set is four 50-yard swims in 1
minute and 15 seconds each (4 × 50 on 1:15), and you take 1 minute to
swim the first 50, you have 15 seconds’ rest before beginning the next
50-yard swim; if you swim the 50 yards in 45 seconds, you have 30
seconds to rest.
Competitive swimmers swim at slower speeds in a workout than
during the actual competiton, but the intervals are still pretty fast—100s
on 1:30 is typical at this level.

Distances, rest intervals, and target pulse rates will vary, depending on

Usually, intervals are designed to give swimmers a short rest period
relative to the length of time spent swimming. This way, you don’t allow
the heart rate to drop too much, but the short rest lets you push yourself

harder during each swim, which results in greater cardiovascular
benefits. Interval swimming, therefore, is the best all-round training
method for developing speed and endurance. This method should get
your heart rate up to approximately 70 percent of your maximum during
the swim, and the rest period should be short enough so that your heart
rate doesn’t recover all the way down to your resting rate. Intervals are
widely used as part or all of the main set of a workout.
It’s easiest if you begin each interval set on the 60-second mark: if the
interval were 1 minute (1:00), you would begin the second swim when
the second hand hit the 60-second mark. If the interval were on 1:15,
you would begin the first swim on the 60-second mark, the second on
the 15-second mark, the third on the 30-second mark, and so on.
(Another type of interval training may be used, too, in which the amount
of rest is held constant—say, 10 seconds after each 50 yards/meters—
regardless of the time it takes you to do each swim.)
Repetition, or Repeat, Training: These are sets of swims of the same
distance done at close to maximum effort (up to 90 percent of your
maximum heart rate), but with a long rest period after each swim
(usually equal to the swimming time) that allows the heart rate to come
back down to nearly normal. This type of swimming develops your speed
and anaerobic capacity (the ability to work at intense levels, by using
stored oxygen, for moderate periods of time); since it is fatiguing, this
method is used sparingly, usually to prepare competitive swimmers for
peak performances, and only after a thorough warm-up.
Sprints: These are short, fast swims done at maximum speed (up to
100 percent effort) to simulate the conditions of a race. The amount of
rest is usually very long, and allows the heart rate to approach the
resting rate. Because of the increased resistance encountered while
moving faster, sprinting gives you more muscle power and strength than
endurance; like repetition swimming, it also improves your anaerobic
capacity.

OMPONENTS OF A ORKOUT

--- Page 265 Text ---
All of the workouts are composed of three parts: the warm-up, the main
set, and the cool-down.
Warm-up: Swimming strenuously without being properly prepared
results in discomfort, a poor performance, and possibly injury. So initiate
each workout with a warm-up, which increases your body temperature
slightly, gets the blood flowing to where it will be needed, and begins to
raise your heart rate. Usually you should do some sort of warm-up on
land: for example, light calisthenics such as those suggested in
“Swimmers’ Shape-ups,” this page. (Many of these exercises may also be
done in shallow water, if you prefer.) If you have the time and
inclination, you may choose to do some more serious activity, such as
working out with resistance devices (freeweights, stretch cords, or
Nautilus or Universal weight machines) or some light jogging, before a
swim.
Regardless of what you do on land, there’s always a water warm-up of
some sort—when you just swim in an easy, relaxed manner. This not
only raises your body temperature, it also gets you in “the groove” for
swimming, the way pitchers throw a few practice balls, tennis players
rally, and singers practice the scale before plunging into the real thing.
To make the warm-up interesting, you can, for example, break it up into
several pull, kick, swim sets. The point is to ease the body into the main
set of the workout. The warm-up should take at least five minutes, or
about 20 percent of the total workout time or distance, whichever is
greater.
Main Set: This is usually a swimming set (meaning that you use your
arms and legs together), and should be the most demanding part of the
workout. Most main sets consist of one long set or several subsets with
short breaks between. Advanced swimmers might do these against the
clock (interval or repetition swims) to get their heart rate up to 70
percent of their maximum. Sometimes a main set consists of a marathon
swim; in this case the heart rate doesn’t get all the way up to 70 percent,
but you improve your endurance. The duration of the main set will vary

--- Page 266 Text ---
according to the overall workout, but, in general, it is at least 50 percent
of the total time/distance.
Cool-down: This consists of a few laps at the end of the workout to
relax and loosen the body. It’s also a way of letting your heart rate
return gradually to your resting rate. A cool-down is about 10 percent of
the total workout, or about half the distance of the warm-up. You might
want to add a post-cool-down on land. This should consist of gentle
static stretches to keep your muscles loose. (See “Swimmers’ Shape-ups,”
this page, for suggestions.)
HEART-RATE PATTERN DURING A TYPICAL SWIMMING WORKOUT
Transitions: At higher levels, where you are swimming longer
distances, some coaches add two transitional stages to the workout.
When used, each transition accounts for about 10 percent of the total
workout. The first comes between the warm-up and the main set, and

often consists of pulling in a descending fashion. For example, you might
do 5 × 50 (50 yards/meters five times), where each 50 is pulled faster
than the previous one. In this way, by the end of the pulling set you
have gradually brought your heart rate up to 70 percent of maximum
(the target rate), thus completing the warm-up process and setting
yourself up for the more strenuous work of the main set.
The second transition comes between the main set and the cool-down.
This transitional phase should be less demanding than the main set, both
psychologically and physiologically. It usually consists of a kicking set.
After the main set, your arms are probably tired, but there should still be
plenty of energy in your legs. Occasionally, the end of a workout can
include something challenging, like a timed sprint. This sprint shouldn’t
be done every day, though: if it becomes a habit it will get boring, and
besides, your body needs time to recover. When done, it should be
followed by a few easy laps.

ORKOUT ERMS
As you progress from phase to phase, you’ll also begin to learn a new
language—the language of swimming. Like all sports, swimming has its
special terms and verbal shortcuts. Here are a few to get you started.
Distance Notation: The first new terminology you’ll need in the
workouts is the most basic: how distances are indicated. For instance:
1 × 50 means swim 50 yards or meters 1 time
2 × 50 means swim 50 yards or meters 2 times (with a rest after
each 50)
1 × 100 means swim 100 yards or meters
Pulling, or using the arm motion without kicking, helps you learn or
practice a stroke and to build upper body strength. Pulling drills are
good for your warm-up. Mixed with kicking and swimming laps, they
can add variety to your main set, too. During pulling drills, you can use
training devices such as pull-buoys to help support your lower body, or

--- Page 268 Text ---
hand paddles and/or “donuts” to improve your technique and to
increase the resistance.
Kicking means using only the leg motion of a stroke. Recently there’s
been some debate as to how much of it should be done and where in the
workout it should come. On the one hand, the arms—not the kicking—
should generate most of the power of the stroke. On the other hand, it’s
important to practice your kicking, since it’s central to the stability,
timing, and coordination of your stroke, and to the development of your
stomach and chest muscles, and your legs. Since the legs contain large
muscles, they require a great deal of oxygen; therefore, kicking hard
during a workout helps to improve your cardiovascular efficiency. So
kicking is important, but more so in training than when you’re
swimming normally. Also, kicking is often used as a transitional set
between the main set and the cool-down. You can do kicking drills and
use training devices such as swim fins and kickboards to help you learn
or improve a kick, or increase in strength and power.
Pull-Kick-Swim Set: Here you pull the first lap, kick the next lap,
swim (use arms and legs together) for the last lap. By isolating each
component first, you refine and improve the whole stroke.
Controlled Breathing: As you improve your cardiovascular fitness you
may need to take fewer breaths as you swim the freestyle. In the
freestyle, inhaling on every third pull is called bilateral breathing. By
breathing on both sides and by taking fewer breaths you may improve
the efficiency of your strokes.
When you take fewer breaths as you swim, you increase your body’s
ability to function efficiently with less oxygen. By training your body to
do more with less, you increase your cardiovascular fitness and your
ability to get a “second wind.” In the freestyle, controlled breathing is
usually introduced by inhaling on every third pull (bilateral breathing)]
eventually you can work your way up to swimming an entire lap without
inhaling.

--- Page 269 Text ---
Broken Swims: These are timed swims that are interrupted by short
rests of a specified length (e.g., ten seconds). After completing the entire
swim, you subtract the total resting time from the final time to
determine your swim time.
Build-ups: In this training technique, you begin each lap slowly and
gradually build up speed as you reach the wall. This allows you to
establish your technique and maintain it as you build up speed.
Crescendo Set: This is several swims of regularly increasing distances
(for example: 1 × 25, 1 × 50, 1 × 75).
Pyramid Set: This is several swims of regularly increasing, then
regularly decreasing, distances. (For example, 1 × 25, 1 × 50, 1 × 75,
1 × 50, 1 × 25.) This is also known as an ascending/descending set.
Stroke Counting: Here you count the number of strokes needed to
complete a certain distance (usually one lap, or 25 yards/meters), then
try to lower the count the next time you swim it (while maintaining your
speed). Do a stroke count periodically to check your improving
efficiency and power.
Paced Swims: Try this so that you don’t go all out during the first half
of your swim and fade out toward the end. By timing yourself for both
halves of a swim, and approximating the same time for each, you get a
feel for pacing yourself. This is known as even splitting. If the second half
is faster than the first, it’s called negative splitting; you can do this by
concentrating on your pulling in the beginning and gradually increasing
the intensity of your kicking. You can apply this principle to all swims
100 yards/meters and longer. Pacing yourself also gets you accustomed
to reading the clock while you swim and thus prepares you for interval
swimming.

--- Page 270 Text ---
Pulse Rates and Pulse Check: Checking your pulse immediately after a
main set or timed swim is one way of determining whether you’re
overdoing it or not doing enough. It will eventually be a way of
measuring your progress, because the lower your resting rate the more
efficient your cardiovascular system.
To take your pulse, press the inside of your wrist firmly with the
fingertips of the other hand. (Using the thumb will not give you an
accurate reading, because it has its own pulse.) Or feel for your pulse on
your throat, just below the angle of the jaw. Count the beats for 6
seconds; then add a 0 to the end to give you the per-minute rate.
First take your resting rate, which is best done in the morning before
you’ve exercised or drunk any coffee (caffeine stimulates the heart and
would influence the reading). Write it down somewhere (perhaps in the
spaces allocated in the workouts, or in your Swimmers’ Log). The
average resting rate is 72 beats per minute, but athletes’ pulse rates are
often lower.
Next, calculate your maximum heart rate (MHR). To approximate this,
subtract your age from a base of 220. Therefore, if you are thirty-five
years old, your MHR will be about 185. The next figure to be concerned
with is your target rate (TR). To calculate your TR, multiply your MHR
by approximately 70 percent. So, if your MHR is 185, your TR would be
about 130. To improve your cardiovascular capacity, your heart rate
should average your TR during the main set of your workout.
Be aware that, as you train and improve your cardiovascular
conditioning, it will take more effort (i.e., you’ll have to swim faster) to
obtain your target heart rate.
Recent research indicates that your heart rate may be lower in the
water compared to exercising on land by 10 to 15 percent.
Timed Swim and Pulse Check: For this, you time yourself as you swim
a particular distance, comparing your performance to your previous
times. Afterward, you check your pulse rate to see if you have
approached your 70 percent target rate (usually you do this by
swimming fast, but not “all out”—the latter would elevate your pulse to
100 percent of its maximum rate, which is rarely desirable). A timed
swim in conjunction with a pulse check gives you a feel for what

--- Page 271 Text ---
working at this level of effort is like. You also get accustomed to
referring to the clock, which will figure into your workouts more and
more as you progress. (All swims, except for warm-ups, cool-downs, and
other specified easy swims, should be done at an average of about 70
percent effort.) You can do a timed swim (with or without a pulse check
afterward) during any workout; it should be near the end of the main set
so that you’re nicely warmed up for a fast swim. Timing yourself lets you
see the progress you’re making, makes the workout more interesting,
and helps you determine your time interval for interval swims.

The workouts will improve your fitness gradually and safely. But won’t
just swimming a little farther each time do that? Yes, but that would be
boring.
In these workouts, on the other hand, you’ll be doing a variety of
strokes; you will alternately swim (use your arms and legs together), pull
(use only your arms), and kick (use only the legs); you’ll swim varying
distances; in addition, you’ll be using different pieces of equipment. All
this adds up to a tremendous variety. And as you progress you can swim
against the clock (intervals, repeats, sprints, paced swims) to make
things even more interesting.
The workouts on the following pages do this, and more: they are also
learning workouts during which you may add to your repertoire of skills.
(If you’re not up to learning a new skill, substitute practicing something
you do know and want to improve in order to get the same amount of
working out.) But if you want to learn something new, it’s there for you
to take advantage of, presented in a logical sequence and in the context
of a workout that contains other related skills to make learning easier
and more understandable.
R W
EMEMBERING THE ORKOUTS
The more involved you become in swimming, the more you’ll realize
that it’s a mental as well as physical discipline. Swim teams are lucky

--- Page 272 Text ---
enough to have a coach telling (yelling at!) them exactly what to do for
every phase of their workout—and, in addition, the day’s workout may
be written on a large blackboard near the pool. For those of you who are
following these workouts solo, it’s a different story: you don’t have
anyone to rely on except yourself.
The simplest solution is to memorize the workout. To do this, read it
over several times before you go to the pool. Go over every one of the
exercises, drills, and swims in your head. The purpose here is to
remember the workout. If any new skills are involved, be sure to
practice them on dry land first so that by the time you get to the water
you’re pretty well familiar with them.
If you have a swimming buddy, you can help each other to remember.
If memorizing the workouts doesn’t come easily to you, there are
several alternatives. First, you could enclose the entire book in plastic
and take it to the pool with you. (The clear zip-up bags used to store
food are ideal for this.)
Better yet, you could rewrite the day’s workout on a small piece of
paper. Use a heavy pencil or a ballpoint pen and, at the pool, dip the
paper into the water and slap it either onto the wall just above the water
line or on the deck. (Wetting it keeps the paper from flying away, and
the ink doesn’t run as much as you’d expect.)
Or you could write each workout on an index card, then, for instant
waterproofing, simply return the card to the plastic wrapper that the
pack came in. You could also make each workout waterproof by
encasing the card in transparent plastic with a self-stick, peel-off
backing. A fringe benefit of this method is that you’ll end up with your
own set of permanent workout cards that you can take with you
anywhere.
W T R
ORKOUT IPS AND EMINDERS
If the specified distances for the continuous swims are too long
for you at first, swim as far as you can, gradually increasing the
distance each time you do the workout until you can swim the
specified distance without stopping.
If you find that the specified rests are more than you need,

--- Page 273 Text ---
decrease them accordingly.
Try to swim at least three times a week, and repeat each
workout at least three times, preferably every other day, before
progressing to the next level. If you begin a new workout every
week, it will take you approximately two and a half to three
months to complete each phase of your fitness program and to
advance to the next phase. At that rate, if you start the program
as a Beginner, by the end of about a year you will have
progressed through the Super Swimmer phase.
To learn or refine a new skill, practice the motions on dry land
before you get to the pool (they’re explained in “The
Techniques of Swimming,” this page. And once you’ve learned
them, you should generally incorporate them into your
swimming from then on. For instance, once you’ve learned the
S-pattern crawl stroke, the body roll, or the flip turn, use them
whenever you swim.
Use the different training concepts to create your own workouts
and to add variety to your swims. For instance, use Fartlek
training during a long swim; or do a pull-kick-swim series
instead of just swimming; or time yourself; or do a stroke count
periodically.
If you’re swimming every day, try to avoid doing the same kind
of workout. For example, about twice a week concentrate on
practicing skills and techniques that you know need
improvement. (Refer to the checklists and the catalog of
common errors found in “The Techniques of Swimming” and do
the suggested drills.) On other days, go for quantity as well as
quality.

HO’S A EGINNER?
You’re a Beginner swimmer if you:
Can swim 10–25 yards/meters without stopping and using any
combination of strokes.
Know at least “The Fundamentals of Swimming” taught in Part
One of this book (crawl stroke, elementary and windmill
backstrokes, treading, sculling, sitting and kneeling dives).
If you are a more advanced swimmer, you can still use these workouts
when, for some reason, you can’t follow your regular workout.

EGINNER KILLS AND ERMS
The crawl stroke term is used starting in the Beginners’ workout. With
each progressive workout and phase, you will be refining these
techniques. This refined crawl stroke is popularly termed “freestyle” and
therefore the terms “crawl” and “freestyle” are often interchangeable.
In these workouts you’ll practice the following skills (explained in
“The Techniques of Swimming”) and use the following terms (explained
in “Workout Terms,” this page):
S-pattern crawl/freestyle arm motion
Windmill backstroke body roll
Sidestroke

--- Page 275 Text ---
Breaststroke
Open turns for crawl and backstroke
Crescendo set
Your level of fitness will improve with each workout:
You’ll be swimming longer and longer distances without
stopping (from 25 yards/meters in Level 1 to 75 yards/meters
in Level 10).
You’ll get gradually less rest between swims (from one minute
in Level 1 down to 30 seconds).
You’ll be swimming longer total distances (from 100
yards/meters in Level 1 to 300 yards/meters in Level 10).
Each workout begins at the shallow end of the pool and lasts about 30
minutes, depending on how fast you swim. About half the workout time
is devoted to the warm-up and cool-down combined, and half to the
main set, which is the most strenuous. The warm-up is about 10
minutes, the main set is about 15 minutes, and the cool-down is 5
minutes. The warm-ups usually include some Swimmers’ Shape-ups (see
this page), which may be done on dry land or in the shallow end of the
pool; it also includes shallow-water practice of any skills highlighted in
the workout. The cool-down also usually includes a few Swimmers’
Shape-ups, which may be done in the shallow end of the pool or on dry
land.
S T B S
PECIAL IPS FOR EGINNING WIMMERS
Notice that when a specific stroke is highlighted the total
distance swum doesn’t increase. The distance is held steady so
you can devote your energies toward learning and practicing
the new skill.
Ideal pool size is 20 or 25 yards/meters. If the length differs
much, alter the workouts accordingly. First, find out how long
the pool is by checking the pool markers (or ask the lifeguard,
pool manager, or other swimmer). Otherwise, the handiest way

--- Page 276 Text ---
to approximate the length is by pacing it off; walk the length,
placing one foot directly in front of the other, and count each
pace as one foot. Then divide the number by three to get the
approximate yardage. Once you have the yardage, adjust the
workouts accordingly. For instance, if the pool is 15 yards long,
you can just double the number of laps: for a 25-yard swim, do
two laps, or 30 yards. If it’s a much longer pool, determine the
25-yard mark and stop there to rest before resuming the
workout.
If there’s no clock with a second hand, or you don’t have a
waterproof wristwatch you can approximate your rest times by
counting off the seconds in your head.
T V W
O ARY THE ORKOUTS
If you choose to stay at the Beginner level, or to take longer to
progress to the Intermediate phase, you’ll be repeating each workout
more than three times. In order to add more variety to them:
Begin to use some of the equipment described in that level.
Choose different Swimmers’ Shake-ups (see this page) for
warm-ups and cool-downs.
Add more distance to the main set (but not to exceed a total of
forty-five minutes in the water). You might even repeat the
entire main set.
Change the pace over the course of the workout. Each workout
lasts approximately twenty-five to thirty minutes. Leave the
warm-up and cool-down intact, but vary your speed during the
main set; take longer or shorter rests between laps.
Stress the skills that you need to brush up on. Ask a friend to
help you check your form. Don’t hesitate to go back and repeat
an earlier workout in order to review certain skills.
Try to increase the amount of continuous swimming you do.
Aim for 300 consecutive yards/meters for each stroke that you
know.
If you get really itchy for a change, it’s a definite sign that you

are ready to go on to the Intermediate phase, which will add to
your skills and improve your fitness even more.

INTERMEDIATE WORKOUTS
W I ?
HO’S AN NTERMEDIATE
You’re an Intermediate swimmer if you:
Can swim at least 75 yards/meters without stopping.
Know the skills taught in “The Fundamentals of Swimming”
(crawl stroke, elementary and windmill backstrokes, treading,
sculling, sitting and kneeling dives), plus the skills and terms
included in the “Beginners’ Workouts”: S-pattern crawl-stroke
arm motion, windmill backstroke body roll, sidestroke,
breaststroke, open turns for the crawl and backstroke,
crescendo set. If you need to, learn or review these skills before
beginning the following workouts.
I S T
NTERMEDIATE KILLS AND ERMS
As an Intermediate swimmer, you’ll practice these skills (explained in
“The Techniques of Swimming”) and become more familiar with the
terms (explained in “Workout Terms” and “Training Concepts”):
Backstroke start
Butterfly stroke
Crawl/freestyle body roll
Individual Medley (IM)
Stroke counting
Stroke drills for learning and practicing skills

--- Page 291 Text ---
Using equipment to isolate movements and/or increase
resistance, in order to improve your technique and increase
your strength
Pull-kick-swim series and variations: kick-swim series, pull-
swim series, kick-swim-kick series
Timed swim and pulse check
Pyramid sets—ascending/descending
Your fitness will continue to improve:
You’ll progress from swimming 50 consecutive yards/meters in
Level 1 to 250 yards/meters in Level 10.
You’ll get less rest between swims.
Your total workout distance will increase from 300
yards/meters in Level 1 to 1,000 yards/meters in Level 10.
Each workout lasts between thirty and forty-five minutes, depending
on how fast you swim, and on how long and how often you need rest.
The warm-ups include some Swimmers’ Shape-ups, which may be done
on land or in shallow water, and to which you might want to devote
more time on your own; the warm-ups also include dry-land or shallow-
water practice of any new skills highlighted in the workout. It’s also
advisable to add some stretches from the Swimmers’ Shape-ups to your
cool-down.
Since Levels 1–5 highlight a number of skills during the warm-up, the
distances actually swum in this part of the workout are shorter than they
ordinarily would be. During Levels 6–10, though, the warm-up distances
become increasingly longer because the number of review skills
decreases. By Level 10, you’ll be doing 150 yards/meters as a warm-up,
and 50 yards/meters as a cool-down, with 800 yards as a main set.
S T I S
PECIAL IPS FOR NTERMEDIATE WIMMERS
By now make the effort to swim in a 20-or 25-yard/meter pool.
Since the workouts are based on a 25-yard/meter lap, alter the
workout slightly if your pool measures only 20 yards/meters:

--- Page 292 Text ---
swim 1 × 20 instead of 1 × 25; 1 × 40 (two laps) instead of 1
× 50; and 1 × 80 (four laps) instead of 1 × 75. For 1 × 100
swims, you can swim five laps instead of four to obtain the
same total. (Make similar adjustments if your pool is a different
size.)
If you’re in a long-course (50-meter) pool, you’ll be making
fewer turns and so getting a more strenuous workout.
Therefore, if you need to, arrange to swim in an outside lane,
which will enable you to stop and rest mid-lap, especially
during 25-or 75-yard/meter swims. Another thing—most long-
course pools do not have an end shallow enough to allow you
to practice skills. If this is the case in your pool, practice new
skills first on dry land as best you can, or try to find a pool
more suitable for such practice.
If you’ve no clock or watch with a second hand, approximate
the seconds by counting to yourself, or by bobbing at the rate of
one bob per second; get a feel for the rhythm by practicing with
a clock first. If you do timed swims, though, you need a more
accurate way of measuring time.
If you find that you’re having trouble with a new stroke at first,
substitute another, more familiar one (such as the
crawl/freestyle) for part of the swim. But don’t forget about the
new stroke completely.
The Individual Medley is a combination of the four competitive
strokes in a particular sequence. Here’s how I remember the
order: First you do the butterfly, which takes the most energy;
then you turn over to do the backstroke because you’re dying
for air from the butterfly; next comes the breaststroke to let you
rest and stretch some more if you need to; then you end with
the fastest stroke, the crawl/freestyle.

O ARY THE ORKOUTS
If you decide to maintain your fitness at the Intermediate level, you’ll

--- Page 305 Text ---
probably want to vary the basic 1,000-yard/meter workout. In general,
you should follow the pattern established in Level 10:
Total distance: 1,000 yards/meters
Warm-up: 150 yards/meters (easy, relaxed swim) Main set:
800 yards/meters (variety of strokes, distances) Cool-down:
50 yards/meters (easy, relaxed swim)
Using these guidelines, you can mix and match strokes and skills:
In the warm-up, alternate different strokes: swim 50s of your
best stroke alternating with 25s of your worst.
Add drills to the warm-up to practice newly acquired skills or to
refine familiar ones (see “The Techniques of Swimming”). Add
pulling for more variety.
In the cool-down, use sculling or the elementary backstroke for
easy swimming, or tread in place, or use water exercises from
“Swimmers’ Shape-ups.” Add kicking for variety.
Repeat Levels 1-9, adding distance to bring each workout up to
a total of 1,000 yards/meters.
Do your IMs in reverse order.
Do a stroke count in all your strokes every once in a while—try
to lower your count.
If you haven’t been using any equipment, consider doing so.
On one day a week, or for one week, tackle a stroke or skill that
you’ve been avoiding or feel uncomfortable doing.
Do a timed swim and a pulse check occasionally.
Make up your own main sets consisting of a total of 800
yards/meters. (This is about half a mile, so why not begin to log
your distance either in your own personal log—see Appendix D
—or on the American Red Cross 50-mile log that’s posted at
many pools?) Here are ten sample 800-yard/meter main sets to
get you going:
1. 2 × 200 crawl/freestyle

ADVANCED WORKOUTS
W A S ?
HO’S AN DVANCED WIMMER
You are an Advanced swimmer if you:
Can swim at least 200 yards/meters without stopping.
Know “The Fundamentals of Swimming” (crawl stroke,
elementary and windmill backstrokes, treading, sculling, sitting
dive), the skills and terms taught in the “Beginners’ Workouts”
(S-pattern crawl/freestyle-stroke pull, windmill backstroke with
body roll, sidestroke, breaststroke, kneeling dive, open turns for
the crawl/freestyle and backstroke, crescendo swim) plus the
skills and terms taught in “Intermediate Workouts” (butterfly
stroke, backstroke in-the-water start, crawl/freestyle stroke
with body roll, pull-kick-swim series, timed swim and pulse
check, Individual Medley (IM), stroke counting, pyramid series.
If necessary, learn or review these skills and terms before you
begin this phase.
A S T
DVANCED KILLS AND ERMS
In this phase, you’ll learn these new skills (explained in “The Techniques
of Swimming”) and terms (explained in “Workout Terms” and “Training
Concepts” (see this page/this page).
Bilateral breathing patterns for crawl/freestyle
Alternate breathing pattern for butterfly

--- Page 310 Text ---
Backstroke bent-arm pull
Crawl/freestyle and breaststroke in-the-water starts
Closed crawl/freestyle turn
Standing dive
Easy/hard (Fartlek) swims
Interval training
Paced swims
Here’s how your fitness will improve:
You’ll progress from swimming 200 continuous yards/meters in
Level 1 to 400 yards/meters in Level 10.
You’ll get less rest between swims, and the rest you do get will
sometimes be determined by how fast you’ve just swum
(interval training).
Your total workout distance will increase from 1,000
yards/meters in Level 1 (approximately a half mile) to 1,800
yards/meters in Level 10 (approximately one mile).
Each workout will take about forty-five minutes, depending on how
fast you swim and how much rest you take.
The presentation here is more streamlined than in the previous phases.
For instance, there are no Swimmers’ Shape-ups indicated for the
warm-ups or cool-downs; add your own. And an “easy swim” means that
you may use the elementary backstroke, sculling, the sidestroke, or
whatever other stroke is relaxing for you.
S T A S
PECIAL IPS FOR DVANCED WIMMERS
If you’re not swimming in a 25-yard/meter pool, adjust the
workouts in the same manner as described for Intermediate
swimmers see this page).
As an Advanced swimmer, it’s important for you to have some
sort of clock or watch with a second hand that’s clearly visible.
The principles of pacing and interval training, borrowed from
competitive swimming, are good concepts for you to put to use

--- Page 311 Text ---
at this level. Even though you may be swimming relatively
slowly, it’s not too early to begin to keep a record of your times
—this gives the workouts more shape, and gives you another
set of goals to reach for.
The interval swims are based on the ability of the average fitness
swimmer at this level, who can easily swim 50 yards in about 1
minute. Since in this phase resting time should approximate
swim time, the average interval (swim time plus resting time)
for 50 yards would be 2 minutes (“on 2:00”). If our time is at
least 10 seconds faster or slower, adjust the interval by
doubling your own time. If you swim a 50 in 45 seconds, your
interval would be 1:30. If you hold that time for each 50-yard
swim, you get 45 seconds rest between them. As you become
able to swim faster you’ll be getting more and more rest at that
interval and so should reduce your overall interval accordingly.
Eventually, you may want to make your resting time shorter
than your swim time. (Competitive swimmers’ rest times are
often far less than their swimming times.) In addition, a meter
pool is 10 percent longer than a yard pool, so the intervals
would also be 10 percent longer. If your pool is a different size,
adjust your intervals accordingly.
Swim, kick, and/or pull drills in the warm-ups and cool-downs
should be done at an easy pace.
Use equipment such as hand paddles, pull-buoys, and fins to
isolate the movements and to help you increase the power of
your stroke.
Try not to rest during the workout except where indicated—
gradually reduce your rest each time you repeat a workout.
Consider joining a swim club or taking part in organized
workouts. Many coaches allow noncompetitive fitness-minded
swimmers to join in their team’s practices. If you do work out
with serious swimmers, make sure you’re familiar with the
appropriate terms, concepts, and pool courtesies beforehand.
Often there are lanes designated for faster and for slower
swimmers. The lifeguard or coach may ask you to swim in the
slower lane. Or you can judge where you should swim by
comparing the other swimmers’ times, intervals, and distances

--- Page 312 Text ---
with your own. The coach may also suggest ways to adapt the
workout to your own level and ability. For example, you might
do every other interval that the team does (if you do this, make
sure to stand to the right of the lane, so that the other
swimmers may turn.)
Another tip is to stop swimming when the other members of the
workout have stopped swimming, whether you’ve finished the
series or not. Just finish your lap, then go on to begin the next
along with the rest of the swimmers.

SUPER WORKOUTS
W S S ?
HO’S A UPER WIMMER
You are a Super swimmer if you:
Can swin at least 400 yards/meters without stopping.
Know all the skills and terms that an advanced swimmer knows
(see this page-this page).
Want to compete—or be in the same terrific shape that
competitive swimmers are in.

UPER KILLS AND ERMS
These workouts will fine tune the skills explained in “The Techniques of
Swimming” and increase your vocabulary of swimming terms (see
“Workout Terms,” and “Training Concepts,” pages 232 and 228:
Racing dive
Descending and/or ascending timed interval sets
Flip turn
Controlled breathing
Grab start
Even splits
Time trials
Build-ups
Your fitness will improve:

--- Page 326 Text ---
You’ll progress from swimming 400 yards/meters to 1,000
yards/meters.
Your total workout distance will increase from 1,800
yards/meters to 3,000 yards/meters.

PECIAL IPS FOR UPER WIMMERS
Include your own Swimmers’ Shape-ups in your warm-ups and
cool-downs. Resistance training (see this page) is
recommended, especially on the days that you don’t swim.
Reading the clock and pacing will be even more important here
than during the Advanced Phase. Now that you’re doing longer
distances—and maybe competing—you should develop a sense
of your speed and be able to control it.
You’ll notice that there will be “swim downs” during the main
set—because you’ll be swimming faster and more strenuously,
you will need this rest, but don’t swim so slowly here that you
cool down too much.
There will also be transitional sets to bring you into and out of
the main set. There’s usually a pulling set at the end of the
warm-up to get your stroke going and a kicking set just before
the cool-down because, although your arms will probably be
tired by this point, you will have some strength left in your
legs.
Training devices are recommended at this phase of your fitness
program to help to develop your strength.
Follow the tips suggested in the Advanced Workouts (this
page–this page) if you swim in organized workouts or use
anything other than a 25-yard pool.
The crawl stroke will be called the freestyle. (Although in
competition the term “freestyle” means any stroke that you
want, virtually all swimmers choose the crawl for these events.)
“Easy swim” means either a less strenuous stroke, such as
sculling or the elementary backstroke, or any other stroke that
you choose to swim slowly.
Adjust all timed interval swims according to your own speed

--- Page 327 Text ---
(see this page).
All warm-ups are approximately twice the length of the cool-
downs. Both of these should be easy swims, and can incorporate
stroke/kick drills.

WIMMING TO WIN
“S , T Y M !”
WIMMERS AKE OUR ARKS
“Why am I here? What do I need this for? I thought swimming was
supposed to be fun, but I feel terrible … I’m going to be sick. I should
have gone to the bathroom … maybe I should go now. What if they start
the race without me? I hope I don’t make a false start; what if my
goggles slip off or fog up? I just know my bathing cap is going to fall
off … How many laps is this race? I wonder if this new suit looks okay. I
should have worn my lucky one—so what if it’s last year’s model and
falling apart. My lucky chain! Oh no, I forgot my lucky chain! That’s
okay, I’m going to beat that swimmer over there this time, anyway.
What if the timing system goes out of whack … just my luck—I’ll do my
best time and no one will know for sure and I’ll have to do it all over
again, and I’ll bet I won’t swim as fast as the first time … IM? What’s
that … let’s see fly, back, breast, free—or is it fly, breast, back,
free … or … uh-oh … I’d better concentrate, the starter is raising his
arm, the gun’s going to go off … this is it!…” BANG!
Something like that goes through my mind every time I’m on the
starting block, and if it sounds like fun to you … welcome to the world
of competitive swimming! Only true aqua-nuts need apply; but not all
aqua-nuts need compete. Advanced and Super fitness swimmers can
benefit from the more intense and varied workouts and training concepts
in this section, too. So I hope you’ll take at least a peek and discover
what goes on here.
“T S C R C ,” “W C ?”
HE MELL OF HLORINE, THE OAR OF THE ROWD OR HY OMPETE
As you may have gathered, I get very, very nervous before a race. When

--- Page 344 Text ---
I’m up on the starting block I usually ask myself, Why am I doing this?
Not only is no one paying me, but I’m investing my own time, money,
and energy to be here! For what?
Well, part of it is the discipline, the serious training that’s necessary if
you’re going to compete. It’s been a part of my life for just about as long
as I can remember. But the thing that’s most interesting to me is the race
against time—against the clock that measures your speed, and against
the calendar that measures your age. When I started swimming in the
Masters Program, in which adults nineteen and over compete against
swimmers in their own age group, I was almost thirty. Since then (and
now in my fifth decade), my times for the most part have steadily
improved! Theoretically, as you get older, you get slower. But I’m not
the only swimmer who’s beaten Father Time. This is one case where the
well-worn phrase “You’re not getting older, you’re getting better” really
does apply. (Or at least if you are getting older, you’re getting better at
the same time.) Time is so objective—there is just no arguing with it. I
compete in synchronized swimming, too, where one is judged according
to other people’s standards and tastes, but in racing, when the clock
stops, you know exactly how good you were—period. You can win a
race and still not be satisfied with your own time; or you can come in
last and be ecstatic at your performance.
Why you choose to compete, if you do, will depend on your particular
circumstances and personality. But the bottom line will probably be the
challenge … to test your abilities to the utmost … and then to improve
on them. You’ll find it an amazing “high” to swim competitively, though
it’s habit-forming—ask any chlorine junkie. Of course, it’s an even
greater high when you win. And don’t say that you couldn’t possibly
win. You can. It’s no pie-in-the-sky dream. Even if you don’t finish first,
you’ll still win—in one form or another—no matter what age or shape
you’re in. This is especially true if you swim for fitness as part of the
Masters Program, in which you’re matched against swimmers in your
own age bracket. But even when there are other swimmers on the
starting blocks, you are really swimming against yourself—and against
your previous best times, using the adrenaline-boosting tendency of
competition to help you.
There’s definitely something about performing under pressure, with
family, friends, and teammates rooting for you, that brings out the best

--- Page 345 Text ---
in some people. You may be able to draw on reserves that you never
knew you had. Having a competitive goal to strive for may give you the
incentive to drive yourself to see if you have “the right stuff”—to satisfy
that curiosity that almost all people have (but won’t always admit to)
about just how good they really can be.
So, if you’ve been lap swimming for a while and are doing a mile or so
during a workout, and you ask yourself, Where do I go from here? you
should consider competing. If you’re swimming that much, you “might
as well be getting some more out of it,” as one recent convert put it. You
have nothing to lose and everything to win!

HY OU HOULD OIN A WIM LUB
If you compete, you can swim either as part of a team or “unattached.” I
recommend that you join a swim club if at all possible. Here’s why. First
of all, it’s a great way to make steady friends with whom you share the
joys (and the woes!) of swimming. This sense of camaraderie, of
belonging to a team, is one of the best things about competitive
swimming. My Empire Masters Swim Team, in New York City, for
instance, has over one thousand members. One is a dermatologist;
another is an art dealer; there’s a fashion model and a swim coach; one
couple writes music in their Manhattan loft; and our club founder, Jim
Forbes, is, fittingly enough, a retired U.S. Coast Guard-licensed tugboat
captain. So not only do you meet many people, you have the opportunity
to enjoy many types of people. You can broaden your horizons while you
train your body. You also have a unique relationship with your
teammates—you train together, help one another over the rough spots,
and empathize with one another; but you may also be racing against
some of your own club members as well as swimmers from other teams.
Clubs enable you to whip your body into magnificent shape under the
watchful eye (and the barking voice) of a coach. Workouts may be
scheduled daily, and may include dry-land exercises such as running,
weight training, calisthenics, and drills in each competitive stroke. It’s
very much like the workouts you’ve been doing on your own, only more
intense. And perhaps at an earlier hour—some clubs meet as early as 6
SO that swimmers can have the pool to themselves. Some people
A.M.

--- Page 346 Text ---
travel for miles to work out at that insane hour. Why? As one club
member says, “Because it’s fun; and I need the discipline. I’d never push
myself that hard. I need someone telling me what to do, that I can do it.
To yell at me, ‘Go, go, go!’ or ‘Shut up and swim.’ ”
If you want to compete, call your local Masters group, Y, recreation
center, high school, college, or swim club to find a team to train with.

PECIAL IPS FOR OMPETITIVE WIMMERS
Swimmers who want to compete should take certain factors into
consideration when they train in order to make sure they’re swimming
their best.
Types of Events
First, you should have some idea of the event or events you’d like to
participate in. Here’s a sampling of a line-up for an average swim meet:
Freestyle events:
50 yards/meters
100 yards/meters
200 yards/meters
500 yards/400 meters
1,000 yards
1,650 yards/1,500 meters
Backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events:
50 yards/meters
100 yards/meters
200 yards/meters
Individual Medley events:
100 yards

--- Page 347 Text ---
200 yards/meters
400 yards/meters
Relay events (These events may mix various ages, sexes,
distances, and strokes): 200 yards/meters
400 yards/meters
800 yards/meters
Open or “freestyle” events: Usually 200 yards/meters in stroke
of your choice. There are also longer distances and marathon
events both poolside and in open water.
As you’ll see later, the way you train will depend in part on the types
of races you will swim.
A Swimmer for All Seasons
There are two main competitive swimming seasons: the indoor (short
course, or 25-yard/meter pools), which usually occurs October to May,
and the outdoor (long course, or 50-yard/meter pools), which occurs
June through September. Both of these seasons are classically divided
into three stages or parts, and each season culminates in your main
meet. Which part of the season it is and which event or events you
specialize in determine the kinds of workouts you do. Here is a
description of each part of the swimming season, as well as suggestions
for specialized workouts to be done at specific times to help you train
most effectively for your event.
As you train, fine tune your skills, paying careful attention to the
checklists and catalogs of common errors provided for each stroke in
Part Two, “The Techniques of Swimming.” Make sure you’re proficient
in those little extras that can make a crucial difference in your final
times: flip turns; open turns for the breaststroke and butterfly; wind-up,
grab, and relay starts. Chances are that the other swimmers will be using
them to advantage—so why shouldn’t you?
1. Early Season (approximately four to eight weeks): At this time,

--- Page 348 Text ---
concentrate on general conditioning, using long, easy swims and a
variety of strokes and distances up to two miles (such as those suggested
in the Super Workouts). In addition, I suggest that you supplement your
swimming with dry-land activities that will improve your strength,
flexibility, and cardiovascular conditioning—such as aerobics, stretching
and running, and exercises using stretch cords and weights. (See
“Swimmers’ Shape-ups,” this page.) Samples of early season workouts
begin on this page.
2. Mid-Season (six to twelve weeks): Your workouts should include a
relatively consistent yardage (about 3,000 yards/meters), and you
should begin to fine tune your strokes, particularly your specialty or
specialties. You should do some stroke work as well as some distance
and timed swims. Dry-land training should be held at maintenance level
during this time. You should also pay particular attention to your resting
and eating habits and your flexibility, and perhaps take vitamin and
mineral supplements (go easy on the junk-palace foods!). Typical mid-
season training workouts begin on this page.
3. Taper and Peak (average two weeks before your biggest meet):
This, the shortest part of the swimming season, is the time during which
you prepare yourself physically and mentally for your stiffest
competition. Generally the aim is to concentrate on higher-quality,
lower-quantity swimming. As you get nearer and nearer the actual race,
your total yardage decreases, but your times should approach racing
speed. You do this by resting more between sets, doing broken swims,
swimming descending sets, doing stroke drills, and practicing starts and
turns to improve technique.
The average taper lasts one to two weeks, but this depends on how
long and how hard you’ve trained during the rest of the season, and on
your event and distance specialty. The longer your event, the shorter the
taper. For example, a sprinter would taper about ten days, whereas a
distance swimmer’s taper might be only five days. Because of the taper,
you bring your mind and your body to peak performance. The length of
your peak may last about half as long as your taper. Suggested taper and

--- Page 349 Text ---
peak workouts begin on this page.
After your big race, you may experience a physical and mental
letdown. At this time you may want to take a break from your training.
Or you may want to abbreviate your workouts.

(I
concentrate on doing one or more strokes and/or distances really well
even if they never attend a single meet.
These workouts are about 3,000 yards/meters, and so will give you
plenty of ideas for varying the Super Workouts, too. The workouts are
organized to coincide with the three parts of a competitive season, and
include samples and training concepts for distance and marathon swims,
sprints, middle-distance swims, and for peaking and tapering.
When following the workouts, make sure that you adjust all intervals
to your own needs and capabilities. Don’t forget to take it easy during
the warm-ups and cool-downs, which are an important part of every
workout.

Distance, Overdistance, and Marathon Swims
Early in the season, concentrate on distance swims to build your
endurance. One good way to do this is a timed broken swim of 1,650
yards/1,500 meters; variations follow.
1. Timed Broken 1,650 yard/1,500 meter workout

--- Page 350 Text ---
Warm-up (800 yards/meters)
8 × 100 freestyle/swimmer’s choice:
2 × 100 easy swim
1 × 100 with paddles
1 × 100 with paddles and pull-buoy
1 × 100 with pull-buoys
1 × 100 catch-up freestyle
2 × 100 easy swim
Main Set (2,300 yards/2,150 meters)
2 × 300 (sustain pace of first 50 for entire set):
1 × 50; 5 seconds rest
1 × 100; 10 seconds rest
1 × 150; 15 seconds rest
Repeat
Rest as needed

(If you’re swimming in a long-course pool, this completes your
1,500-meter broken swim.) Variation (slightly shorter distance):
Divide swim into thirds (490 yards/450 meters) with a 30-
second rest interval after each third.

4. Circle Swimming
If you are in a small or irregularly shaped pool, or a small area of open
water, swim in a circle around the perimeter; change direction after half
your swim, and perhaps change your stroke. (Count your circles, if you
like.) To cool down, tread and/or swim easily for 5-10 minutes.
5. Open-water Swimming

--- Page 352 Text ---
Another way to get in your overdistance is to swim long stretches in
open water, such as a lake or the ocean. This can be most enjoyable.
Here the idea is to swim from one point to another at a steady pace. (It’s
also done as a competitive event for time or distance, such as in a
triathlon.) Warm up thoroughly on land, with jumping jacks, arm circles,
jogging in place, and easy stretching. Begin your swim at an easy, steady
pace for the first 1,000 yards/meters, or approximately fifteen minutes.
Concentrate on pulling.
As you continue into the main part of your swim, focus on the
following:
Keep a steady pace throughout the swim.
Periodically check your time and/or distance.
Swim in as straight a line as possible. Do bilateral breathing.
If you get tired or bored, or if you get a “stitch,” change strokes.
Think about your stroke techniques when your mind begins to
wander.
Heed the following open-water Safety and Comfort Tips:
Prior to your open-water swim, check tides, temperature,
currents, sea life, and salinity of the water.
If you’re in an open-water race, check the positioning at start.
Stay clear of other swimmers (unless you like contact
swimming).
Keep an eye on your swimming course, using buoys and
markers and/or other swimmers as guides.
Use alternate breathing to change your pace, check your
position, and relax your neck muscles.
If signs of impending hypothermia, or cooling of the body’s core
temperature, develop (such as blue or numb fingers), don’t be a
martyr.

Specialty Strokes, Distances, Individual Medley Workouts
During this part of your swim season you want to hold to a total distance
of approximately 3,000 yards/meters per workout and concentrate on
your specialty. The following two freestyle workouts are examples that
can be adapted to other strokes.
1. Sprint Freestyle: This includes a time trial to help you achieve the
“perfect 100”: suppress the kick on the first 50, and accelerate it for the
second 50.
Warm-up: (600 yards/meters)
6×50 pull on 1:00
4× 50 catch-up freestyle drill; alternate breathing on 1:00
4×25 body position drill on 1:00: prone position, head up; arms
extended forward underwater; scull as you flutter kick and keep
shoulders as high as possible.
Main Set: (2,100 yards/meters)
4 × 200 freestyle broken swim on 4:00; rest 10 seconds at 100
and 150; pull first 100
1 × 100 easy breaststroke
5 × 100 freestyle on 2:00; pull first 50
1 × 50 easy swim
10 × 50 descending set: time interval decreases by 2 seconds;
starting interval 1:00

1 × 50 easy swim; rest as needed
1 × 100 timed swim: to swim the “perfect 100,” try to pull the
first 50, suppressing the kick, then accelerate the kick during
the final 50. Record your time and make a pulse check.
Cool-down: (300 yards/meters)
6 × 50 easy kick-swim set
2. Middle-distance Freestyle: This workout includes a broken 200-
yard/meter swim during which you should approach your best time. To
get your final time, subtract your rest periods.
Warm-up: (600 yards/meters)
1 × 200 easy swim
4×50 catch-up one-arm pull on 1:00 (swim easily, so that you
just make the interval and get very little rest) 1 × 200 easy IM
Main Set: (2,100 yards/meters)
1 × 400
1 × 200 pull
1 × 200 swim
1 × 100 pull with pull-buoy at ankles (with paddles)
1 × 100 swim

--- Page 355 Text ---
1 × 100 swim
30 seconds rest
1 × 100 pull with pull-buoy above knees (with paddles)
1 × 100 swim
30 seconds rest
1 × 100 pull with paddles only
1 × 100 swim
Rest as needed
1 × 150 IM without freestyle (butterfly, backstroke, and
breaststroke only) 1 × 50 easy swim
1 × 100 flutter kick with fins
1 × 50 easy swim
Rest as needed
1 × 200 broken swim
1 × 100: concentrate on pull (rest interval: 10 seconds)
1 × 50: sprint
Check pulse.
Cool-down: (300 yards/meters)
2 × 150 easy pull, kick, swim
3. Butterfly Main Set: Do mixed swim sets, because the butterfly is
such a strenuous stroke. For example, you might break up a set of 150s
this way: 4×150 on 4:00:
first and third 150: 1 × 50 freestyle, 1 × 50 butterfly, 1 × 50
freestyle second and fourth 150: 1 × 50 butterfly, 1 × 50
freestyle, 1 × 50 butterfly
Add some dolphin-kick drills, some butterfly pulling, and some
controlled breathing drills to your workout, too.

--- Page 356 Text ---
4. Backstroke Main Set: You can also do descending sets and/or
negative splits during a main set (this is more appropriate for freestylers
and breaststrokers, than for butterfliers or IM specialists). For example:
2 × 200 backstroke on 3:30: negative split by swimming second half of
each 200 faster than the first half (glance at the clock when you make
the first 100) and/or:
6 × 50 backstroke swim, descending on 1:00: swim each 50 a second or
two faster than the previous one.
5. Breaststroke Main Set: One thing to concentrate on here is stroke
drills. Since there have been so many innovations in this stroke, most
swimmers’ breaststroke could use some technique work. For example,
you could begin the main set this way: 4 × 150 breaststroke drills (30
seconds rest between each 150):
1 × 150 pull with dolphin kick
1 × 150 pull-pull-kick drill
1 × 150 whip kick (keep hands at buttocks)
1 × 150 one-arm breaststroke drill
You could also add a descending set of 5 × 100, and some controlled
breathing swims to help your underwater pull-out.
6. Individual Medley Main Set: Here the trick is to swim all four
competitive strokes as a separate “event” in the workout, each event, or
set, being introduced with an IM swim. For instance, in an IM 4 × 450
main set of 2,100 yards/meters, the butterfly set might be:
1×450 on 11:00
1 × 200 IM on 4:00
1 × 100 dolphin kick on 2:30
2 × 50 butterfly on 1:30 (1 × 50 pull, 1 × 50 swim)
1 × 50 easy swim-down on 1:30
Repeat for the backstroke, breaststroke, and freestyle, beginning each
450-yard set with a 200 IM, followed by a kick drill, a pull-swim drill,
and a swim-down, as above, for each stroke. (Adjust the interval times if

--- Page 357 Text ---
needed.) For variations in your Individual Medley workouts, you can
also reverse the order of the IM (i.e., freestyle, breaststroke, backstroke,
butterfly). Also, in a 50-meter pool you can do 100 IMs by changing
strokes at the halfway mark.

A typical taper workout is about 2,000 yards/meters, with
approximately one third allocated each to the warm-up, main set, and
cool-down. Peak workouts are about 1,000 yards/meters, and are
divided up this way: two fifths warm-up, one fifth main set, and two
fifths cool-down.
1. Taper workout for middle-distance (200 yards/meters) swimmers:
This might include a timed broken 200-yard/meter freestyle swim. Be
sure to practice your starts and turns during the swim and add a few
practice drills at the end of the cool-down. Total Distance: 2,000
yards/meters
Warm-up (700 yards/meters):
3 × 200 easy pull-kick-swim, freestyle or swimmer’s choice
1 × 100 freestyle: catch-up stroke drill

OUR IRST WIM EET
Get Ready …
To find out where and when local meets are to be held, contact your
local Y, school swim team, or community center. You can also write the
U.S. Masters Swimming office or use the listings in one of the periodicals
listed, beginning on this page.
Once you’ve decided to enter a meet, the first thing you have to do is
become registered with U.S. Masters Swimming, Inc. Then get an official
entry blank from the sponsoring organization. Fill it out and sent it in as
instructed. There is usually a specified fee for each event you wish to
enter.
Be sure to enter events that you’re comfortable with. In addition to
your fitness level, consider the distance, stroke, and the spacing of
events. For example, for your first meet you should choose events near
the beginning and end of the schedule, so that you’ll have plenty of rest
in between.
For your first meet, you should probably enter one to three individual
events. Next time you can enter more if you feel up to it. And remember,
you don’t have to swim even if you’ve entered; you can change your
mind at the last minute. But sending in your entry is a commitment, and
most people who enter actually compete.
A few days before the race you’ll probably experience pre-meet jitters.
This is a phenomenon that affects almost everybody—young or old, new
or experienced. I still get them, and I’ve been competing for forty plus
years. So don’t be surprised if you feel anything from a few butterflies in
your stomach to all-out nervous diarrhea.
You may begin to feel unsure of yourself. You’ll hear yourself saying,

--- Page 360 Text ---
Oh, God, I feel so out of shape. I’m sick. I feel paralyzed. Why am I
doing this? Here I am spending another perfectly good Saturday at the Y.
All my friend and family think I’m crazy—maybe they’re right.
This time your teammates come in really handy. An understanding
spouse, friend, or relative can help, too. Lucky for me, I come from a
swimming family—my mother, father, brother, and sisters all swim.
Invite your family to the meet, whether they’re swimmers or not, so that
they can give you support. Nothing will give you a bigger kick than
having your own rooting section.
Of course, you’ll be more confident if your body has been trained,
tapered, and peaked properly. But have you trained your mind? The best
athletes know that mental preparation is one of the most important parts
of any training program. You’d be surprised at the difference the state of
your psyche can make in your performance.
To help improve performance, many swimmers use mental imagery,
imagining beforehand every second of an upcoming race: the pool, the
crowd, the lane markers, the starting block, the signal go, the feel of the
water, their first stroke, their breathing pattern, their turn, and so on
until the end of the race, where they win (or swim their best time). This
mental practice can also be used during workouts (just before a sprint or
a timed swim). Like a dancer or an actor, you must rehearse the race
physically and mentally many times before the actual “performance,”
thinking through every lap, stroke by stroke and turn by turn, from start
to finish, until you’re sure you know every nuance of the race.
Get set …
On the day of the meet, it’s psychologically and logistically (and
sometimes ecologically) a good idea to travel with other people—
especially if they’re swimmers. (You’ll find sympathetic company
valuable.)
What to Take
In all the excitement, you might forget an item or two, so use this
checklist as a reminder. I find a large water-repellent duffel bag with

--- Page 361 Text ---
extra pockets ideal for carrying my paraphernalia.
A copy of your U. S. Masters Swimming Registration Card.
Bathing suits. Take one for warm-up and one racing suit for
each event in which you’ll be competing. Change into a dry suit
after each event.
Bathing cap, if you wear one (take an extra, just in case).
Goggles. Take two pairs.
Towels. Take at least two. (Chamois are great.)
Toiletries and grooming aids. Don’t forget your shampoo and
conditioner, baby oil, soap, cotton swabs, ear, eye, or nose
drops. Use plastic bottles for safety.
Plastic bags. To tote wet things home.
Lambswool or earplugs. If you need to keep water out of your
ears.
Sneakers, socks, warm-up suit, and T-shirts. To wear between
events, over your suit; helps to keep you from getting chilled.
Lock. For storing your valuables in a locker.
If you’re competing outdoors, take a hat, appropriate SPF
suntan lotion, sunglasses, maybe an umbrella to protect you
from the sun.
You might want to have team T-shirts printed up. Of course, T-shirts
(and bathing caps) can be made to say anything these days; my favorites
are my “excuse” T-shirts and caps, which give such tried-and-true
explanations as:
I put my earplugs in my nose
I thought it was the backstroke
The stopwatch didn’t work
I was saving something for the finals
My suit fell off
I tapered too much
I’m allergic to chlorine
My goggles leaked
It was a false start

--- Page 362 Text ---
You may want to take some healthful snacks like nuts, fruit, or juices
—you may find a snack bar, gratis buffet, or vending machines at the
meet, but you never know.
There will be a check-in post in the lobby or at poolside, where you
pick up the entry cards that you sent in earlier or a program, or heat
sheet. Your cards will now have been filled in with your heat, as well as
your lane number. The program indicates the order or events and heats,
the entrants, their age groups, and their seed times. These heats are
usually set up so that you swim with people close to your seed time.
Within each heat, the swimmers are arranged so that the fastest are in
the center lanes and the slower swimmers are in the outer lanes.
Next, proceed to the locker room. Locate the bathroom for future
reference, a locker, and change into your warm-up swim suit. If you
have long hair (this goes for guys, too) secure it with an elastic band
before you put on your bathing cap; if your cap shifts during the race,
this will keep your hair from falling in your eyes. Remove all jewelry.
In most cases, it’s best to lock your valuables in the locker and to keep
out only what you need—extra suits, towels, sweat suit, etc. Leave the
essentials in your bag and take it poolside with you.
Next, do a warm-up and check out the pool. Get in the water and
loosen up with a few laps. As you do so, see how “fast” the pool is.
Check the wall of the pool; some may be slippery and others may cause
the water to splash up in waves as you turn. Is the pool wavy? If so, it
may affect your comfort and speed. If the backstroke is one of your
events, count the number of strokes it takes you to go from the overhead
flags to the wall. See whether touch pads for electronic timing are in
place against the wall, just under the starting block.
If so, be sure to touch the pad strongly when you finish, so that it
stops your time. (There are usually back-up hand timers just in case.)
Take a few practice dives to test the starting blocks. If you’re in a relay,
practice a few exchanges with your teammates. Goggles are optional
during a race. For a longer distance, you may even want to use an in-the-
water start so that you don’t risk your goggles slipping off. However, if
you tighten them up and keep your chin tucked on entry, they should be
fine.
The pre-race warm-up should bring your pulse up the same way it
does during a workout. It should get you loose, stretched, and relaxed;

--- Page 363 Text ---
establish your breathing pattern; and warm up your stroke. If you’re in
shape and ready, a warm-up will not tire you out. On the contrary, it
will help get you going. If you’re not in your best shape, do an
abbreviated, easier warm-up.
A pre-race warm-up should begin with a long, easy swim, followed by
stroke drills, then by a set to bring your heart rate up. It should total
approximately 1,000 yards/meters (or about one third of your daily
yardage).
Here’s a sample pre-race warm-up:
1 × 200 easy swim
1 × 200 stroke and kick drills
1 × 200 pull
1 × 300 pace set: 6 × 50 on a comfortable interval; sprinters
should do faster interval, with build-up 50s 1 × 100 easy swim
Finish by practicing starts and turns. Diving starts are permitted
in designated sprint lanes, swimming only in one direction.
After warming up, go back to the locker room and change into a dry
racing suit. If you were a bit nervous before, warming up should have
calmed you down a bit (although you may find that your suit is awfully
difficult to get on!).
Go!
When it’s time for you to step onto the starting block, concentrate on
how you’re going to swim the race. Try to be relaxed but alert. Take a
few deep breaths to calm you down, but don’t overdo it.
During the race, concentrate on your actual performance. Try to swim
it exactly as you’ve planned; don’t let the presence of your competitors
cause you to deviate from your strategy. They may be ahead of you or
behind you—but who knows how they’ve planned to swim the race?
Try to get someone to note your intermediate times (your splits).
Usually the timer for your lane will do this if you ask, or have a friend

--- Page 364 Text ---
with a stopwatch take them for you. During longer races, such as 500s or
1,650s, lap counters will tell you (visually or orally) how many laps
you’ve completed.
After the race, whatever the results, stay in the water to cool down
and to allow your pulse to return to normal. If there’s a warm-up/cool-
down pool nearby, do a few easy laps. If not, do some bobbing, sculling,
or floating. It’s much better to cool down in the water. The cool water
will help disperse the extra body heat.
During the cool-down, think about your reasons for competing. You
may be disappointed this time, but there’s always a next time; no one
can be the best or even do his best at every meet. And remember that
the word “compete” comes from the Latin competere, meaning “to strive
together.” Most people assume that the idea is to strive against one
another, to put winning above all else. But if you think of swimming as a
constructive, creative activity that helps you develop as a person, that
mixes seriousness with fun, you’ll realize that, whatever the order of
finish, you have nothing to lose.

EQUIPMENT

--- Page 366 Text ---
A
ll you really need to swim is a pool, a suit, and perhaps a cap and
goggles. When used judiciously, though, the training devices described
here can help you to vary your workouts, refine your techniques, learn
new skills, and accelerate and intensify the conditioning process. They
can be invaluable in getting you over a hump or in surmounting a
plateau. They’re also fun to use—either alone or in the combinations
suggested. (Don’t get carried away and try to use everything at once!)
The pool where you work out may supply some training devices; if so,
they may be lying around pool-side. If you don’t see any, ask for them;
they may simply be stored away somewhere. If your pool doesn’t
provide basic equipment, you can always take your own. All of the
equipment discussed here can be found at a well-equipped sporting
goods store, but if an item isn’t available locally, contact one of the
supplier manufacturers listed at the end of this chapter. Sources of
information about swimming, the best books, periodicals, and films, are
listed there, too.
P
OOLS
All pools are definitely not created equal. A good pool is worth looking
for, paying for, and even traveling for. So carefully consider your needs,
preferences, and level of ability when selecting one. When you’re away
from home, you may not have much of a choice; but shop around for
your regular pool, keeping the following factors in mind.
Size: Pool sizes vary greatly. Let’s begin at the top, with the two sizes
that are the most desirable. First, there are the “long-course” pools.
These 50-meter (sometimes 55-yard) pools are common on the West
Coast, where they’re usually outdoors. Many universities throughout the
country also have indoor and outdoor long-course pools, though, and
they often allow community members to use them during certain hours.

--- Page 367 Text ---
In addition, private clubs with good facilities often house a 50-meter
pool complex and have a team that you can train with. Long-course
pools are terrific for intermediate, advanced, and competitive-level
workouts. They’re usually well designed and fully equipped with lane
markers for lap swimming, pace clocks, and training devices such as
kickboards, pull-buoys, and hand paddles. This is the only truly
“Olympic size” pool; anything shorter, no matter what advertisers may
claim, is not. (By the way, you should be aware that swimming in a
long-course pool is a different experience from swimming in a shorter
pool: it’s more strenuous because you have fewer turns and therefore
fewer rests.)
Next come the 25-yard, 25-meter, and 20-yard pools for competition.
However, although only the 25-yard and 25-meter pools qualify as
“regulation short course,” all these lengths are fine for any swimmer at
any level. (Beginning swimmers should make sure that there’s an area
that is shallow enough for practicing new skills, though.) You’ll find
pools in this group in many places—Ys, some health clubs, swim clubs,
public recreation areas, schools, park department facilities, etc. They
sometimes have lane markers, pace clocks, and various training devices.
You may also find 33⅓-yard/meter pools located in the above places as
well.
After these two groups, the sizing situation is a mess. The length of
hotel, motel, health club, and health spa pools often depends upon how
much space and money the owner has, and may be anything from 10 to
15 yards. These are fine when you’re at the beginner stage; since there’s
a large shallow end, it’s easy to swim the shorter laps or widths, and it’s
unlikely that there will be lap swimmers for you to dodge. As you
improve, though, you’ll probably outgrow this size pool fairly quickly.
But don’t forget swimming if that’s the only kind of pool that’s around:
you’ll still be able to swim mini-laps, do drills, practice starts and turns,
do some kicking and a variety of water exercises. You can also swim
around the perimeter of the pool, first counterclockwise, then clockwise.
Shape: Kidney-shaped pools are fine for beginners, for practicing
certain skills, and for water exercises, but persons who want to improve
their fitness by swimming longer distances won’t be satisfied in anything

--- Page 368 Text ---
but a standard-sized, rectangular pool.
Cleanliness: The pool and its surroundings should be spotless.
However, cloudy water doesn’t necessarily mean that the pool is dirty or
unsafe; it could just be a temporary chemical imbalance. (Generally, if
you can see the drain at the deep end, the water is clear enough for safe
swimming.) Inspect the wall at water level—if the pool has a case of
“ring around the collar,” it may mean that maintenance isn’t up to par.
All pools have a filtration system for recirculating the water and
balancing the chemicals; the lifeguard or pool manager can probably tell
you whether there are any problems there.
Indoors or Outdoors? If you can, by all means swim outdoors: it’s
much more pleasant when the sunlight is filtering through the water and
you’re breathing fresh air. And unless it’s a thunderstorm, there’s
nothing wrong with swimming even in the rain (just swim underwater if
you don’t want to get wet!). Depending on the climate in your area, you
may be able to swim outdoors all year round; if you live in a colder
climate, switching from indoors during the winter to outdoors during the
summer can provide a welcome change in your routine.
Traffic: While having the whole pool, or at least one lane, all to
yourself is nice, it’s hardly possible all the time. Observe pool courtesy
by circling counterclockwise within the lane and you’ll find that
crowding is not a problem. Of course, if there are hundreds of persons
splashing around, you might schedule your swims for less popular times.
There should be at least one lane marked off for lap swimming, if that’s
what you plan to do.
Also, when turning, wait at the wall, if at all possible, to allow a faster
swimmer to pass you. You’ll know that someone is eager to pass if you
felt a little toe tickle on the preceding lap.
Temperature: The ideal water temperature for comfort and safety is
between 78° F and 84° F For light workouts such as those done by

--- Page 369 Text ---
beginning swimmers, or for water exercises, water at the warmer end of
the scale is preferable. For heavier workouts, cooler water is better
because it helps dissipate your increased body heat. The American
National Red Cross recommends that the air temperature be about four
degrees higher than the water temperature.
Ambience: What’s your style: no-fuss, no-frills—or music, lush
vegetation, chairs for lounging, and fancy mirrors and murals? You want
to feel comfortable at your pool, so make sure that you like the
atmosphere at your chosen watering hole before you commit yourself
and your money. Remember, you’ll be spending about an hour there at
least three times a week. In addition to the ambience, you may also want
a well-equipped gym, exercise room, and/or whirlpool and sauna
facilities, under one roof.
Lifeguard: The presence of a qualified person in case of emergency is
something swimmers at all levels should insist upon. Never swim alone.

WIM UITS
We’ve come a long way since 1909 when Annette Kellerman, the
Australian national swimming heroine, was arrested for wearing a daring
one-piece tank suit. Looking and feeling like a woolly body stocking, her
suit would be considered a real drag (literally and figuratively) by
today’s standards—but it was a definite improvement over the fussy,
skirted monstrosities that women were wearing at the time. (Although
men’s suits have always been more practical and comfortable than
women’s, the fellows wore suits similar to Annette’s until the end of
World War II.) But Ms. Kellerman definitely had the right idea about
eliminating resistance. Since then, suits have become steadily lighter,
sleeker, and skimpier, in an effort to increase streamlining and reduce
swimming times.
The arrival of the aptly named skinsuit, worn by the East German
women’s team in the 1972 Olympics, generated a shock similar to that of

--- Page 370 Text ---
the Kellerman suit in its day. But a more serious shock was the record-
breaking times achieved by the swimmers who wore the contour-
revealing suits, and now these “disgraceful” suits that fit like a second
skin are commonplace on serious fitness swimmers and competitors
alike. They’re seen on recreational and fashion-conscious swimmers, too,
in the form of the comfortable and practical Lycra.
Men’s suit styles have also undergone a streamlining, from the
conservative wool tank suit, to the heavy cotton boxer shorts, and finally
to the Lycra “skin” bikini brief seen on serious competitive and fitness
swimmers today.
Almost any suit will do when you begin your program. But eventually
women should get rid of the excess fabric such as decorative bows,
buckles, buttons, and skirts, and men should graduate from baggy shorts.
These all create drag in the water and slow you down, making
swimming harder than it need be. So pare down to the minimum with a
suit that fits well without binding at the arms, legs, or waist. When
buying a suit, be sure to try it on. If you can, simulate swimming
movements in the dressing room to make sure it won’t slip or rub; you
won’t want to have to interrupt your workouts to adjust your suit every
lap or two. For women a one-piece tank or maillot-type suit is best.
Some well-constructed dance leotards also fit the bill, and many
sportswear manufacturers have designed suits that are hard to
distinguish from their inspirations—real racing suits.
Fitness and racing suits are available at sporting goods stores and are a
must for competitive swimmers, when an extra ounce or two can make a
crucial difference in the time. Even if you don’t compete (yet), consider
getting a suit designed for serious swimming. Why should you be held
back by a suit that’s one iota heavier than it has to be? A racing suit will
help you swim better. It has strategically placed straps that allow the
greatest possible freedom of movement. It’s sleek, taut, and practically
weightless. It gives your body a streamlined feel and allows you to slip
through the water more smoothly and quickly. In fact, while you’re
swimming you’ll probably forget that you’re wearing one.
Fitness and racing suits are available in seemingly endless variations.
There are numerous styles that affect their shape, style, back, straps, leg
height, type of fabric, thickness, design, and therefore prices will vary.
To prolong the life of any suit, avoid sitting on rough edges or

--- Page 371 Text ---
surfaces. Most manufacturers suggest that you rinse your suit out in
fresh water after each swim, and allow it to air-dry.
G
OGGLES
Goggles may not be the most attractive thing you’ll ever wear, but
they’re surely an improvement over “red eye.” And not only do goggles
protect your eyes, they help you to see better underwater. For contact
lens wearers, of course, goggles are a must. Prescription goggles are
available, as well.
Goggles come in various shapes, sizes, eye socket cushioning, anti-fog
features, variable adjustments for nosepieces and head straps, casing and
more.
Finding a comfortable pair of goggles is largely a matter of trial and
error. Manufacturers naturally try to design models to fit everyone, but
as this is impossible, you’ll just have to buy a pair and keep your fingers
crossed.
Goggles come in a variety of tints. Clear is the all-purpose color, and
the blue, green, or gray ones are made to shield your eyes from bright
sunlight. Yellow or rose-colored lenses, on the other hand, actually make
indoor light seem brighter.
When you wear goggles, get the proper fit by adjusting both the
rubber headband and the center piece over the nose. If you wear a cap,
the goggles should be over it. For diving and for fast flip turns, wear
your goggles a bit tighter than usual. The cushioning around the lenses
keeps the water out. To help form a tighter seal, press the goggles gently
against your eye sockets to help create a vacuum. The slight indentations
they leave around your eyes disappear quickly, but to minimize this
effect you can push the goggles up on your forehead whenever you don’t
really need them, such as during a rest period or while doing a kick drill.
If you have trouble with your goggles fogging up (and most swimmers
do, because of the condensation formed by the difference in the air and
water temperatures), you can try several remedies. The best are the
special defogging products that deposit a thick oily film on the inside
surface of the lenses. Made especially for this purpose, these solutions
really work, swim after swim after swim. This means only a small

--- Page 372 Text ---
squeeze bottle will last virtually forever, so you can share one with a
fellow swimmer.
However, before you rush out and buy such a specialized item, you
might experiment with one or more alternatives. The handiest and
cheapest, and most popular, is good old saliva—something swimmers
have been relying on for years.
B C
ATHING APS
Remember the days of flower-petal bathing caps, or wiglike caps? Well,
today, caps are just as streamlined as suits are and come in a variety of
colors, shapes, thicknesses, and materials (e.g., latex, Lycra, and
silicone). Some pools require a cap for long-haired swimmers of either
sex, but even persons with relatively short hair will find that, although
no cap can keep your hair perfectly dry, it will keep your hair out of
your eyes and will spare it the brunt of chemical abuse. If you have long
hair, you can gather it into an elastic band before slipping on a bathing
cap. A sweatband helps to keep out water by acting as an absorptive
barrier. A Lycra cap may be worn under a rubber one; wearing it also
makes donning the rubber one easier and more comfortable. (This is
especially helpful when you’re swimming for long periods.)
After each swim, let your bathing cap air-dry. Then dust it lightly with
corn starch or talcum powder; this keeps it from sticking to itself and so
makes it easier to put on next time.
K
ICKBOARDS
If you’re going to use any “extra” piece of equipment, let it be a
kickboard. Few things can compare to this simple device—a rectangular
slab of compressed plastic—for versatility and usefulness. And that
applies for all swimmers, be they beginners, fitness seekers, or
competitors.
A kickboard can support the upper part of your body, allowing you to
breathe normally as you practice your kicks (hence the term
“kickboard”). Thus you can learn a new kick or improve a familiar one;

--- Page 373 Text ---
you can strengthen your legs for a trimmer look and stronger, faster
kicks; and you can vary your workouts.
One method of using a kickboard in the prone position is to hold it
comfortably with your arms straight along the top, fingertips curled
around the upper (rounded) edge. Or you can hold the board farther
away from you, so that you have room to put your face in the water to
practice your rhythmic breathing. Excessive prone kicking with a
kickboard may cause discomfort in your lower back. Switch to back
flutter kick for variation.
Kickboard and swim fins in use.
S F
WIM INS
Fins are more than a child’s plaything or a scuba diver’s must-have;
they’re a useful training device for the fitness and competitive swimmer
alike. In the first place, they add variety to your workouts. Second, they
help you develop muscles in your thighs, calves, and abdomen. Third,
the overload placed on these large muscle groups helps to improve your
cardiovascular capacity as well. Fourth, they help make your feet and
ankles more flexible. They also make you go faster. There are a variety
of styles, shapes, sizes, contours, and colors to fit most every need,
including a “monofin”!
According to one theory, once your body is attuned to faster action, it
continues to respond quickly, whether the fins are on or not. The added
propulsion also causes your body to ride higher in the water (to
hydroplane), which is important for most strokes, especially the butterfly;
combined with the fins’ tendency to accentuate the undulating body
motion, this means that your arms can recover higher and smoother,
resulting in a more fluid stroke. In the backstroke, fins counteract “low

--- Page 374 Text ---
legs,” a common problem in that stroke. They also give you a feel for the
efficient whipping action that your feet should develop while swimming
every stroke. (Unfortunately, fins aren’t good for practicing the
breaststroke or the sidestroke because of the nature of the kick.) Thus,
wearing fins makes your kick more effective and efficient by forcing you
to do it “the right way”; theoretically, this efficiency becomes a habit
that stays with you even when you take the fins off.
Swim fins come in several sizes, shapes, colors, weights, designs,
function and foot attachments. The shoe type are more comfortable and
stable, for some people, than the strap-backed. To put them on, bend the
heel back inside out, insert your foot, and flip the back up in place. If
you develop soreness or blisters when wearing fins, slip on a pair of thin
cotton socks to protect your feet.
Observe safety precautions when you wear fins—always walk
backwards, in the water and out. Be aware, too, that the added
propulsion can cause a pool wall to sneak up on you sooner than you’d
think: leave yourself plenty of room for your turns. The added resistance
really works out your leg muscles and your knee and ankle joints, so
start slowly, and increase your use of fins gradually. And watch out for
the phantom fin phenomenon—when you first remove the fins, you’ll
feel as though you have no feet left!
P -B
ULL UOYS
Pull-buoys are made of Styrofoam or similar material. They come in
several sizes, shapes, colors, designs, and methods of adjustment.
A pull-buoy is like a kickboard for your lower body: it supports your
legs so that you can work on your arm strokes. Thus, you can do pulling
drills to learn a new stroke, to improve technique, to build proper upper-
body strength, and to vary your workouts.
To use a pull-buoy, place it with the center or straps between your
thighs, so that when you assume a horizontal position one cylinder will
be on top of your legs and one will be under them. Press your thighs
together to hold it in place and to contribute to stability and
streamlining. It can also be used as a kickboard and as an upper-body
support during supine kicking drills.

--- Page 375 Text ---
Pull-buoys
Pull-buoy and hand paddles in use.
H P
AND ADDLES
Hand paddles fit on your palms and act the way fins do for your feet—
using them strengthens your shoulder, chest, arm, and back muscles by
increasing the water’s resistance. Hand paddles come in several shapes,
sizes, and colors, resistance designs, hand attachments, and materials
(e.g., gloves, mitts). Most are one half inch to two inches larger than
your hand all around, but there are also half-sized paddles as well as
forearm paddles.
Paddles also help you to improve your form, first by telling you
whether you’re lifting your elbow high enough during overwater
recovery: if your elbow is too low, the paddle dips into the water and the
added drag throws off your stroke noticeably. The paddles’ larger surface
area also insures that your hand enters the water at the proper angle; if
not, the slap, splash, and added resistance will be obvious. Some paddles
also have a lip at the wrist end that tells you whether you’re ending your
pull too flat or too early. Hand paddles are often used in conjunction
with a pull-buoy.
Like fins, hand paddles put an extra strain on your muscles and joints.
So use them sparingly at first and gradually increase their use during
your workouts.

THER ESISTANCE EVICES
Swimmers—especially competitive swimmers—sometimes wear
resistance devices during workouts in order to create more “drag” and so
to improve their conditioning. Such devices include small rubber
“donuts” that are twisted around the ankles in a figure 8, pull-buoys
worn between the ankles, and two or three swim suits worn one over the
other.
C O T D
LOCKS AND THER IMING EVICES
The more involved you become in swimming, the more important it will
be to have some way of timing your swims and rest periods. At the
beginning of the workout program, you can get away with
approximating the time by counting to yourself. But once you get to the
point where you’re doing timed swims, paced swims, intervals, repeats,
sprints, and timed distance swims, you need a more accurate way of
telling time.
A pace clock, which is standard equipment at many pools, is the best
instrument for this. Pace clocks have only a minute and a second hand,
and are usually large enough to be seen one pool length away.

HLORINE KIN, AND AIR
Q: Why do they put those chemicals in the pool water?
A: In the first place, to keep the water clean, safe, and swimmable.
Chlorine (slightly different from the kind found in laundry bleach) is one
of the most effective chemicals found so far to sanitize water. It helps to
kill the bacteria and algae, and may be introduced as a gas, liquid, or
powder. Chlorine also “consumes” substances that would otherwise
cloud the water: perspiration (did you realize that you sweat when you
swim?), suntan and other lotions, deodorants, and so on. So it keeps the
water clear, too.
Chemicals also serve to balance the pH level. If the water becomes
either too alkaline or too acidic, it may cause eye, ear, and skin
irritation, and it promotes the growth of bacteria. Sodium bicarbonate
(soda ash) is added to raise pH level. Muriatic acid is used to lower pH.
Q: Isn’t there some other way to keep the water clean and swimmable?
A: There are several nonchemical purification systems that
substantially reduce the need for chemicals. One uses short-wave
ultraviolet energy, which causes microorganisms literally to explode, and
thus kills algae, bacteria, viruses, and other uninvited “swimmers.”
Another is ionization, in which ion-producing electrical currents kill
bacteria and algae in the water return line; filters then remove the dead
organisms. A third technique uses chlorine/chlorozone generators to
manufacture chlorine in a form that doesn’t alter the water texture and
does away with the need for adding salts, acids, or chlorine. Finally,
there are ozone generators that sterilize water by breaking down organic
matter into carbon dioxide and water—at a rate about sixty times faster

--- Page 387 Text ---
than chemical purification! These methods are currently being tried in
hot tubs, spas, and pools; let’s hope they catch on.
Q: Does chlorine penetrate the skin?
A: No, but you should at least rinse, and preferably wash it off with
soap, after each swim.
Q: Why is it important to get rid of all the chlorine on my skin?
A: Because chlorine and salt water remove the oils that keep your
natural moisture in. Paradoxically, prolonged immersion in water of any
kind can actually dry your skin. So use a moisturizing soap when you
shower off after a swim. Then, while your skin is still slightly damp,
apply a moisturizing lotion; those containing urea or lactic acid are best.
People with dry or “delicate” skin or eczema must be extra careful,
because chlorine will worsen their condition, so it’s especially important
to apply a moisturizer if you fall into this category.
Q: Does that mean that chlorine will help people with oily skin?
A: Yes; chlorine will help clear up oily skin by removing excess oil.
People with acne will tend to see an improvement, too. And swimmers
are generally immune from “athlete’s acne,” caused when excess body
heat and sweat increase oil production and clog the pores.
Q: Sometimes my skin gets itchy between swims. Why?
A: That’s probably “swimmer’s itch,” which occurs especially in open
water. It’s an allergic reaction to a parasite (one of the schistosomes)
that superficially penetrates the skin. Repeated exposure eventually

--- Page 388 Text ---
results in an itching rash that lasts about three days. The best treatment
is calamine lotion and antihistamines.
You may also experience temporary itchiness after a really strenuous
swim. This frequently happens after hard exercise of any kind, and has
nothing to do with swimming, chlorine, or water per se. When you’re
exercising, the blood vessels dilate from the extra blood flow, and when
you stop, they constrict, sometimes causing “the blotchies.”
Q: Are swimmers especially prone to athlete’s foot or jock itch?
A: These are both fungus infections that are actually much less
common among swimmers than other athletes. Funguses prefer warmth
and moisture to grow. Since swimmers don’t generate as much heat or
perspire as much as dry-land athletes, infections of this type aren’t much
of a problem. Unless, of course, you don’t dry off your feet and groin
properly after your shower. Ears, too, can become infected with a
fungus. Apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol to the affected areas
with a cotton swab to hasten evaporation of excess water. It’s also a
good idea to sprinkle a little powder on the feet. Walking around the
locker room and shower areas with shower clogs does absolutely no
good, because funguses are all around you, all the time, just waiting for
a chance to grow. (There is a one out of three chance that you have
funguses between your toes right now.)
If you do develop either athlete’s foot or jock itch, the over-the-
counter preparations may get rid of them, but if you don’t get quick
results, see a doctor for some stronger medication to keep the fungus
from spreading.
Q: Can I still get sunburned when I’m in the water?
A: Yes; few people realize that the sun’s rays penetrate water. So if
you’re swimming outdoors, use a sunscreen or sunblock. For best results,
apply it at least one hour before going outdoors, and reapply after
you’ve come out of the water. Use an appropriate SPF. The higher the

--- Page 389 Text ---
number, the greater the protection.
Q: Are there any special steps I should take to protect my hair?
A: Water, especially if it’s chlorinated or salty, dries out hair just as it
dries out your skin. After a swim, at least rinse out your hair to remove
as much of the chlorine and other chemicals (or salt) as possible. Better
still, wash it with a mild shampoo for dry or damaged hair. Lather only
once; then apply creme rinse or conditioner to replenish the oils and to
help untangle the hair. If you find your hair feeling dry, sticky, or dull,
consider changing shampoos. Some are able to remove certain chemical
deposits that others don’t. There are specially formulated shampoos and
conditioners for those who swim in chlorinated water.
To minimize the exposure to chemicals in the first place, and to keep
hair from tangling more than it has to, wear a bathing cap—even if you
have short hair. Though none are completely leakproof, caps do offer
some protection. If you don’t wear a cap, your hair is completely
exposed to the pool chemicals, and it is whipped around in the water the
way your clothes are in a washing machine. I’ve discovered that it’s also
a good idea to wear a Lycra cap under a latex or silicone one. The Lycra
isn’t waterproof, but it’s a smooth, absorbent lining that acts as a buffer
between my hair and my outer cap, which sometimes pulls and tangles
the hair.
Q: Does my tinted (or permanented) hair require special care?
A: Chlorine enters the hair shaft, causing hair to swell and stretch
more than normal. Hair that’s already been chemically treated is more
porous and delicate than “virgin” hair, so you may be more prone to
breakage, split ends, and even discoloration. Make an extra effort to
keep your hair dry (there are Velcro bathing caps available), and treat it
very gently when wet—comb out tangles with a wide-toothed comb,
starting at the ends and working your way up toward the scalp.

--- Page 390 Text ---
Q: Should I cut my hair if I’m swimming often?
A: Short hair does make sense for swimming. And since you’ll be in
the pool, and therefore shampooing, at least three times a week, choose
a style—whether long or short or medium length—that doesn’t need
fussing to look good. Styles that you can just wash and let dry naturally
are ideal. Keep blow-drying and electric curlers to a minimum, since
they’re time-consuming, space-consuming, and damaging to the hair. To
cut down on shampooing and drying, try to schedule your swims on the
days you’d normally wash your hair anyway (or vice versa).

YES ARS OSE, AND HROAT
Q: My eyes get really bloodshot and my throat gets scratchy when I swim.
Am I allergic to the chlorine?
A: It’s very rare to be “allergic” to chlorine in the usual sense, but after
repeated exposures, many people experience an “irritant reaction” which
looks and feels like an allergic reaction with swelling, itching and
sneezing, sniffling, and red eyes.
Sometimes a scratchy throat and coughing are caused by free chlorine
particles in the air, especially in poorly ventilated indoor pools.
Q: Why do I see halos around lights after I’ve been swimming?
A: When your eyes are exposed to chemically treated and/or
hypotonic water (containing less salt than the cornea), the cornea may
swell up. This edema causes the light rays to bend as they pass through,
which results in the halos around lights that sometimes plague
swimmers. The eyes may also turn red, tear, and become overly sensitive
to light and cigarette smoke. A nap, rinsing the eyes, and time, will
alleviate this condition; goggles will prevent it.

--- Page 391 Text ---
Q: What causes the sensation of having something in my eye after I’ve been
swimming?
A: That’s another, but related, story. Exposure to chlorine can cause
superficial punctate keratitis—the outer cells of the cornea actually fall
off, leaving a nerve exposed and giving you the feeling that you have
something in your eye. It takes a day or two for this condition to heal—
that’s how long it takes your body to replace the lost cells. Again,
wearing goggles is the best way to prevent this condition.
Q: Can I get an eye infection from swimming?
A: Not if you’re swimming in a pool that’s adequately chlorinated. The
current standard of at least 2.0 parts per million of free available
chlorine is sufficient to kill all bacteria and most viruses.
Fresh-water swimming holes such as quarries and lakes, as well as
underchlorinated pools, can harbor harmful bacteria and viruses,
however. You can protect yourself from them by wearing goggles—but
not someone else’s goggles, since the infection may spread this way.
Consult a physician if you have any eye condition that persists.
Q: Can I wear my contact lenses when I swim?
A: Yes, but most recent experiments by the Centers for Disease Control
show soft contact lens wearers face certain risks. Although contact lenses
can protect your eyes from chlorine, wearing soft lenses while swimming
is associated with eye infections; in addition, you run a 4–15 percent
chance of losing the lenses. Other studies recommend you use goggles
whether or not you wear contact lenses to protect your eyes from
microorganisms and bacteria normally found in pools and natural bodies
of water. And if you do wear contacts during swimming, you should
remove them and disinfect them after twenty to thirty minutes to
minimize the risk of problems.

--- Page 392 Text ---
If you wear contacts, you might want to discuss with your optometrist
the possibility of having prescription goggles made. You can also
purchase goggles “ready made” in a variety of diopter powers.
Q: I seem to get a lot of water in my ears. Is this harmful? What’s
“swimmer’s ear”?
A: Getting water in your ears is annoying and can lead to “swimmer’s
ear.” When you swim, water sometimes travels up the Eustachian tube,
the connecting tube that stretches from behind the nose to behind the
eardrum. If you have an infection in your nasal passages, therefore, the
water can transfer the inflammation to your middle ear; this is known as
“swimmer’s ear.” This problem is pretty unusual, though, and it may
occur in scuba divers because of the changes in pressure that they’re
subjected to. And it’s more common in children than in adults, because
adults have a little kink in the Eustachian tube that tends to catch the
water. If you do develop a persistent pain in your ear, see a doctor; you
may have developed a middle-ear infection that requires professional
attention.
Q: How can I prevent water from getting in my ears? Once it’s in, how can
I get it out?
A: Wearing earplugs made of rubber, plastic, or wax may protect your
ears. The main concern with these is that, if water does get trapped
behind the plug, it could be worse than having water flowing in and out
of your outer ear. A bathing cap pulled over your ears may be sufficient
protection. Another method is to use lamb’s wool.
Wrap a small wad of lamb’s wool (sold in foot-care departments)
around your index finger; coat it with a little petroleum jelly and insert
it into the ear canal. This takes a bit of practice, so experiment a few
times until you find just the right amount and depth. I apply it every
time I swim and haven’t had “swimmer’s ear” since I have used it. It
helps to keep water out and forms just enough of a soft, absorbent

--- Page 393 Text ---
barrier to make sure that ear problems stay away.
To get water out of your ears, dry them with a hair dryer or gently use
cotton swabs. Also, there are fast-drying, antibacterial eardrops
available, made especially to prevent “swimmer’s ear.”
Q: Do swimmers get more colds than other people?
A: Swimming, of itself, doesn’t increase your chances of upper
respiratory infections. Not dressing sensibly, however, can cause
problems. In cold weather, it’s just not smart to walk outside without a
hat or scarf after swimming, since 30 to 40 percent of your body heat
escapes from your head.
Q: Sometimes I feel as though I can’t catch my breath. What’s happening?
A: It may be a result of breathing too fast too deeply. This is called
hyperventilating, or perhaps you’re not giving yourself enough rest.
Q: Can I swim with a cold?
A: Time-honored tradition takes swimmers out of the water when they
have colds. But I’ve never heard any really convincing argument as to
why people should avoid swimming when they have a mild upper
respiratory infection. It’s true that vigorous exercise does cut down your
body’s ability to fight infection, and that chlorine does irritate
respiratory passages a little. But a mild cold, the tail end of one, or a
chronic runny nose (which can happen in winter even when no infection
is present) doesn’t mean you have to stay out of the water. It depends on
how you feel.
However, it’s a different story if you have a fever, in which case you
should absolutely stay away from the pool. If you have a bad cough you
shouldn’t swim either—not only for your own sake, but to avoid
spreading disease. And don’t fool around with bad respiratory problems;

--- Page 394 Text ---
see a doctor if you’re really sick.
Q: I have a sinus condition—should I wear nose clips?
A: In case of a full-blown sinusitis, when there’s pain below the eyes,
especially when you press on the area, tremendous pressure in the sinus
cavity, and a foul taste in the mouth, you shouldn’t go in the water;
consult a physician.
However, nose clips are a matter of personal preference. Some people
are never bothered by water getting up their noses, while others seem to
get an inordinate amount of it. If you’re one of those people, it’s
reasonable to consider using nose clips. But even then they shouldn’t be
used routinely—they can be annoying and uncomfortable in themselves,
and they become one more thing that you have to concern yourself with.
In any event, there are several styles, shapes, and sizes available to fit
most noses. But nose clips should still be worn only by those who are
prone to sinus infection.
Q: Why does it burn when water gets up my nose?
A: The stinging is caused when the chlorinated water penetrates the
sinus cavities, irritating the delicate membranes that enclose them.
A P 3
CHES AND AINS
Q: What kinds of injuries do swimmers have to watch out for?
A: Very few; swimming is a relatively safe sport, perhaps the safest of
all. (In fact, sports medicine specialists often recommend swimming or
some other form of hydrotherapy to their patients who have injured
themselves during some other activity.) The water’s buoyancy makes

--- Page 395 Text ---
swimming easy on the joints and muscles, unlike dry-land sports such as
running and even bike riding. Injuries are usually a matter of overuse—
subjecting the body to something for which it is not adequately
prepared, either because the warm-up was inadequate or because the
body isn’t strong or limber enough to do as much as it’s being asked to.
In addition to simple muscle soreness, overzealous swimmers may
sometimes suffer from “swimmer’s shoulder,” which is caused by too
much freestyle, backstroke, or butterfly; knee problems, which can affect
the breaststroker; and low back pain from doing too much butterfly, or
kicking too much with a kickboard.
Q: Why do I sometimes feel stiff and sore after swimming?
A: A little bit of muscle soreness is a way of life for those of us who
exercise in order to improve our level of fitness. Theoretically, someone
who’s on a carefully designed maintenance program shouldn’t get sore.
But for most of us, slight soreness is actually desirable, because it means
you’ve been working hard enough to cause a change in your body,
which, eventually, means an improved physical condition. Although it’s
really difficult to cause a sprain or strain while swimming, you should
always listen to your body. If it hurts while you’re swimming, don’t push
yourself. Simple muscle soreness is caused when waste products such as
lactic acid build up in the muscles, and is usually evident the next day.
Q: What can I do to prevent or ease achy muscles?
A: To reduce simple muscle soreness, begin your exercise program
slowly and progress gradually. Try not to be that weekend athlete who
exercises furiously on Saturday and Sunday, then limps to work on
Monday. Exercise regularly so that your muscles stay in shape. For best
results, swim every other day so your body has a chance to recover.
Remember to warm up and cool down to ease your muscles from a state
of rest to one of activity, then back to relative inactivity. There is no
medical treatment for muscle soreness; liniments containing oil of

--- Page 396 Text ---
wintergreen may ease the pain but do not promote healing. Relaxed,
easy swimming is the ideal therapy for mild soreness. If the pain is
severe, apply ice for the first day, then switch to heat. If discomfort
persists, see a doctor; the problem may be a real injury that requires
professional help.
Q: Will taking a sauna or steambath help soreness?
A: These dilate the blood vessels so that more blood flows to the
muscles, which helps to carry away the excess lactic acid. Whirlpools,
saunas, and steambaths therefore can be helpful. But they’re not the real
answer—stretching and a proper warm-up and cool-down are. (Saunas,
etc., are not recommended instead of a warm-up just before you go into
the water because of the extreme change in temperature.)
Q: Will a massage help my aching muscles?
A: Yes. A good massage will not only ease already sore muscles but
will help prevent soreness from occurring. Massage can release muscle
tension and help to remove the accumulated toxins that cause muscle
fatigue. Massage also improves your circulation in general and so helps
to calm your nerves, aid digestion, and leave you with a feeling of well-
being.
Q: What about pains in my joints?
A: These are very few and far between among swimmers, and usually
occur only when you are swimming great distances, as competitive
swimmers do. But they can affect any one of us when overenthusiasm
induces us to do “too much too soon.” Even those who know better
occasionally overdo it, as one intermediate swimmer can testify: “There I
was, on my first winter vacation since I’d taken up swimming for fitness.
I had access to a beautiful 50-meter outdoor pool, and, boy, did I take

--- Page 397 Text ---
advantage of that. I saw it as a golden opportunity to increase my
distance—and I did: from 500 meters to 2,500 meters in four days! I was
in pretty good shape generally, from calisthenics, dancing, and jogging,
so my muscles didn’t hurt much; they just felt nice and tight. But after
my fourth day, my left shoulder began to hurt. I figured it was just a sore
deltoid—I’d switched breathing sides and my left arm was getting more
than its accustomed workout. But the next day, I heard a clicking sound
when I did the freestyle and figured something more serious was up.”
She was right. She had the beginnings of tendinitis—an inflammation
of the connective tissue. The constant repetition of the arm motions was
just too much for her shoulder to bear at this point in her development.
Q: How do I prevent or treat tendinitis?
A: To prevent tendinitis, increase your workload gradually by
following my step-by-step programs. Not only will that keep you from
overdoing it, it will make sure that your technique is correct—another
possible cause of injury and discomfort. And always warm up thoroughly
before every workout, and cool down properly afterward. Between
workouts, do some resistance exercises to build up muscle strength. If
you’re a “weekend athlete,” don’t overestimate your ability; you may
regret it on Monday morning.
If you do develop joint problems, avoid the motion that caused it until
the problem clears up (usually less than a week): Avoid resistive devices
or kickboard use if your knees or shoulders are sore. Try other strokes
such as sculling, the breaststroke, maybe the backstroke, or treading. If
your knees or ankles are sore, do more arm-stroke drills.
Once the tendinitis is under control, you should modify your stroke
(i.e., don’t swing your arms quite so high, or do a modified whip kick) to
prevent a recurrence. If possible, have your stroke techniques critiqued
to identify movements that may be causing the condition.
Try alternate breathing during the crawl, too; the arm opposite your
breathing side sometimes pulls deeper and harder than the other, so
tendinitis usually occurs, if at all, there. Alternate breathing not only
helps to balance your stroke, it creates an even load on both arms.

--- Page 398 Text ---
Unless the pain is severe, usually a little sensible attention, some heat,
and perhaps an anti-inflammatory drug such as aspirin are the best
treatment—try them before you consult an orthopedist.
Q: Why is water so good for therapy?
A: For many reasons:
It reduces the effects of gravity, so that there’s less strain on the
joints. The water’s buoyancy supports and cushions the entire
body.
At the same time, the water’s resistance helps build muscle
strength and tone—but gently, because the same resistance
precludes fast, jerky movements that could lead to injury.
The water also relaxes muscles, especially if it’s 80 degrees F. or
above. (Muscles aren’t tense while they’re working.) This also
extends your range of motion, thereby helping to keep your
body limber.
Water stimulates the circulation, increasing the flow of oxygen
and energy to the muscles.
So it’s no wonder that therapists prescribe gentle swimming and
special hydrotherapy exercises for patients who have been injured or
who suffer from chronic joint problems (such as post-fracture patients
and victims of arthritis).
Q: Can water exercise help my back problem?
A: Yes, except in the case of severe neck injuries. In particular, the
elementary backstroke is easy on your back.
Q: Can water exercise help my shoulder and knee pain?

--- Page 399 Text ---
A: Do gentle water exercises that will increase the range of motion of
these joints; progressive exercise to build up the surrounding muscles
gradually will help take the strain off the joints. A gentle breaststroke
(for shoulder problems) and crawl stroke (for knee problems) will help
loosen up the affected areas.
Q: The common cramp—what is it, what causes it, how do I deal with it?
A: A cramp, an abrupt, powerful contraction of the muscle fibers, may
be caused by fatigue, overexertion, cold, or lack of warm-up. Most
commonly, it occurs in the leg, particularly in the calf muscle.
Treatment of the cramp is aimed at releasing the contraction. This is
often best accomplished by alternately flexing and extending the affected
area, and by kneading with the thumbs.
E W 4
SPECIALLY FOR OMEN
Q: Can I swim while I’m menstruating?
A: It’s up to you. But thanks to the tampon, you can swim at any time
of the month.
Most of the available research indicates that menstruation itself is no
reason to stop swimming (or any other exercise). During your period,
mild exercise is usually at least as effective (and healthier overall) as
crawling into bed with a hot water bottle and a snifter of brandy.
Some women do say that their performance is affected while they’re
menstruating. In several surveys, about half of the women said they
didn’t notice any difference; of the rest, about half said they performed
worse—but the other half said they performed better! Some of this may
be psychological, some may be due to very real fluctuations in the blood
pressure and resting pulse rate. And if you take medication for your
discomfort, that may affect your performance, too.

--- Page 400 Text ---
Q: Will exercise affect my periods?
A: Yes—for the better. In general, women who exercise regularly
suffer fewer of the discomforts associated with menstruation: fewer
headaches, less tension, and fewer and less severe cramps and lower
back pains. And studies have shown that exercising five days prior to the
onset of your period can even curb premenstrual tension and depression
by letting you sweat away extra water and sodium. And since swimming
is a natural diuretic, it helps to combat the common problem of water
retention, which in turn helps banish “bloat” and the myriad of
discomforts it’s responsible for.
Occasionally, competitive athletes experience dysmenorrhea (painful
periods) or amenorrhea (cessation of periods). No one is quite sure why
this happens, but it may be that their lowered percentage of body fat
affects the production of hormones. In any event, this effect does not last
once the training regimen is lightened. And lest you think that this is the
perfect form of birth control—this phenomenon is evident only among
the highest level of competitive athletes.
Q: Can I swim if I’m pregnant?
A: Unless there are special circumstances, there’s absolutely nothing
wrong with swimming while you’re pregnant. As a matter of fact,
exercise assists the circulation, which helps the growth of the fetus, and
it tones the muscles, which helps the mother during labor and delivery.
During the middle and later stages of a pregnancy, dry-land exercises
may prove uncomfortable and even dangerous. Even if you’re been
exercising all along, you might fall and/or jar the internal organs. But
water’s buoyancy, along with its natural cushioning properties
(remember, nature chose water to surround and protect the developing
baby), makes swimming the safest and most comfortable exercise for
those who are exercising “for two.” In fact, you may feel even better in
the water than on land because of water’s gravity-defying properties. All
these reasons are why obstetricians often recommend that you swim
your way through pregnancy.

--- Page 401 Text ---
Many pregnant women who were fitness swimmers have swum
through their pregnancies. They have mentioned that, even though they
might feel tired when they begin, they finish their swim with a sense of
well-being and relaxation. However, they’ve pointed out that they
usually depend more on their arm strength than on their legs, so as not
to put any unnecessary strain on the uterus. Swimming also helped them
to keep their weight in check and eased their deliveries.
Q: But surely I shouldn’t be doing fifty yards of the butterfly in my eighth
month?
A: True, the nature of your workouts will change as your body does;
when you’re pregnant, you should never swim so hard or so long that
you feel uncomfortable. (Be sure to check with your obstetrician before
beginning any exercise program.) In general, you should gradually begin
to swim more slowly as your pregnancy progresses. Do fewer and/or
longer intervals if your workouts usually include them. Concentrate on
long, slow, easy swims. Your stroke mechanics will change slightly
because you’ll become more buoyant, but chances are that your crawl,
backstroke, and breaststroke will remain relatively intact. The butterfly,
flip turns, and dives, on the other hand, may have to be eliminated. Do
more and more water exercises during a workout, too. Swim as late into
the pregnancy as your doctor will allow, and resume swimming
afterward to regain your figure.
Q: Can I swim if I have a vaginal or bladder infection?
A: Mild cases of vaginitis or cystitis are no reason to stop swimming.
The water won’t enter the urethra; and the small amount that may enter
the vagina is negligible. However, if your condition is serious enough to
warrant medical attention, follow your doctor’s advice. In the case of a
yeast infection, which is affected by excess moisture, your physician will
probably recommend that you stay out of the pool.

--- Page 402 Text ---
Q: How can I prevent yeast infections?
A: Wear a dry suit whenever possible (e.g., in between events at swim
meets). When changing, be certain to dry yourself thoroughly with a
fresh towel, paper towels, or a blow dryer. Also, your diet plays an
important part in preventing these infections.

UTRITION IET EIGHT OSS
Q: Do I have to follow a special diet to be on a fitness program?
A: Not really, except that it is extra important that you get the right
amounts of all the nutrients your body needs. It’s a myth that athletes
need more protein than sedentary people; the average 150-pound
person, whatever his or her level of activity, needs about 50 grams a
day, and some authorities maintain that even that’s an overestimate.
Although muscles are composed of protein, extra protein alone doesn’t
increase your muscle mass.
Q: So what’s a balanced diet?
A: That’s still a pretty controversial subject as far as vitamins and
minerals go. However, it is clear that, in terms of protein, carbohydrates,
and fats, a balanced diet is definitely not the typical American fare,
which is far too high in refined carbohydrates, fat, and salt, and often
unnecessarily high in protein. According to the United States Senate
Nutrition Committee’s report, “Dietary Goals for the United States,” the
typical American should adopt a diet that, compared to his present one,
is:
lower in calories
lower in salt
lower in refined carbohydrates (ideally, approximately 15

percent of total calories)
lower in fats of all kinds (no more than 30 percent of all
calories and some authorities recommend even less fat)
higher in complex carbohydrates such as fresh fruits and
vegetables and whole grains (ideally 55–60 percent of total
calories)
It’s best to eat a wide variety of wholesome foods, including plenty of
fresh fruits and vegetables; lots of whole grains and beans; and some
low-fat dairy and meat products such as skim milk, fish, poultry, and
beef (if you eat meat). The more active you become, the more calories
you’ll need to maintain your weight and supply your body with nutrients
and energy. There’s a bonus to this kind of eating pattern, too; studies
suggest that low-fat, high-fiber diets help keep you healthier by reducing
the risk of many diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer.
Q: Do active people need more vitamins and minerals than other people?
Should I take supplements?
A: The evidence is not completely clear on this controversial subject;
however, some studies indicate physical exertion does require higher
levels of certain nutrients, and that certain nutrients can improve your
physical performance. In addition, many published reports show that,
even in affluent and presumably well-fed societies such as ours, some
people are highly deficient in certain nutrients. For example, one of the
most common deficiencies in Americans is that of iron—particularly in
women of childbearing age. The fact that a woman loses two to four
ounces of blood every month means that many women don’t have
enough iron in their systems to produce hemoglobin, which is what
carries oxygen to the body’s muscles. Since women store less iron in
their bodies than men do, and have a lower hemoglobin count to begin
with, they may have a problem with utilizing oxygen properly. Because
a muscle needs adequate oxygen to perform, an active woman may need
to supplement her iron intake.
A lack of potassium has been indicated as a cause of muscle cramps—

--- Page 404 Text ---
something that an avid exerciser should watch out for. Since strenuous
exercise causes you to excrete potassium to help your body dissipate the
additional heat generated, it’s wise to replace this mineral by eating
fruits and vegetables. Magnesium is another mineral the level of which
plummets during heavy exercise; good sources are dark bread, nuts, and
vegetables. So, as insurance, many athletes and active people take
vitamin and mineral supplements. But remember, these are supplements
to—not substitutes for—healthful foods.
Q: What’s a good reducing diet?
A: Swimming (or any other strenuous, regular exercise) will help cure
“spoon-in-mouth disease,” even if you maintain your present caloric
intake. If you swam enough to burn up about 500 calories every day,
you’d lose one pound per week. However, since most fitness swimmers
don’t swim that long or that hard, they also need to modify their diet in
order to lose weight at a reasonable rate.
Diet plans come and go, but crash diets and fad diets simply won’t
work over the long haul. You can’t stay on them forever because they
are either too boring, too extreme, or too impractical. Diet plans that
help you take off weight and keep it off are ones that are designed to
change your eating habits for a lifetime. They’ll also reduce the risk of
vitamin and mineral deficiencies. According to nutritionist Shari
Lieberman in The Real Vitamin and Mineral Book (Avery Publishing
Group, Inc., 1990), researchers found that none of the eleven best-selling
diet books supplied a full 100 percent of the Recommended Dietary
Allowances (RDAs) for thirteen vitamins and minerals.
There are many appropriate and healthful weight-reducing options
now available. Since weight-reducing requirements, goals, and
motivation vary among individuals, you might find it helpful to get an
overview of the various weight-loss programs. Two books that might aid
you are Diets That Work by D. Scanlon, R.D. (Contemporary Books,
1992), and Straight Talk About Weight Control (Consumers Union, Mount
Vernon, New York, 1991).
But whatever your diet, be sure that it’s properly balanced. If you cut

--- Page 405 Text ---
down too much on protein, for example, your body actually begins to
consume the protein of which your muscles are made. And active people
actually need plenty of complex carbohydrates, for energy and for the B
vitamins that your body needs to convert food into energy. Fats and junk
foods you can do away with—your body requires only one to two ounces
of fat per day, and you’ll probably get at least that much from other
foods.
Q: How can swimming help me to lose (or keep from gaining) weight?
A: In many ways. That’s why I say to people: “You like to eat? You’d
better swim!” I love to eat. Most babies’ first words are something like
“Mama” or “Dada”; mine was “cheesecake!”
If you think lying around all day drinking diet sodas and nibbling on
plain lettuce sprinkled with lemon juice will do the trick … think again.
Exercise is the magic ingredient in the recipe for successful dieting.
It’s physically impossible to eat while swimming (I know—I’ve
tried!). So nip a potential binge in the bud: slip on a swim suit
and get thee to a pool.
Strenuous exercise actually helps to curb your appetite.
Experiments have shown that, although moderate exercise may
increase your desire for food, vigorous activities such as
running, jumping rope, or swimming (which also burn the most
calories) have just the opposite effect. In other words, the last
thing you’ll feel like doing after a two-mile swim is stuffing
yourself.
Exercise raises your metabolism (the rate at which you burn
calories), not only during the activity itself, but for long
afterward. So hours after you’re out of the pool, you’re still
reaping the rewards.
It seems a paradox, but exercise actually gives you more
energy, so you may not feel as tempted to gobble a candy bar as
a “pick-me-up.” By the same token, once you’ve reached a
certain level of fitness, you’ll notice that empty-calorie junk

--- Page 406 Text ---
foods clog up your finely tuned system.
Exercise relaxes you, and so cuts down on the compulsive
eating that results from nervous tension. Next time you “need”
a slice of pie, take a brisk swim instead.
So do what I do—leave those pounds in the pool.
Q: How many calories will I burn if I exercise in the water?
A: Although the oxygen consumption level of the muscles most
accurately determines the calorie burn, your heart rate is more easily
used as a reference for your workout intensity. Recent research has been
done with water exercise which indicates that the number of calories
burned during water walking increases with the depth of the water.
Walking 3 miles per hour can burn up to 500 calories in thigh-high
water. A half hour of deep-water running burns about 300 calories,
compared with about 200 to 250 for running, 150 for playing tennis,
and 150 to 200 for aerobics. For a 150-pound person, swimming at his
target heart rate (THR) burns approximately 10-15 calories a minute;
this is approximately 600 calories per hour.
There is some evidence that swimming is not as effective as dry-land
exercise for losing body fat, if you’re already fat. This may be because
swimming is basically an arm exercise; you need to use big muscles in
the legs and buttocks to burn fat. And if you are doing water aerobics,
the body weighs much less in water than on land, so the leg muscles
don’t have to work as hard as on dry land. In addition, exercising in
water also helps keep muscles cool. The more the muscles heat up, the
harder the heart beats to pump blood through the body to carry the heat
away; if the water already is doing this job, the heart rate doesn’t need
to rise as much.
The bottom line is: are Olympic swimmers fat? No! Not in my book!

WIMMING ASTER AND ARTHER

Q: What are the key elements of my workout?
A: To get the most out of your workout, whether you swim for fitness
or competition, you should focus on the following:
Safety Considerations
Including how you feel throughout your workout.
Environmental Considerations
An awareness of other swimmers, as well as potential dangers
including equipment usage.
Pacing Your Workout
Recognizing your energy output and speed as you progress
through your workout.
Stroke Technique
Awareness of your body position, your arm and leg motions
when swimming, as well as when practicing drills.
Keeping Track of Your Workout
With respect to number of repetitions and/or laps.
And above all—remember to breathe rhythmically and
continuously.
And enjoy your workout!
Q: What should I do when I feel discouraged about my swimming progress?
A: You need a pep talk—what coaches usually hand out to raise their
teams’ spirits and to help them over the rough spots. Everyone—fitness
and competitive swimmer alike—needs a little boost now and then.
Remember that your swimming is a long-range project. It requires
dedication and self-discipline; depending on how far you want to go
with it, you may find it taking up considerable chunks of your time and
energy. Stick with it during the plateaus, when you seemingly are
making little progress. Remember, good swimmers aren’t born; they’re
made. Hang in there!
Q: Why do men generally outperform women in sports?

--- Page 408 Text ---
A: In head-to-head competition, the best man in a particular sport will
virtually always beat the best woman. Generally, men are stronger than
women are. They have larger bones and muscles; their hearts and lungs
are 10 percent larger, and they have higher levels of oxygen-bearing
hemoglobin. This seems to be brought about by the male hormone
testosterone since, until puberty, male and female capacities don’t differ
that much. But strength isn’t the final word in athletic endeavors—skill
and endurance account for a lot—especially in swimming.
Consider this: the differences between men’s and women’s times in all
sports are rapidly shrinking. Women today are breaking records set by
men during the 1960s, and many male Olympic champs of only a few
games ago wouldn’t even qualify for women’s Olympic teams these days.
The difference in swimming (and track) times is diminishing so fast that
one scientist, K. F. Dyer, an Australian, has gone so far as to say that
they will vanish completely, at least in the long-distance events, quite
soon. The theoretical explanation of why women give men a run for
their money in longer-distance swimming is twofold. For one thing,
women are more buoyant than men; for another, women’s bodies have
more energy reserves (in the form of fat), which they are able to tap
more efficiently. And although women’s narrower shoulders sacrifice
some upper body strength, they make up for it by allowing a more
resistance-free passage through the water.
Some older people recognize that women weren’t given the chance to
train and compete the way men were. Title IX of the Education
Amendments, passed in 1972, which provides that “no person in the
United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from
participation … in any education program or activity receiving Federal
financial assistance,” began to turn things around. But as anyone
familiar with either the civil rights movement or the women’s movement
must be aware, it’s a long hard battle toward equal opportunity.
Q: Why are some people better at sprinting and others at swimming long
distances?
A: Partly because of training, and partly because of heredity. Every

--- Page 409 Text ---
muscle is made up of two types of fibers. Red fibers, also known as slow-
twitch fibers, give you endurance. White, or fast-twitch, fibers are for
speed and strength. Everyone has a different ratio of red to white fibers,
which is fixed at birth. You can, however, develop whatever you have.
That’s why it’s best for persons with a higher percentage of red fibers to
swim long distances; and for persons with more white fibers to train for
short distances. (Unfortunately, the only way you can tell to which
group you belong, short of a muscle biopsy, is trial and error.)
Q: How can I develop my white fibers so that I swim faster?
A: First of all, you should swim against the clock. Interval training
makes you aware of how long it takes you to swim a specific distance. (It
also gives you an incentive to swim faster, since the quicker you go the
more rest you get.) Once you’ve developed this internal clock, you have
to train harder and/or develop a more efficient technique in order to
reduce your times. Ultimately, your body will figure out its own little
tricks (in addition to the tips in this book) to speed you through the
water. You will reach a point where your mind and body will work
together to find the best way for you to swim.
A coach or a more advanced swimmer can accelerate this process by
conveying to the developing swimmer those little nuances that improve
performance. This is truer of swimming than of many other sports in
which, if you don’t “have it” naturally, there’s very little that you can do
about it. In swimming, there’s plenty of room for those who aren’t
“naturals” to apply techniques as effectively as those who are considered
natural talents. As with anything else, it takes time to learn these
subtleties, and many swimmers go through a long period of trial and
error. Hopefully, this book will reduce that time as much as possible.
Q: What causes the muscles to feel tight after a hard swim?
A: This tight feeling is caused by lactic acid, a by-product of the
chemical reaction that occurs in the muscles. The muscle cells are

--- Page 410 Text ---
converting food fuel into energy, using oxygen. Lactic acid builds up
when the cells don’t get enough oxygen. As you swim regularly over
time, your body learns to use oxygen more efficiently. So, the better
condition you’re in and the longer it takes you to go into oxygen debt,
the longer you can function in that state and the faster you’ll recover
from it. Also, learning how to pace yourself evenly can help reduce the
buildup of lactic acid in the beginning of your swim.
Q: Why do my legs get tight and tired quickly when I’m swimming fast?
A: During a workout, a timed swim, or a race, many swimmers have a
tendency to overkick. When this happens, the large muscles in your legs,
particularly the quadriceps along the front of the thigh, use up
tremendous amounts of oxygen even though they push more water up
and down than backward, they don’t add that much to your forward
propulsion. As a result, you tire quickly. Since kicking also works your
abdominal and chest muscles, and your diaphragm, overkicking may
also throw off your rhythmic breathing pattern. To avoid oxygen debt
during sprints or fast swims, try to establish a kicking pattern that’s
proportionate to the rest of the stroke. Once you’ve worn yourself out by
overkicking, it’s difficult to resume comfortable breathing and get a
second wind, because you have to “repay” your oxygen debt. (See this
page for the relative power of the pull and the kick in the various
strokes.)
Q: My arms, shoulders, and the muscles along my upper body get sore after
a long swim. What should I do?
A: Distance swimmers especially rely on their upper bodies to supply
most of the forward propulsion. So during a long swim, such as 1,500
meters (metric mile), or a 2-mile “marathon,” the muscles you mention
get a tremendous workout. The best way to prevent them from
tightening up, especially after a race, is to take a slow, easy cool-down
swim (or “swim down”). Then stretch the upper body for a few minutes

--- Page 411 Text ---
(see “Swimmers’ Shape-ups,” this page); repeat the stretch several times
during the first half hour afterward, if possible.
Q: Where and when did the competitive swimming begin?
A: Although swimming wasn’t part of the ancient Olympics, it was
enjoyed by the Greeks and other early civilizations. Young men swam in
ancient Greece and Rome as part of their military training. The first
recorded swimming competitions were held in Japan in 36
B.C.
Modern competitive swimming began in the mid-nineteenth century.
Shortly thereafter, what later came to be known as the Amateur
Swimming Association was formed and established rules for competition.
In 1908, FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation Amateur), the
world governing body for swimming and other aquatic competition, was
founded. When the first modern Olympiad was held in Greece in 1896,
there were three men’s freestyle events, which were swum in the ocean.
It wasn’t until the games held in Stockholm in 1912 that swimming
events for women were included. Now, swimming is a major part of the
summer games.
Q: Does shaving down (shaving the arms, legs, and chest) before a race
actually increase a swimmer’s speed?
A: This can help—psychologically as well as physically. Shaving,
which you usually save for your biggest meet of the season, can be an
important part of the psych-up that you do for the big event. It makes
your body feel lighter, more slippery; you feel as though you’re getting
more out of your kick, riding higher in the water, and slicing through it
cleanly and smoothly.
Q: What and when should I eat before a competition?
A: It’s best to eat a relatively light, easily digestible meal about three

--- Page 412 Text ---
to four hours before the event. Some favorites are tuna sandwiches, lean
meat or poultry, milk, or fruit. Foods high in fat should be avoided
because they take a long time to digest and may therefore cause
discomfort. Highly refined carbohydrates, such as candy bars, should be
avoided, since they stimulate the production of insulin, which eventually
lowers your blood sugar and results in a let-you-down instead of a pick-
me-up.
Q: What’s carbohydrate loading?
A: Muscles get their energy from glycose, which the body
manufactures from carbohydrates. However, since the body has a limited
capacity to store this sugar, athletes often load up on carbohydrates—
especially pasta, potatoes, and bread—before an event in order to make
sure that their glycogen stores are filled to capacity. However, for
swimming a workout or even a meet (unless it’s a marathon swim),
carbohydrate loading is not really needed, since, in this case, the
demand on your glycose reserves is not that severe.
Q: What is Masters swimming?
A: Masters swimming is a nationwide competitive swimming program.
It began when Dr. Ransom Arthur, of the Navy Medical Neuropsychiatric
Research Unit in San Diego, became inspired by the Amateur Athletic
Union’s Masters track and field program and joined forces with John
Spannuth, then president of the American Swimming Coaches
Association. The Navy supported the idea of establishing a regular
swimming program for adults, and the first Masters swim meet was held
in May 1970. From that humble beginning (there were only fifty
participants), the program grew: as of this writing, there are
approximately thirty thousand Masters swimmers, and their ranks are
ever expanding, due in part to the continuing interest and sponsorship
for promoting adult fitness Masters activities by the U. S. Masters
Swimming, Inc.

--- Page 413 Text ---
Q: What are the goals of the Masters Swimming Program? What benefits
will I derive if I join?
A: The program’s primary purpose is to promote physical fitness via
training and competitive swimming. The competition is relatively low-
key and is held in five-year age groups (from twenty-five to twenty-nine,
to ninety and over) so that you’re competing against swimmers who are
approximately the same age you are. By setting goals toward which
older participants can work, the program provides motivation for
continuing a training regimen despite inconveniences and time
pressures. Competition is a useful way of measuring your progress, and
it’s exciting. A fringe benefit is to foster fellowship and camaraderie
among the participants. If there are no Masters clubs near you, help to
start one. (I did.)
Q: Where can I find more information about Masters swimming?
A: Ask for information from either your local Masters swimming club
or contact U.S. Masters Swimming, Inc.

Q: What are the Senior Olympics?
A: In addition to Masters swimming, there are also competitions
locally, regionally, nationally, and internationally that encompass senior
age groups, including the United States Senior Sports Classic. There are
competitions for men and women aged fifty-five and over in a variety of
individual and team sports including swimming. For further information,

Q: What about swim camps?
A: Aside from attending regular organized workouts, you can go to
camp. There are many swim camps around the country, open to
swimmers of all ages and abilities, where you can spend five to seven
hours a day in the water, learning from coaches, trainers, and other
swimmers. Activities include videotapes of your technique, with various
films and lectures, to learn about conditioning, stretching, dry-land
exercises, and nutrition for swimmers. Length of camp, cost, and
amenities will vary. Novice fitness swimmers and Masters swimmers can
benefit greatly from attending a swim camp.
To find swim camps, browse through the swim magazines listed on
this page. Check them also for the local swim clinics that are held near
you throughout the country.

DD AND NDS
Q: I’m a runner who is considering beginning a swimming program; how
does swimming compare with running?
A: Both are excellent aerobic exercises. If you compared a champion
runner with a champion swimmer, the runner would go one mile in
about four minutes; the swimmer would cover a mile in about four times
as long, or sixteen minutes. The training effect follows the same ratio:
the benefits of swimming a half mile are comparable to those of running
two miles. (Of course, skill is a mitigating factor—if you’re a good
runner but an inefficient swimmer, for instance, swimming a half mile
may be harder for you than running even four miles.)
If you’ve been running for fitness and switch over to swimming, you’ll

--- Page 415 Text ---
notice that there are fewer injuries and pains—no shin splints, no foot
problems such as blisters, and a far lower incidence of joint problems—
because there’s no pounding the pavement. When you swim, there’s less
danger of overheating while you exercise, too, since the water acts as a
natural coolant for your body.
Since swimming uses the arms and upper body more than the legs,
you may want to balance your program with some dry-land exercises. I
think jogging, walking briskly, jumping rope, bicycle riding, skating,
skiing, and dancing are all good adjuncts to your swimming regimen.
You may want to do them especially on the days when you don’t swim.
Q: How can I swim if the pool is crowded?
A: The first thing to do is to try to swim in a counterclockwise
direction within your lane, staying to the right side much as if you were
driving along a two-way road. Try to find a lane with swimmers that go
about the same speed as you. (Some pools label their lanes according to
speed.) If this isn’t possible, you can pass on the left if you’re faster
(assuming that no one is coming in the opposite direction); or let others
pass you if you’re slower. Another possibility is to swim one fast lap,
then get out and walk back to your starting side and do another lap.
(These are “windsprints.”) If worse comes to worst, do some stationary
kicking, bobbing, treading, or other water exercises until the traffic
clears up. Swimming isn’t supposed to be a contact sport; nor should you
have to wait around for your own lane—depending on the length of the
pool, up to twelve swimmers can use one lane if they observe principles
of pool courtesy.
Q: I’m discouraged that I can’t seem to make much progress in my
swimming. What can I do?
A: At any stage of the game, swimmers can reach a plateau. Usually
the support and advice of another swimmer is the key:

--- Page 416 Text ---
Swim with a buddy if you haven’t been already. Having another
person there can make all the difference in the world.
Join a swim class to obtain some general pointers.
Take private lessons from an instructor who makes you feel at
ease.
Q: What’s the difference between a “lap” and a “length” in a pool?
A: In the United States, at least, they’re usually the same thing.
Although a few people prefer to count a lap as one round trip, the term
generally means one length of the pool.
Q: Why do I have the urge to urinate while I’m swimming?
A: Although there’s no physiological explanation for this widely
observed phenomenon, various medical experts have speculated that it
may be caused in part by the difference between the air and water
temperatures and by the increased activity.
Q: Why do I get so thirsty during and after a swim?
A: Even though you may not realize it, you perspire when you swim.
You also exhale water vapor, and you produce more urine, as discussed
above. Finally, the alum added to the pool water tends to make your
mouth feel dry.
Q: Should I learn all those different strokes?
A: Although it’s no crime to do the doggie paddle, the strokes
described in this book are much more efficient—and therefore, once you
get the hang of them, actually easier. Learning and improving the
different strokes also makes swimming more fun, more interesting, more

--- Page 417 Text ---
challenging, and a better all-round exercise.
Q: How can I keep track of my laps when I’m swimming a long distance?
A: It’s easy to lose count, but the more you swim, the easier it
becomes. Here are a few tricks to help you remember. The first is to
divide the swim, mentally, into smaller ones. Let’s say you’re swimming
1,650 yards or 1,500 meters (almost one mile) straight. In a 25-yard
pool, you can divide the swim into four 400-yard swims (and subdivide
that if needed), plus two laps. For shorter swims, you can divide the
distance into 100s; just count “1” for every 100 yards. To help you mark
the end of each segment, do a different turn: alternate closed and flip
turns after every 100 yards, for instance.
You can also keep track by varying your breathing pattern. Breathe
rhythmically (on the same side) during every odd-numbered 100;
breathe alternately (every three arm strokes for the crawl) during the
even 100s. You could base a whole workout on a pyramid-type breathing
pattern: breathe every other stroke, then every third stroke, every fourth
stroke, every fifth stroke, and back down again.
An alternate approach is to swim “by the clock.” If you know that you
cover 50 yards (two laps in a 25-yard pool) in one minute, for example,
swimming for a straight 10 minutes means that you will cover
approximately 500 yards, or twenty laps.
An amusing alternative is to sing to yourself, as Diana Nyad does
during her marathon open-water swims. (Her version of “Row, Row,
Row Your Boat” takes seventy-five choruses to make a mile; another of
her favorites is “Frère Jacques” in three languages.) Anyone know the
words to “Ebb Tide”?
Q: What is a “swimmer’s high”?
A: This is a state, comparable to “jogger’s high,” in which you get the
feeling of simultaneous exhilaration and calmness. It usually occurs once
you’ve gotten into the main set of your workout. Your mind has drifted

--- Page 418 Text ---
away from your daily concerns; your breathing is not labored; your
muscles are loose. It’s a mental as well as a physical high that leaves you
feeling better, with more energy and direction than you had before. (Or
maybe you’re just hooked on chlorine!)
Q: Sometimes I forget the combination to my lock; any tips on how to
remember it?
A: You can write the combination on the inside of your goggles strap
or bathing cap, or on your bathing suit tag. You might want to use
indelible ink, but I find that most ballpoint pen inks last and last.
Q: Why is it best to swim three times a week?
A: According to recent studies, your body needs aerobic exercise
approximately every sixty hours in order to maintain a level of fitness.
That’s about every two and a half days, which works out to
approximately every other day, or three times a week.
Q: Is it possible to swim too much?
A: Yes. If you feel overtired, run down, achy or listless, or that you’re
working hard without seeing any improvement, you may be swimming
too much. Even in your training, you can go overboard and become
“stale,” especially if you don’t peak and taper for a meet (see this page).
Fitness and competitive swimmers alike should remember that there’s
more to life than swimming; no matter how dedicated you are, leave
some time and energy for other interests.
Q: My spouse (child, friend) swims so much that I never see him or her
anymore. What should I do?

--- Page 419 Text ---
A: Perhaps you should consider getting in the swim, too. Not only is it
more enjoyable if both of you swim, but you’ll both be healthier, and
you’ll have an interest to share. And if you become a swimming family,
chances are that you’ll become more active, change your eating habits
for the better, and meet new friends.
Q: Why do some people call swimming the “Fountain of Youth”?
A: Dr. Paul Hutinger, a Masters swim champion in his mid-sixties and
a research specialist in the physiology of exercise at Western Illinois
University, has called swimming the “Fountain of Youth.” You can slow
down and even help reverse the aging process if you follow a regular,
year-round fitness program. But this exercise must continue throughout
life if it is to have an extended effect. Swimming is the ideal sport to
enjoy your whole life long, because it causes very little wear and tear on
your joints. Aging is also affected by heredity and pathology, and the
benefits of a fitness program depend to a certain degree on your age at
its inception. So, although swimming may not be the “Fountain of
Youth” for everyone, it may at least prove to be the “Fountain of Middle
Age.” And if that doesn’t impress you twenty-year-olds—wait till you’re
seventy!
Q: Where can I swim when abroad?
A: Purchase a copy of the F.I.N.A. handbook. It will tell you how to
contact the people who can advise you about suitable pools in various
countries. Also contact U. S. Masters Swimming and Masters Swimming
International.
Q: Sometimes my muscles begin to feel a little tight when I swim. What
should I do?
A: Do these in-between loosening-up exercises.

--- Page 420 Text ---
Bob in place for a minute or two.
Swim a few very slow laps, exaggerating your stroke roll and
recovery of arms.
Shrug your shoulders, rotate your head and arms, stretch your
legs and back, and do water exercises. Then resume swimming.
Q: Will smoking affect my swimming ability?
A: Definitely. Cigarette smoking speeds up your heartbeat, increases
your blood pressure, and lowers the supply of oxygen in your blood.
Over a period of time, smoking causes inflammation of the bronchial
tubes, an increase in the secretion of mucus, changes in the epithelial
cells, and a destruction of the lungs’ elasticity.
Of the hundreds of chemical substances in cigarette smoke, nicotine,
“tar,” and carbon monoxide are the most dangerous. Nicotine constricts
your blood vessels, cutting down the flow of blood and oxygen and
making your heart pump harder. “Tar,” which contains chemicals that
have caused cancer in laboratory animals, forms a brown sticky coating
over your lungs. Carbon monoxide inhibits the red blood cells’ ability to
carry oxygen throughout the body—and stays in your system for as long
as six hours after your last cigarette. All of these effects cut down on
your “wind” and so prevent you from becoming the swimmer you might
be. I strongly urge you to give up smoking as part of your fitness
program. Swimming can help you here, by reducing tension, and by
giving you a glimpse of what healthy lungs, filled with clean air, feel
like.
Q: What’s synchronized swimming? Where can I find out more about it?
A: Synchronized swimming is the competitive form of water ballet,
which you may have seen in Esther Williams films. It’s like figure skating
in the water. Here, stroke variations with “figures” similar to gymnastic
stunts are combined to form a graceful routine to musical
accompaniment. It’s beautiful to watch and fun to try. I’ve included a
few water exercises (this page) that are also synchronized swimming

workout skills; these are excellent for developing upper body strength.

Q: Does caffeine affect my swimming?
A: It may—but exactly how depends on your own body chemistry. It
may raise your heart rate, make you jittery, short of breath, even
lightheaded. On the other hand, you might be the type (like me) who
does well with caffeine coursing through your veins.
Why? In an article in the June 1978 RunnersWorld, Dr. David Costill,
an exercise physiologist at Ball State University, recommended two cups
of coffee taken about one hour before exercise, because research found
that this caused a 19 percent increase in the length of time needed to
reach exhaustion. In another study, caffeine taken two hours before
exercise increased the amount of work performed by 7 percent. The
reason is apparently that caffeine increases the amount of fat burned for
energy (40 percent as opposed to 22 percent without caffeine), which
lessens the amount of glycogen used by the muscle cells, which, in turn,
forestalls exhaustion.
Q: Will swimming give me bulky muscles?
A: No. Swimming is an exercise that results in smooth, firm, elongated
muscles. If you want more bulk and “definition” you need to do more
dry-land exercises such as running, calisthenics, and particularly weight

lifting.
Q: Am I too old, obese, or uncoordinated to swim?
A: No! Everyone, whatever his or her age, weight, or level of ability
(or sex, color, creed, national origin, or political persuasion), can enjoy
the lifetime benefits of swimming!

UST FOR UN
Throw these fascinating facts around at the next pool party.
Q: Where did the idea of swimming pools come from?
A: For centuries, natural bodies of water were the only swimming
facilities available. The eighteenth century, however, added a new
wrinkle in fresh-and saltwater dipping: “floating swimming baths.”
Popular in England, France and the United States, these were floating
docks in natural water. Eventually they gave way to stationary ones that
stayed put on the beach floor. Landlocked pools finally arrived in this
country, Germany, and England in the middle of the last century.
Q: What are some of the more unusual pools that have been built?
A: There was William Randolph Hearst’s 18-karat gold-lined indoor
pool at San Simeon. And Wilt Chamberlain’s moatlike pool that allowed
visitors the option of either using the front door or swimming right into
a small pool in his living room. Then there were the Hollywood models:
Jayne Mansfield’s heart-shaped hole in the ground, and Liberace’s grand-
piano look-alike.

--- Page 423 Text ---
Q: Where is the world’s largest swimming pool?
A: According to the Guinness Book of World Records, it’s the Orthleib
pool in Casablanca, Morocco: 1,547 feet long and 246 feet wide. This
saltwater pool is especially recommended for lap swimmers who have
trouble keeping count.
Q: How fast are the fastest swimmers?
A: The fastest human swimmers move through the water at 5 to 6
miles an hour. Contrast that with dolphins, which swim up to 24 miles
an hour, and whales, which swim up to 35 miles an hour. (But, as a look
at the records will show, we’re getting faster all the time.)
Q: Where can I see a 12-ton sculpture entitled Swimmer and a 3,200-tile
mosaic depicting King Neptune?
A: At the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale,
Florida. This huge swimming complex devoted to the glory of the sport
contains a pool and diving complex, an auditorium, a film library, the
world’s largest bookstore devoted exclusively to aquatics, and a gift and
souvenir shop where you can buy all sorts of swimming memorabilia-
bumper stickers, T-shirts, post cards, bathing suits, and novelties.
Over forty thousand people visit the Hall of Fame every year—many
to view the major swimming and diving competitions held there, and to
browse through the Hall of Fame’s exhibits devoted to its honorees (such
as Johnny Weissmuller, Buster Crabbe, Gertrude Ederle, and Esther
Williams), to gaze at its treasure trove of memorabilia including Lloyd
Bridges’s Sea Hunt wetsuit, and an elegant 800 Greek bas-relief of
B.C.
swimmers.
Q: Who was the first person to swim across the English Channel?

--- Page 424 Text ---
A: Captain Matthew Webb, in 1875. Since then, hundreds of other
hardy souls have followed in his wake. Gertrude Ederle was the first
woman to cross it, in 1926. The first double crossing was achieved by
Antonio Abertondo, an Argentinian, in 1961; it took him 43 hours and
10 minutes. The fastest single crossing to date was made by Penny Dean,
on July 29, 1978; her time was 7 hours, 40 minutes. The youngest was
Marcus Hooper, age twelve, who made the swim August 5–6, 1979; his
time was 14 hours, 37 minutes.
Q: Who is the greatest swimmer that ever lived?
A: Most people would agree that that title should go to Johnny
Weissmuller, even though his world records were all topped long ago.
Over the course of his career, he won five Olympic gold medals, fifty-one
National Championships—and never lost a single race during his ten-
year career! The record he set in 1927 for the 100-yard freestyle (51
seconds) stood for seventeen years. (Today records rarely hold for more
than seventeen months.)
Q: What about some other remarkable swim personalities?
A: Of course, there’s Mark Spitz, who became an international
celebrity by winning an unprecedented seven gold medals in the 1972
Olympics in Munich. And one of the world’s most impressive marathon
swimmers is Diana Nyad, who has swum around Manhattan Island (28
miles), crossed Lake Ontario (32 miles), swum from Capri to Naples (22
miles), and from the Great Barrier Reef to the Australian Coast (50
miles). In 1979 she was the first person to defy the Gulf Stream by
swimming from the Bahamas to Florida (80 miles).
Duke Kahanamoku, both a freestyle sprinter and a water polo player,
and Juno Stover Irwin, tower and platform diver, were the only
competitors in history to make the U. S. Olympic swimming and diving
teams for four separate Olympics. (Juno also has another unique record
—she mothered a child between each of her Olympic diving stints!)

--- Page 425 Text ---
Coach George Haines holds the distinction of being on the U. S.
Olympic swim coaching staff since 1960, and is recognized as one of
America’s top coaches of the sport. One of Coach Haines’s teams, in fact,
the one that competed in 1976 in Montreal, won every event except one
(the 200-meter breaststroke) in an unprecedented Olympic sweep.

PPENDIX A:
SWIMMERS’ SHAPE-UPS
T
he best way to improve your swimming is to swim. But there are
literally hundreds of exercises, activities, and pieces of equipment that
can help you to improve your strength, endurance, and flexibility as well
as to add variety to your fitness program. So, if you enjoy doing sit-ups,
jumping jacks, push-ups, yoga, bicycle riding, jogging, and so on, by all
means continue to do so.
But remember the principle of “specificity of training”: certain
exercises are especially useful for swimmers because they concentrate on
developing those skills and those areas of the body most important for
swimming. Some of these are done on dry land, others can be done in
the water (water exercises), and some use equipment such as weights
and resistance devices.
Whether you elect to do your own favorite general conditioning
exercises or the swimming-specific exercises described below, or a
combination of both, remember that they’re an adjunct to, not a
replacement for, swimming. You might incorporate a few of them into
the warm-up or cool-down of a swimming workout. Or, on a
nonswimming day, you could do a relatively long dry-land workout
(though many of the shape-ups may also be done in the water, where
buoyancy and water resistance add a new dimension).
The following exercises are mostly light strength-building calisthenics
(ideal for warm-ups) and stretches. Many of the stretches may be done
either as short, easy movements to get the creaks out before a swim or
held as a single, longer position to get a full stretch. The latest research
shows that most people are better off reserving such full stretching for a
dry-land cool-down after the rest of the workout, when stretching will
elongate the fibers of your muscles and counteract their tendency to
tighten up. Stretching after a workout serves two purposes: it helps
prevent stiffness and soreness the next day, and it increases your overall
flexibility, since at this time your body is warm and oxygenated and so

--- Page 429 Text ---
most accommodating. The best full stretch is a long, slow, static one
(that is, held steady with no bouncing), for thirty seconds for each of
two phases. The first phase is an easy stretch, during which you totally
relax while the tension should actually diminish. During the second, or
developmental, phase, you stretch farther, but never so that it’s painful.
Stretching, both in and out of the water, can be an important asset to
your swimming and to your total health. Be careful not to overdo it,
though. Stretching should never be painful. If it is, either stop or stretch
more gently.
L E
AND XERCISES
Tug-of-war (stretches forearms, chest, shoulders, latissimus dorsi, or
“lats”; benefits all strokes): Bend one arm up behind your head and the
other arm down behind your waist. Slide your hands between your
shoulder blades, until the fingers touch. If you can, grasp one hand with
the other and pull gently as in a tug-of-war. Change arm positions. (Use
a handkerchief to extend your reach if you can’t touch hands at first.)
Shoulder Hang (stretches arms, shoulders, and back; benefits all
strokes): Grasp a bar or other sturdy object, with hands shoulder width
apart. Relax and just hang as long as is comfortable.
Trunk Press (stretches chest, shoulders, hamstrings, and back; benefits
all strokes): Bend forward at the hips with a straight back, resting your
hands on the back of a chair. Keep your legs straight as you arch your
back and shoulders up and down like a cat.
Trunk Twisters (good for body roll used in crawl and backstroke):
Stand with hands on your waist; twist your right elbow and trunk to the
left; return to center, then twist to right.
Torso Turn (good for developing body roll, particularly if one side is

--- Page 430 Text ---
not as flexible as the other; helps stretch the shoulders and upper arms):
Face a fixed object such as a diving board ladder or a lifeguard stand,
and grasp it with your left hand at shoulder level. Twist your torso to
look over your right shoulder, feeling the stretch in the front of your
shoulders. Reverse, and repeat.
Knee Bends (strengthens legs for push-offs during dives, starts, and
turns): Stand with hands on your waist (or one hand on chair back for
balance). Bend your knees and go down as far as possible, keeping your
heels planted on the floor.
The Sky Is High “Plyometrics” (strengthens the legs and increases
their explosive power, which is good for starts and turns): Rub some
chalk on the index finger of one hand. Stand next to a wall, facing it.
Bend your knees slightly, then, raising both arms in the air, jump as high
as you can, touching the chalked finger to the wall to mark your height.
Leave the mark for future comparison.
Forward Lunge (stretches and strengthens legs for all kicks, especially
the whip kick): Lunge forward like a fencer, with one foot well in front
of the other. Facing in the direction of the forward foot, press your hips
forward and down toward the floor. Change legs.
Kneeling Arch (stretches toes, feet, and ankles for all kicks; stretches
thighs for the whip kick): Kneel with legs hip width apart. Lean back,
resting your weight on your hands, and gradually continue backward
toward the floor, until your weight is resting on your elbows. Eventually
ease your back onto the floor between your legs, keeping your knees on
the floor.
Bridge (stretches and strengthens back, shoulders, chest, and front of
thighs; good for all strokes, especially the butterfly and the backstroke):
Lying on your back, bend your knees and place your feet on the floor

--- Page 431 Text ---
under your buttocks. Push your hips off the floor to rest your weight on
your shoulders, rolling up through the pelvis and lower back. If you can,
place your hands palms down under your shoulders and press yourself
all the way up into a full arch, resting your weight on your hands and
feet. Roll down slowly.
Lower Back Arch (stretches lower back for dolphin kick): Lying face
down, bend your elbows and place your hands palms down under your
shoulders. Push up, arching your back and looking up, keeping the pelvis
down. Roll down slowly.
Toe Touching (stretches back and hamstrings; benefits all strokes):
Sitting on the floor, legs together in front of you, bend forward at the
waist to touch your toes. Eventually try to straighten your back and
touch your chest to your thighs.
Ankle Circles (good for all kicks; encourages whipping action): In a
sitting position, rotate your feet from the ankle, aiming for full motion.
Do one ankle at a time, first clockwise, then counterclockwise. Switch
ankles.
Ankle Rocking (for additional ankle flexibility; good for all kicks):
Kneel on the floor, legs together, with the tops of your feet against the
floor. Sit down on heels; rest your hands on your knees, stretching the
toes and ankles by rocking forward and backward gently.
Resistance Devices for Swimmers
The dominance of the East German swimmers in the 1972 Olympics
began to focus the spotlight on the benefits of weight training. Though
we aren’t all Kornelia Ender, weight training, when used properly, can
result in the added strength needed for increased speed and endurance
for all strokes and distances.

--- Page 432 Text ---
In weight training, you pit your strength against gravity, in the form
of a free weight, such as dumbbells or barbells; modern stationary weight
machines, such as Universal and Nautilus; pulley devices or stretch cords;
or swim benches and mini-gyms. By gradually increasing the resistance of
such devices and the number of times you move them, you build muscle
strength. Again, apply the principle of specificity of training, and
concentrate on exercises that will most help your swimming. For
swimming, it’s best to use relatively light resistance and relatively high
numbers of repetitions (eight to twelve) within each set. Gradually
increase the number of sets to three, with a thirty-second rest between.
Pulleys and Stretch Cords: Pulleys, which are often available at gyms
and health clubs, are cords attached to movable weights that slide up
and down along a channel. Stretch cords, one length of elastic cord with
a handle on either end, are an outgrowth of pulleys, and are inexpensive
and easy to make. (To make your own, buy a length of surgical tubing
approximately twice as long as you are tall. Make a loop handle at each
end simply by doubling it back on itself and tying a knot. When you’re
ready to use it, slip it through or around a stationary object such as an
eyescrew, doorknob, pole, railing, or poolside fence.)
You can use pulleys and stretch cords in a similar way. Grasp one
handle in each hand. Then, for example, you can bend over at the waist
and simulate all of the swimming arm motions, keeping elbows high and
concentrating on the accelerated phase 2 of each stroke. As you pull
through your stroke using stretch cords, the tension increases; for more
tension and a more difficult arm pull, stand farther away from where it
is fixed. A good rule of thumb is to still be able to feel some resistance
during the part of the stroke cycle when your hands are all the way
forward. Here, more repetitions can be done—approximately twenty per
set, three sets per stroke, at a faster pace than you would swim.
The Exer-Genie is a device consisting of a cylinder through which a
rope passes, like a portable pulley. The adjustable tension, which is
created by friction on the rope, is especially good for practicing your
arm stroke pulls.

--- Page 433 Text ---
Mini-Gym and Isokinetic Swim Bench: This whole line of resistance
equipment, designed especially for swimmers, lets you move your arms
through a full range of swimming motions. The resistance automatically
adjusts to the force applied by your muscles (an isokinetic exercise), so
that, as your arms tire and your pull weakens, the resistance also
decreases, thereby lessening the chance of injury. The Vasa-Trainer and
the Isokinetic Swim Bench, outgrowths of the Mini-Gym concept, have
digital gauges that measure the force of your pull.
Free Weights and Universal and Nautilus Machines: The principle
behind all three of these systems is similar, each one having certain
advantages. Individuals can easily buy or even make their own free
weights—barbells and dumbbells. This equipment is also common at Ys,
health clubs, gyms, and fitness centers. Swimmers should do tricep
extensions, bench presses, bicep curls, seated presses, straight-arm pull-
overs, knee bends (if your knees permit), leg presses, rowing exercises,
wrist curls, and other exercises that strengthen the muscles used in
swimming. Use of free weights provides certain advantages not found in
all other weight-training systems. Their use requires balance, develops
neurological coordination, permits free acceleration and deceleration
during exercise movement, and allows for a full range of motion and an
almost infinite variety of movements.
The Universal Gym and other similar systems are large, multi-exercise
systems of stationary weight-lifting apparatus. Their advantages over
free weights are the easily adjustable resistance, the large number of
exercises that can be done on one piece of equipment, and the reduced
danger of falling weights. Although you can’t accomplish a full range of
swimming motions, you can use Universal to strengthen important
swimming muscle groups.
Nautilus, now one of the standards in weight training, is another
alternative. Although you still can’t perform swimming motions,
Nautilus does allow you to isolate and strengthen individual muscle
groups. It’s also unique in that it utilizes a cam device that enables the

--- Page 434 Text ---
resistance to vary with the degree of muscle contraction. Thus, it
provides resistance throughout the movement—at the beginning, middle,
and end. An added plus is that the apparatus allows you to move
through a full range of motion.
There are over twelve hundred fitness centers in America that feature
Nautilus equipment, including many health clubs. The Nautilus hip and
back, pull-over, and tricep-extension machines are the best for
swimmers. The chest press, leg press, shoulder press, arm curl, wrist
curl, leg extension, leg curl, and pull down are also good.

ATER EROBICS
Sometimes conditions just aren’t ideal for a swimming workout. The
pool may be too crowded to swim laps comfortably. You may be away
from home and have only a mini-pool available. Maybe you have a cold
and don’t want to put your head in the water. You could have an injury
that restricts the use of your arms and legs. Or perhaps you’re just ready
for a change of pace, or a way to vary your warm-ups or cool-downs.
That’s the perfect time to try a new approach to body conditioning:
water exercises. These special exercises are designed to take advantage
of the water’s buoyancy and resistance. Unlike swimming, they keep you
relatively in one place. And water exercises can be done by virtually
anyone, at any level: by nonswimmers, beginning swimmers, and
advanced swimmers, by super athletes and by those who are just at the
beginning of a fitness program. Some of these are more difficult than
others, and many are based on exercises I do to practice synchronized
swimming. Others are slow, easy stretches ideal for relaxing, or as the
perfect finale to a fitness swim. Many can be done in chest-deep water,
and should be repeated for between thirty seconds and two minutes
each. If done as a stretch, the water exercise should be done in the same
way as a dry-land stretch: in two phases, first an easy one, followed by
the more demanding developmental stretch.
Wall Kicking (tones the lower body; strengthens arms and chest;
aerobic benefits if you do it long enough): This exercise, described

--- Page 435 Text ---
earlier in the book, consists of holding on to the pool wall and practicing
the flutter kick, scissors kick, whip kick, or dolphin kick in either prone
or supine position.
Stationary Pulling (tones arms and shoulders; tightens buttocks;
practices arm motions of the various strokes): In a prone position, hook
your feet over pool gutter. Practice the arm motions of the various
strokes, using rhythmic breathing, alternate breathing, and controlled
breathing.
Stationary Swimming: There are tethered swim devices available that
harness your body to a line that prevents you from moving through the
water, and so allows you to swim in place. If you’re handy, you can
make your own stationary swim harness and affix it to a pool ladder.
Bobbing (good all-round strengthener and toner for the lower body—
and possibly the upper body, depending on the variation used; aerobic
benefits if you add a jumping action and do it long enough): Bobbing has
many variations—your head can stay above the water or can submerge
with each bob; you can raise and lower arms as you bob; or you might
add jumping action—either in place or moving forward, to side, or
backward. All bobbing is based on the simple knee bend: bend your
knees as you go down, and straighten them as you come up. This is the
basis of “plyometrics.”
Alternate your legs front and back in a wide lunging position,
front leg bent and back leg straight.
Bob on one leg, keeping the other bent close to chest; reverse
legs.
Bob with both knees facing out to the side and away from each
other (like a plié).
Treading (all-over toning; aerobic benefits if done long and vigorously
enough): This is a kind of vertical swimming; do it in water that’s deep
enough so that your toes don’t hit bottom. As with bobbing, there are

--- Page 436 Text ---
many variations:
Regular treading (see this page) is a wide, horizontal scull for
the arms combined with a bicycle leg motion.
Tread with a frog or scissors kick instead of the bicycle leg
motion.
Tread using dolphin kick.
Tread, turning your feet inward toward the center of your body
(“the egg beater”).
Using any kick, lift alternate arms vertically out of the water;
then lift both simultaneously. When you need to rest, do so in
the prone position with limbs relaxed; then continue.
Tug-of-war: starting with your back to pool wall for support,
practice sculling with your palms facing up—this “support
sculling” will cause your body to move downward. Then move
away from wall and add the “egg-beater” kick, which will tend
to push you upward and counteract the downward “tug” of the
support sculling.
Sculling (tones arms, chest muscles and abdomen, buttocks, back,
thighs and/or calves, depending on the variations used; aerobic benefits
if done long enough): This is a small figure-8 motion done with the
hands near the hips, usually while in a stationary supine position (see
this page). Keep legs straight and your toes pointed to prevent your body
from “sitting” in the water.
Place both feet on the edge of the deck, legs straight, with your
body in a supine position. Scull while you lift each leg
alternately, so that it forms a right angle with the water and
with your body (the other leg remains straight, your foot
resting on the deck to help support you). Eventually, try to do
this exercise without the wall for support.
Repeat the above exercise, lifting both legs at the same time.
Leg Sweep (stretches and tones the whole leg, the buttocks, and the
lower back): Stand with one side to the pool wall, holding on to it with
the nearer arm. Lift one leg forward and up. Straighten and extend the

--- Page 437 Text ---
leg. Bring the leg straight down, through the standing position, then as
far in back of you as possible, keeping your legs straight. Return the leg
to a standing position. Repeat with the other leg.
Leg Circle (tones and stretches thighs and buttocks; stretches lower
back): Face the pool wall, holding on with both hands. Bring one leg out
to side, knee straight. Bend your knee and twist the leg around behind
you, trying to touch your toes to the wall on your other side. Repeat an
equal number of times with each leg.
Lower Leg Press (stretches calves and lower legs): Stand in chest-deep
water, facing the pool wall, with your arms extended in front of you and
your hands grasping the gutter. Bend one leg and place your foot flat on
the bottom in front of you, keeping the other leg straight behind you.
Slowly move your body forward until you feel a stretch in the calf of
your straight leg. Reverse legs.
Wall Push-ups (strengthens arms, shoulders, and back; this is also a
good way to exit the pool): Face the wall and rest your palms on the
deck edge, your hands shoulder width apart and your elbows bent. Bend
your knees and jump up, straightening your arms and lifting your body
so that your thighs rest on the deck edge. Contract your body and hold
for five seconds. Variation: do the exercise with your back to the wall.
Sit-ups (tones abdominal and leg muscles): With your back to the wall,
grasp the edge or gutter as though you were doing a supine flutter-kick
drill. Bend and lift both legs together, tucking your knees to your chest.
(You can also do this in a supine position, holding a kickboard over your
abdomen.) Repeat continuously.
Side-winders (strengthens the abdominals, legs, inner and outer
thighs): Standing with your back to wall, grasp the gutter edge. Lift your
legs in front of you, keeping them straight and together, until they are

--- Page 438 Text ---
level with the water surface. Then sweep your right leg to the right,
trying to touch the wall. Sweep your left leg to the right to meet it.
Repeat on the other side.
Push-away (tones and stretches legs, buttocks, entire back, arms,
shoulders): Face the wall, grasping the gutter with both hands. Bend
your knees and place both feet flat against the wall just below the water
level (backstroke-start position). Try to straighten your legs; hold for
fifteen to thirty seconds.
Leg Stretch (stretches the hamstrings): Repeat the above exercise,
working the legs individually by placing one on the pool bottom as far
back behind you as possible, as you straighten the other one.
Side Stretch (tones and stretches inner thigh, sides, shoulders): Stand
with one side to the wall. Raise the near leg in front of you and hook the
foot over the gutter. Keeping both legs straight, bend at the waist and
stretch and try to touch the raised foot with the opposite hand. Repeat
on opposite side.
Loop-the-Loop (back stretch; helps backstroke start; improves breath
control): Face the wall, grasping the edge with both hands. Bend your
knees toward your chest and place your feet flat on the wall at water
level (backstroke start position). Spring away from the wall by
straightening your legs; extend your arms overhead and arch your back.
Enter the water in a back dive; then continue in a smooth, circular
motion until your hands touch bottom. Maintaining an arched,
streamlined body position, push off the bottom with your hands and
complete the circle as you emerge from the water. (This should be done
in water at least six feet deep, for safety’s sake.)
Arm Circles (tones upper arms and shoulders): Crouch in the water so
that your arms and shoulders are submerged. Make tiny circles with both

--- Page 439 Text ---
arms, first forward, then backward. (Use hand paddles for more
resistance.)
Arch and Stretch (stretches arms, shoulders, and back): In chin-deep
water, stand with your back to the wall, your heels close to it. Reach
behind you and grasp the gutter. Then lean forward, look up, and arch
your chest, pushing your hips forward. Ease into this position, then hold
it for fifteen to thirty seconds. When this part is easy for you, try to
“walk” your feet up the wall, keeping your legs straight for more stretch.
Arm Arcs (tones arms and shoulders; stretches chest and shoulders):
Stand or crouch so that your arms and shoulders are submerged. Extend
your arms in front of you, palms down. Press them down and back in a
semicircular motion, until the hands reach the surface behind you. Then
rotate your arms so that the hands are palms down again, and arc the
arms forward to the starting position. (Using hand paddles increases the
effect of the water’s resistance.)
Finale Stretches (for arms, shoulders, back, and chest; these feel
especially good after a workout): In a prone or supine position, interlace
your fingers, palms turned away from you, and stretch overhead—first to
one side, then to the other, then straight overhead. Another variation is
to stand in chest-deep water; interlace your fingers behind your back,
palms facing toward you. Keeping your arms straight, bring them up as
high as they’ll go.
There are also many new types of resistance equipment to be used in
the water. You may want to experiment with them to vary your
workouts.

trainers, and runners for rehabilitation because deep-water aerobics
provides them with the opportunity to maintain their physical
conditioning and specificity of training while preventing overuse injury.
Flotation devices are generally used with deep-water exercise in order
to provide a “neutral buoyancy” position to keep your chin out of the
water. This enables you to jog in deep water, and concentrate on
running form, regardless of your swimming ability. Most notable among
these devices are the rubber flotation belts, like the “AquaJogger” and
the “Wet Vest,” a lightweight, snug-fitting vest made of neophrene,
which keeps you upright as well as buoyant. A tether rope can also be
attached to a poolside anchor and can allow you to jog in a small
shallow or deep area, and to simulate sprint running in the water.
Samples of deep water exercises include:
Deep-water Running
Keep your elbows close to your body, moving your arms in opposition to
your legs. Maintain your body posture, and practice your running form.
Hurdles
Simulate running a hurdle course. Begin with your knees together under
your body. Then your front leg extends straight forward, and your rear
leg is bent behind you. Return to the bent-knee position under your
body, and repeat with opposite leg forward.
Cross-country Skiing
Simulate cross-country skiing with arms and legs in opposition. Aim for
increased range of motion, forward and back; keep your range of motion
as extended and equidistant as possible.
Training Tips: With a pace clock or wristwatch, count the number of

--- Page 441 Text ---
strides you take in a given time period (cadence check). Rest, repeat, and
try to increase the number each time. You can also Interval train by
simulating a running workout with sets of fast and slow runs (fartlek
method).
In addition to conventional pools, compact pools with artificial
currents, as well as one-lane lap pools (both shallow and deep), extend
possibilities for water aerobics, and are a consideration for homeowners.

SAFE SWIMMING

very swimming pool, beach, or watering hole is unique. Become
familiar with your surroundings every time you’re in a new situation.
Realize that, even if there is a lifeguard, you are an extra pair of eyes.
The first and best rule to remember is to use common sense, and try not
to panic in case of emergency. For more information on water safety,
contact your local American National Red Cross chapter on the U. S.
Coast Guard. The Red Cross and the Ys also teach lifesaving courses.
Here are some water safety tips:
Never swim alone—there should be at least one other person
around at all times. Half the people who drown were swimming
alone.
Avoid alcoholic beverages when swimming (or boating)—
nearly half of the people who drown have alcohol in the
bloodstream.
In open water, check with the lifeguard or beach patrol for
information about tides, currents, depths, and so on. Don’t
guess.
If you’re a shallow-water swimmer, observe the water-depth
markers.
Obey posted rules and regulations; swim or dive only in
designated areas.
Make sure there are no swimmers nearby before you jump or
dive into the water. Only one person should use a diving
platform at a time. Always be aware of other swimmers around
you to avoid collisions.

--- Page 443 Text ---
Swim after dark only if the area is properly lit and if a buddy or
lifeguard is present.
Avoid eating a heavy meal before swimming strenuously.
Don’t jump into cool water if you’re overheated, since this may
cause cramps. Cool off first.
If you do get a cramp, stretch the muscle and knead the area
with your thumb, alternating direct pressure and release until
the cramp goes away.
Only trained lifesavers should attempt a swimming rescue.
However, you can help with nonswimming rescues in the
following way: extend a pole, branch, leg, arm, oar, towel, or
article of clothing to the victim. As you pull him or her to
safety, stay low, keeping your weight back to prevent being
pulled into the water yourself. If the swimmer is farther away,
toss a life preserver (or anything that floats) to support him or
her as you call for help. Even non-swimmers can save a life this
way. The last thing even qualified rescuers do is jump into the
water; and just because you may know some components of
rescue-life skills, such as the scissors kick, it doesn’t mean that
you are qualified to attempt a rescue.
Leave the water as soon as you feel chilly. Numb or blue fingers
and toes mean you’ve been in too long, and can signal the
approach of hypothermia.
SCUBA diving (Self-Contained Underwater Breathing
Apparatus) is not the same as swimming. So before you venture
out into Jacques Cousteau territory, take a course of
instruction. (Skin diving—the use of fins, mask, and snorkel—
can be learned relatively quickly.)
Get training in basic first aid and cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(the ABC’s of CPR).

PECIAL WIMS
Once you’re swimming regularly, you may want to keep track of your
progress and set some long-term goals for yourself. Competitive
swimming is one way to do this. Here are several alternatives.
The American National Red Cross 50-Mile Swim and Stay Fit
Program: As the Red Cross says, it’s “not a marathon, not a race, not
competitive, not an endurance contest”; this is simply a very satisfying
way the Red Cross has designed to encourage regular swimming. You
simply keep a running total of the number of miles you’ve swum to date,
by filling in each swim on a chart posted at your pool. This self-
administered program is run on the honor system, although there may
be a “pool monitor.” Usually, the fifty miles are accomplished quite
gradually; if you do it in 440-yard (quarter-mile) segments, it would
amount to 200 swims, or about 70 weeks. The Red Cross awards wallet-
sized certificates in 10-mile units; at the end of the 50 miles, you get a
larger certificate. For a small fee, you can also obtain a pin and a patch
to commemorate your feat. Many swimmers complete the distance, then
enroll again to try to finish in less time.
28-Mile Manhattan Island and 300-Mile Three-Island Swims:
Manhattan is a nice place to visit, you say, but you wouldn’t want to
swim around it. This cumulative swim converts your own pool mileage
into an imagined trip around Manhattan Island. A longer version, the

--- Page 445 Text ---
300-mile “Three-Island Swim” (around Manhattan, Staten Island, and
Long Island), works the same way. Both of these swims are sponsored by
the Greater New York American Red Cross Chapter. An accompanying
map (on this page) notes various attractions for the “Three-Island
Swim.” Try it, you’ll like it!
Your Personalized Swim and Stay Fit Program: You can make up
your own program of whatever distance you like. Swim to your sister’s
house on the other side of town, around your state, down the
Mississippi, or to Rome—all on paper. For her famous swim, Dr. Joyce
Brothers decided to “swim” to her daughter’s college.
Swim-a-thons for raising cash: In addition to neighborhood cake
sales, swim for dollars to raise money for your favorite charity.
Participating swimmers (of all ages and levels) can go out and hustle up
financial support in the form of pledges from sponsors.
The International Swimming Hall of Fame (address on this page) will
help you sponsor a swim-a-thon in your community.
Distance and Timed Swims: (Half-hour and One-hour Postal Swims):
This event, the object of which is to see who can swim the greatest
distance in an hour, gives you the opportunity to compete without the
expense and inconvenience of traveling to a meet. After your swim, in
any 25-yard or 50-meter pool, you simply mail in the results on an
official entry blank for tabulation (hence the term “postal swim”). You
can swim either as an individual or as part of a team. Meet results and
awards will be mailed to you. These Masters postal swims are held
annually, and others are cropping up.
