Introduction
inTroduCTion
It was when I was about twelve, that I figured out swimming really agreed with me,
and for the next twelve years competitive swimming was a central part of my life.
My identity was to a large extent defined by swimming. My schedule revolved
around training and swim meets. My daily routine was to rise before dawn and ride
my bike, along with my sisters single file through the streets of Berkeley, California,
pedaling the slight but steady uphill grade to swim practice at the YMCA where in
that 20-yard basement pool we swam a two-hour workout before school, and
another one after school.
I worked hard at those practices, accomplishing lots of swimming and thereby
achieving a superior level of conditioning. I also developed very efficient strokes,
partially by necessity–to make it through those tough practices–but also because of
my coaches’ focus on honing of the mechanics of swimming. In addition to the
countless 200s I would do on a daily basis, there were a variety of technique drills
that used to annoy me to no end. Thinking back, I can remember drills that applied
to body position, kick, arm stroke and recovery, breathing, leverage and coordina-
tion. But at the time, I had no patience for drills... probably because I didn’t under-
stand them.
I was one of those “thinking swimmers” with the distinct need to understand the
purpose of each set we were assigned, as opposed to the kind of swimmer who
simply trusts that the coach knows best. “How exactly is this exercise going to make
me a better swimmer?” I recall asking my coach, to which he would simply reply,
“Ready, go!”
So I would push off and do the drill of the day, lap after lap, convinced I was wast-
ing precious practice time, but eventually realizing improvements to my stroke

efficiency through all that repetition. I
often wonder what would have become
of my swimming if I had understood the
purpose of each drill before pushing off.
Now that I am coaching swimming, I
make a big deal of the mind/body con-
nection. I want each swimmer to under-
stand the goal of every drill before
doing it. I spend a lot of time defining
the purpose of each exercise, describing
the desired outcome so the athlete has
a clear mental picture before pushing
off the wall. I feel strongly that an ath-
lete whose mind is as involved in the act
of swimming as his or her body is, will
improve more steadily because he or she
is prepared to absorb the full benefit of
the drill, and is further prepared to put
into use the technique the drill brings
forward.
The goal of a drill is not to do it then
leave it behind, but to do it and then
incorporate it into one’s swimming. To
best accomplish this, the swimmer has
to understand what he or she is trying
to achieve in the first place.

Introduction
This book is a sequel to “The 100 Best Swimming Drills,” (Meyer & Meyer Sport,
2006), which has been used by swimmers around the world. This second drill book
follows the same format as the first and gives swimmers and coaches even more
variety of drills with which to use to improve swimming technique.
This volume contains drills for each of the competitive strokes, and for specific
aspects of each of these strokes. Accompanying each drill are diagrams and photos
to help the swimmer visualize what the goal of the particular drill is while doing it.
Drill feedback charts follow each drill to help work through rough spots.
As you work your way through the drills in this book, the key word is focus. It’s all
about thinking and swimming. If you find yourself losing focus, take a break. Start
again later. If one drill doesn’t seem to work for you, try it a few more times, but
don’t get frustrated and stop completely, just move on to another drill. Maybe go
back to that one that you just can’t get after you finish all the other drills. Every
drill does not make sense to every swimmer. That is why there are a hundred drills!
Above all, have fun becoming a better swimmer.

How To use THis book
START TO FINISH
This book is designed for a swimmer interested in improving his or her swimming
skills all around to start at the beginning and build the various elements of one
stroke, from float through coordinated action, and then move on to the next stroke,
again practicing and building each element one upon another. The reader can work
through the four competitive strokes, starting with freestyle, then proceed to back-
stroke, breaststroke, and finally the elusive butterfly!
The strokes are presented in this order because many concepts central to the drills
in the Freestyle section, including correct floatation, productive kicking and arm
stroke acceleration will be helpful in achieving skills in the other strokes. In addition,
although the muscle development that occurs through practicing each particular is
slightly unique, practicing all the strokes gives the swimmer the most well rounded
strength development that will be beneficial to swimming in general. Lastly, many
swimmers will discover that a stroke they have previously avoided because it felt
slow or awkward will become their new favorite stroke as they learn to perform it
with the correct technique and coordination.
FOCUS ON A SINGLE STROKE
Swimmers interested in only a particular stroke can start at that stroke section and
work their way through the drills pertaining to that stroke, from float to coordina-
tion, simple to complex. Swimmers who want to focus on improving one certain
aspect of a particular stroke, will be able to flip to that particular section and find
a variety of drills to work on a certain troublesome stroke element.

how to use this book
Swimmers using this book in this last way will find it helpful to follow up drill prac-
tice for a particular element, such as arm stroke or kick, with the drills presented in
that stroke section for leverage and coordination. The reasoning behind this is that
once a swimmer improves one element of their stroke, the stroke fits together a bit
differently, either because of changes in the timing or momentum. Therefore it is to
the swimmer’s advantage to practice putting all the stroke elements together again
to get the most out of their improved skill in the area of emphasis.
BRING THIS BOOK TO THE POOL
Whichever way you want to use this book, start by reading the drill(s) you are focus-
ing on thoroughly. Read them more than once. Look at the diagrams and photos so
you have a picture in your mind of what you are trying to do before you do it. Then
take the book with you to practice. Refer to it. Get it wet!
Practice a lot. Practice over several days and weeks. Most drills are awkward, even
uncomfortable at first. It is only through practice that they start to feel more natu-
ral. It is only when a drill starts feeling natural that it can start making sense and
help you make improvements to your swimming.
Between practice sessions, use the Drill Feedback Charts that follow each drill,
diagram and photo to work through stumbling blocks. The problems included in
these charts represent the most common trouble spots that can frustrate a swim-
mer’s progress in achieving the full benefit of a particular drill. Accompanying each
common problem are modifications to help the swimmer stay on track. Remember
that making modifications is part of the learning process. Quality practice is key to
improving stroke technique. Strive to learn and practice each drill correctly for it to
have a positive impact on your stroke. Finally, the observations and feedback of a
trusted coach can be valuable in making the most out of every drill.

THe quesT
for beTTer swimming
Swimming is a sport for patient athletes. It takes time and focus to learn good
technique, and time and dedication to get strong enough to maintain good tech-
nique for any distance. Instant gratification is not often experienced in competitive
swimming. But, with patience, focus and dedication the rewards of better swimming
will come.
PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT?
Practice is a key element in improving swimming technique. And frequent practice
has been shown to increase the rate of improvement. Further, in swimming, where
forward motion is achieved through repetitive stroke actions, it is essential to use
correct technique while practicing the series of actions that make up the stroke. If
you practice poor stroke mechanics, you learn poor stroke mechanics. In swimming
like most things, it is quite difficult to un-learn bad habits. So, the saying “practice
makes perfect” is not exactly correct. What is more accurate is to say, “perfect prac-
tice makes perfect”.
WHAT’S THE POINT?
When doing drill work to improve swimming, it is very important to understand the
point of each drill you are doing. Know what you are trying to achieve. Know what
the drill is supposed to emphasize. Know what improvements you are supposed to
feel through the drill. Focus on these things the entire time you are practicing.

The quest for better swimming
Doing drill work without this focus will not help you improve effectively because you
do not have a clear goal in mind. It is mindless swimming, and although sometimes
it’s relaxing to be on auto-pilot when you swim, you must be alert and focused to
get good results from drill work.
WHAT TO FOCUS ON
Body Position
Body position is the foundation of good swimming. Time and effort devoted to
developing the best body position possible is well spent. An ideal float eliminates
a great deal of drag and positions the swimmer to get the most out of arm stroke
and kick, and to produce more leverage. Without a good float position a swimmer
will work harder for less return.
Kick
Being a strong kicker makes you a stronger swimmer. Good kickers depend on flex-
ibility and foot speed. Good kickers tend to have well developed endurance that can
give them an edge. The power added to the stroke by the lower limbs can make the
difference between winning a race or not. In addition the kick also adds balance to
the rest of the stroke, and provides an important rhythmic element.

Arm Stroke
In every stroke except for breaststroke, the arm stroke provides most of the potential
power in swimming, making it a priority among all stroke elements to develop, refine
and perfect. For the purposes of this book, when the term arm stroke is used, it refers
to the propulsive part of the arm cycle, that is, the part where the arm is in the water.
Key points of the arm stroke include the catch, the path of the hand, elbow position
and acceleration from front to back. These are some of the primary elements of the arm
stroke that affect swimming efficiency and speed. As well as forward motion, the arm
stroke contributes to stroke alignment and balance to the rest of the swimming effort.
Recovery
The arm stroke recovery is an often-misunderstood element of the swimming stroke.
While the recovery is the most visible part of the arm stroke, as it happens out of
the water (except for breaststroke), its contribution to forward motion is minor.
Therefore spending a great deal of time and attention fashioning the look of this
part of the stroke is not a high priority. Instead, attention should be paid to the
balancing effect that the recovery has on the rest of the stroke. In addition, as the
name “recovery” implies, this is the time that the arms can rest, so developing a
relaxed recovery where rest can truly be achieved should be a main focus.
Breathing
Breathing in swimming, like any athletic effort is essential to keep the muscles
fueled. But more so than any other sport, breathing while swimming is limited by
the fact that the face is mostly in the water. Therefore breathing in swimming must
become an integral part of the stroke action, incorporated seamlessly into the line
of the stroke. Because poor breathing technique can halt forward motion by inter-
rupting the flow of the stroke, it should be a priority to develop good breathing
technique that works within the silhouette and rhythm of the stroke.

The quest for better swimming
Leverage
Unique to our sport is the way swimmers create forward motion from a floating
position, without the benefit of the ground used by land athletes to provide stability
and to create traction. Swimmers must create the leverage effect within their bodies
and learn to produce effective and ongoing leverage to realize the most efficient
forward motion while floating.
Coordination
The effectiveness of the many actions of swimming can either enhance each other
or fight each other. The best swimmers have discovered how to sequence and com-
bine these various actions so that each individual action works in a chain reaction
to enhance the way the body moves forward in the water.

The quest for better swimming
IS YOUR TECHNIQUE “GOOD ENOUGH?”
I have frequently heard, “I just wanna swim!” as a coach. Some swimmers choose
to skip over drill work either due to time constraints, or because they think that
conditioning is a more important use of their time. Others view their swimming time
as a chance to relax. The problem is that due to the repetitive nature of swimming,
imperfect technique practiced again and again becomes habit, and can slow a swim-
mer’s progress, and even keep the swimmer from reaching his or her potential.
In addition, stroke problems are a main cause of injury in swimmers. Even the most
developed swimmer has stroke flaws that, if repeated over and over, can cause
injury. For the same reason, it is very important that less experienced swimmers
learn correct technique and practice swimming correctly before they try to tackle big
workouts. Everyone can improve their swimming technique... and everyone should,
both to see their full potential, and, to avoid developing a technique-based injury
that can keep a swimmer out of the pool for months.
EXPERIENCE THE PROCESS
The process of improving your swimming requires patience. Improvements rarely
happen instantaneously. For those of us who are looking for instant gratification,
this may be a challenge. Often it takes several days or even weeks of repeating a
drill, or series of drills before you see and feel results. During those days or weeks
frequent practice is an important part of the learning process. Keep a clear picture
in your mind of what you are trying to achieve. Think about it while you are per-
forming the drills, and again afterwards.
All the time you devote to technique drills is cumulative. One day’s work will build
a foundation for the next day’s work. Be determined in your quest, and be sure to
celebrate every breakthrough!

wHaT’s in a drill?
Drill work involves performing a routine or exercise that emphasizes correct tech-
nique through repetition, exaggeration, contrast and/or example. Drills often
require the swimmer to perform only a part of a swimming stroke in order to focus
on a specific skill or movement.
Through practice, the drill becomes more natural for the swimmer to perform.
Only at that point, can the swimmer expect it to “rub off” on their regular swim-
ming stroke.
WORKING WITH DRILLS
You will see quantitative change and qualitative change when working with drills.
At first you may only be able to perform the drill for a few seconds.
Gradually, through practice you will find it possible to perform the same drill for
several minutes at a time. Or, at first you may not even get to the end of the pool
doing a drill for the first time, but over time you will be able to accomplish multiple
laps. Likewise, at first a drill will be so awkward that you just don’t go anywhere. Yet
with patience and practice soon you will be performing the drill with ease.
Drills work over time through multiple stages of psychomotor learning. There is no
set time each stage will take. Every one is different. In order, the stages are:
Mechanics: The step-by-step movements which, like a new dance routine, are awk-
ward and slow at first, but through practice become more comfortable and fluid
to perform
Discovery: The instance when you actively begin to feel the point of the drill while
you are doing it

Understanding: The stage when you can perform the drill seamlessly with the goal
clearly in mind

USING SWIMMING DRILLS
In Warm Up
After loosening up the muscles with a few laps of relaxed, progressive swimming,
drills can be successfully merged into the warm up. Alternating 50s of drill and
swim works well. Using a series of related drills is also very beneficial to build
towards an efficient stroke. Using drills within a warm up sets the tone for a quality
practice session.
As a Recovery Set
After an intense set at practice, a few easy laps are in order. At that point, a less
intense recovery set should be done. This is the perfect time to fit drill work into the

workout. Not only will a drill set provide a needed break from swimming hard with-
out wasting precious time in the water, it will also give the swimmer the opportunity
to recapture his or her technique after the previous speed-centered set. Sometimes
technique can be sacrificed for speed, especially at the end of a set when the swim-
mer is getting tired. So, using a drill set after one of these hard sets is very
beneficial.
Within Sets
Sometimes it works to incorporate drills into a regular swim set. For instance,
instead of simply doing 5 x 100 freestyle, make the first lap a drill lap, but keep the
same interval as you would for all regular swim. Of course only certain drills would
be appropriate in this case. Some would just not work. Choose a drill that is
designed to do at near swim speed, so the set will be challenging, but doable. This
can be a fun and interesting way for swimmers to accomplish both conditioning
work and technique work at the same time.
Pre-Meet
Pre-meet swimming is an excellent time to bring in drills, both during taper, and
within the meet day warm up. Drills bring the mind into one’s swimming, and focus
it on swimming right. Drills can be grounding if a swimmer gets nervous. Using a
long set of drill/swim laps that include many of the drills that have been especially
meaningful to swimmer is a good way to set a positive tone for the big swim.
Off Season
Off season swimming offers a low pressure atmosphere when many swimmers are
able to focus better on the technique of swimming, than during meet season. Off
season is when many swimmers and coaches choose to use drill work as a primary
element of their workouts.

Drills for freestyle
BODY POSITION DRILLS
Good body position in freestyle makes everything else easier. Working on how to
float better in the water is not a waste of time at any level of the sport. A positive
body position decreases the amount of drag a swimmer produces, improves the
catch, and sets the swimmer up to get the most out of their stroke. Use the following
drills to improve your body position in freestyle.

. TIP FORWARD
The purpose of this drill
• Achieving a downhill floating position
• Understanding how to change your floating position
• Avoiding drag
How to do this drill
step 1: Take a big breath and float face down in the water, arms at your sides.
step 2: Notice that your chest and upper body float higher, while your legs and the
lower body float lower. While this is the natural floating position for most people,
it is not advantageous for swimming. It is like swimming “uphill.” From this uphill
position, your body bumps into a lot of water, creating drag.
step 3: To change this
position into a more
advantageous floating

KICK DRILLS
The flutter kick has the potential of adding significant power to the freestyle stroke.
It also can use up a great deal of energy due to the amount of oxygen consumption
required by the large muscles of the legs. Therefore developing an efficient flutter
kick is essential in order to use your energy resources effectively. Learning to kick
well should be a main priority for a better freestyle stroke. Use the following drills
to improve your kicking technique for freestyle.

. FISH DON’T HAvE KNEES
The purpose of this drill
• Developing a fluid kick
• Learning to use the largest available muscles to kick
• Kicking with your whole leg
How to do this drill
Step 1: Observe a fish moving through the water. Its movement is fluid. It uses very
little energy to produce a lot of forward motion. While human swimmers are not
equipped with a tail as fish are, learning to use our lower limbs like the fish uses its
tail will improve our kicking. One major difference between humans and fish is that
fish do not have knees, allowing them to swim without angles or loss of length as
they sweep the water back and forth.
Step 2: In the water, float face down, arms at your sides and do the flutter kick.
Make your kick about 12 - 15 inches wide, and mostly underwater. Produce a fluid
motion that uses the entire length of the leg. Kick without creating any angles at
your knees, ankles or hips. It should feel and appear as if your legs have no bones.
Step 3: Try it again. Use the large muscles your upper legs to initiate the movement
of the kick, and let it flow down to your feet. Feel a fluid, wave-like kick.

. KICK THE BALL
The purpose of this drill
• Knowing the range of the kick
• Understanding the kick’s power phase and recovery
• Feeling the water with your feet
How to do this drill
Step 1: Stand on the pool deck and place a ball in front of your feet. Prepare to kick
the ball so it would travel about ten feet. Notice that you draw your leg back behind
you as you prepare to kick the ball. Freeze at the point when your leg is drawn back
to its farthest point behind you, just before you would swing it forward to kick the ball.
Step 2: Kick the ball. Freeze at the point when your leg is at its farthest point in
front of you in the kick motion. Notice that it is about the same distance in front of
you as it was behind you. Now, place the ball directly behind your feet. Prepare to
kick the ball behind you so it travels about ten feet. Notice that it is much more
difficult to accomplish than when you kicked the ball forward.
Step 3: Get in the water at a point where it is deeper
than you are tall. Begin to kick flutter kick in a vertical
position. Use a quick enough kicking motion to keep
your face out of the water. Imagine that there is a ball
in front of your foot and you are kicking it with each
leg motion. Now imagine that the ball is behind you.
Try kicking the ball back. Notice that it is much harder
to keep your face out of the water when you are pre-

ARM STROKE DRILLS
The freestyle arm stroke uses the entire range of the swimmer’s reach from front to
back, and a three-dimensional path under the water between the extremes of
the reach.
The underwater phase of the arm stroke includes the entry, extension and catch,
upsweep and finish, which happen in succession and with accelerating speed.
It is important to develop all of these parts to make the most effective arm
stroke. Besides moving the body forward, the arm stroke also provides alignment
and balance to the rest of the stroke. Use the following drills to improve your arm
stroke technique for freestyle.

. OvER THE BARREL
The purpose of this drill
• Practicing a high elbow position
• Developing a good hand entry
• Achieving a solid catch
How to do this drill
Step 1: Stand in the water facing a lane rope. Place your right arm over the lane
rope above the elbow. Extend your arm forward so it is aligned with your shoulder
straight in front of you.
Step 2: From this position, start to trace the path of a freestyle stroke. With the lane
line supporting your arm at the elbow, initiate the arm stroke with your hand and
forearm. Notice that your elbow remains in a stable, high position through these
initial stages of the underwater arm stroke.
Step 3: Try it again without the lane rope. Start your stroke with your fingertips,
hand, wrist and forearm, leaving your elbow as still as possible, and higher in the
water than your hand. It should feel as if your arm is going over a barrel.
Step 4: Try it again. Start your arm stroke by tracing
the outside of an imaginary barrel in front of you. At
the point then your hand, elbow and shoulder are all
aligned on top of each other, then move your whole
arm as a unit back quickly towards the finish of the
stroke, without letting your elbow slip down.

How to do this drill
Step 1: Stand in front of a full-length mirror, arms
extended above your head. Beginning with your left
arm, trace the path of the freestyle arm stroke from
entry to extension and catch to downsweep, upsweep
through the finish near your hip. As the right arm
approaches its starting point, begin to trace the path
of the stroke with your left arm. Continue this for
several cycles.
Step 2: After several complete arm stroke cycles, freeze
one of your arms the next time it reaches the point
where it would enter the water. Notice that your hand
is not pointed straight ahead. Notice that your elbow
is bent.

Now, freeze your arm an instant later in the stroke,
after you push your elbow forward, preparing to catch.
Notice that now your hand is pointing straight ahead. Notice that your elbow has
no bend. Notice that your hand, elbow and shoulder align forward.

. 3D FREESTYLE
The purpose of this drill
• Achieving a sweeping arm stroke
• Making the most of the water within your reach
• Learning to hold on to the water
How to do this drill
Step 1: Before you get into the water, take a moment to think about your underwa-
ter freestyle arm stroke. Can you describe the path it takes? From the point that your
hand enters the water, until the point that it exits the water, how does it travel? How
can you best hold on to the water? Would it be a semi-circle? Would it be a straight
line? Think about how your hand moves and describe it.
Step 2: Now, get in the water and swim several laps of freestyle. Focus on the path
of your hand through the arm stroke on the horizontal plane. From the entry, it
should start wide, then sweep inward under your belly button, then finally out past
your hip.
Step 3: Swim several laps of freestyle
again. Focus on the path of your
hand through the arm stroke on the
vertical plane. From the entry, it
should extend forward then descend
downward to about 45 degrees until
it sweeps upward back towards your
body, then finally travels straight

. ACCELERATE THE ARM STROKE
The purpose of this drill
• Learning to generate speed
• Using momentum
• Keeping hold of the water
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim several laps of freestyle, identifying the various stages of the under-
water arm stroke as they occur in each stroke: entry, extension and catch, down-
sweep, upsweep, finish.
Step 2: Now, try to make each stage faster than the previous one, so at the finish
of each stroke, your hand is traveling the fastest.
Step 3: In order to keep a solid hold on the water, it is necessary to accelerate the
underwater arm stroke from start to finish. If your hand travels the same speed
throughout, you will not be making use of the momentum you have created. Try it
again. Feel your hand speed up through the path of the stroke. Feel the water in
your hand as you do.

RECOvERY DRILLS
Freestyle recovery, or the part of the arm stroke that is out of the water is the only
time in the stroke when your arm can rest from applying pressure to the water. It is
therefore important to make the recovery as effortless as possible to save your
energy for the underwater stroke. Learning to use the muscles of the core to throw
your arm forward accomplishes this, as well as creating a working relationship
between the two arms. Use the following drills to improve your recovery technique
for freestyle.

. TRAILING HAND
The purpose of this drill
• Learning to relax the recovering arm
• Avoiding stressful shoulder rotation
• Developing an effortless recovery
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim freestyle for several laps. Then, focus on your right arm only. Breathe
to the right so you can watch your recovery. Freeze at the point when your elbow
passes your shoulder on the way to the front. Notice where your hand is. Is it in front
of your elbow? Is it lined up with your elbow? Is it trailing behind your elbow?
Step 2: At the point when your elbow and your shoulder are lined up as your arm
travels back to the front in the recovery, your hand should be trailing behind your
shoulder and elbow. Try it again. Swim freestyle, focusing on your right arm as it
recovers. Breathe to the right so you can watch it. Push your elbow forward so that
your hand follows behind it.
Step 3: Swim freestyle again. Focus on your left arm as it recovers. Breathe to the
left so you can watch it. Push your elbow forward so that your hand follows behind
it. Your hand should be relaxed as it trails behind your elbow. Only when your hand
passes your head should you throw it forward, in front of your shoulder.
Step 4: Swim freestyle again. Focus on
both arms during recovery. Feel the
hand of your recovering arm trailing.
Feel it hanging relaxed until it passes

. LOOSE HAND SWING
The purpose of this drill
• Developing an effortless recovery
• Achieving a high elbow recovery
• Aligning your recovery forward
How to do this drill
Step 1: Float face down in the water, with your right arm extended in front of you,
and your left arm at your side. You will find that you tend to float with your left
shoulder higher than your right shoulder. Use the steady flutter kick to produce
forward motion.
Step 2: From this position, lift your left elbow until it points straight up toward the
sky, and your hand hangs down relaxed near your shoulder.
Step 3: Holding your high elbow stable, begin to swing your hand near the surface
of the water, back and forth parallel to your body. Allow it to swing about twelve
inches to the back and twelve inches to the front. Make sure your hand is very
relaxed, both in the fingers and at the wrist. Swing your hand back and forth six times.
Step 4: Switch sides so that you are floating with your left arm extended in front of
you, and your right arm is
at your side. You will tend
to float with your right

BREATHING DRILLS
Breathing in freestyle is a necessary part of the stroke. However, it is also the most
common area that swimmers lose stroke momentum, produce drag and lose align-
ment. One solution is to breathe less frequently, but this is not practical in terms of
accomplishing more than a few laps.
A better solution is to learn to make breathing a seamless element of the stroke that
is accomplished without disrupting the momentum, form or line of the stroke. Use
the following drills to improve your breathing technique for freestyle.

. REACH TO INHALE
The purpose of this drill
• Experiencing the correct timing for breathing
• Developing breathing rhythm
• Holding alignment while breathing
How to do this drill
Step 1: Float face down in the water, with your right arm extended in front of you,
and your left arm at your side. You will find that you tend to float with your left
shoulder higher than your right shoulder. Use the steady flutter kick to produce
forward motion.
Step 2: Continue kicking in this position for twelve kicks, gradually exhaling
through your nose and mouth. After twelve kicks, roll more to your right until your
face clears the water. Inhale. Make sure that your right arm remains extended for-
ward while you inhale. Roll back to your original position. Repeat several times.
Step 3: Try it floating with your left arm extended in front of you. Do twelve kicks
while exhaling gradually, then roll more to the left so your face clears the water
enough to inhale. Check that your left arm remains extended through your inhale.

. BREATHE FROM THE HIPS
The purpose of this drill
• Learning to roll from the hips
• Getting comfortable on your side
• Incorporating the breathing action into your stroke
How to do this drill
Step 1: Stand facing a full-length mirror, arms at your sides. Rotate your left shoul-
der forward, and your right shoulder back, then switch. Continue alternating shoul-
ders, forward and back. Notice that as you do this, your hips stay still.
Step 2: Again standing facing a full-length mirror, arms at your sides, rotate your
left hip forward, and your right hip back, then switch. Continue alternating hips,
forward and back. Notice that as you do this, your shoulders follow the same
movement.
Step 3: In the water, float face down, arms at your sides. Without using your arms
or legs, attempt to roll over to your back, initiating the roll from the shoulders.
Notice that it is quite difficult to make this roll.
Step 4: Try it again. This time use your hips to initiate the roll. Notice that your
shoulders follow you hips and you can easily roll to your back.

. CONSTANT BREATHING
The purpose of this drill
• Learning to avoid holding your breath
• Feeling the continuous exchange of air
• Developing a breathing rhythm
How to do this drill
Step 1: Run at medium speed once around a track. Notice that your breathing falls
into a pattern of rhythmic inhaling and exhaling.
Step 2: Try it again. This time run only about 100 yards at the same speed you used
the first run. Try holding your breath as you run. Only inhale and exhale when you
absolutely have to. Notice that there is little rhythm to your breathing. Notice that
it is not sustainable.
Step 3: Try it in the pool. Swim freestyle at medium speed for 100 yards. Hold your
breath as you swim. Only inhale and exhale when you absolutely have to. Notice
there is little rhythm to your breathing. Notice that it is not sustainable.
Step 4: Now try swimming freestyle at the same speed. Use a breathing rhythm of
every three or four strokes. When your face is in the water, use a gradual exhale so
there is a continuous stream of bubbles flowing from your nose and mouth. Just
before you turn to inhale, give an extra strong puff to empty your lungs, then inhale
quick and deep. Continue this rhythm for 100 yards. Could you keep going with this
rhythm?
Step 5: Keep swimming with a rhythmic breathing pattern. Never break the rhythm
by holding your breath.

LEvERAGE DRILLS
Leverage is a major part of swimming well. It works with all aspects of the stroke
including floatation, kicking, arm stroke, recovery, breathing and coordination.
Many of the drills you have already practiced throughout the Freestyle section of
this book have made use of leverage. It is important to practice making use of lever-
age in the water, because it is not quite as easy as it is on land. In swimming, the
swimmer must create his or her own stability to create leverage from, unlike on land
where the ground itself provides stability. Use the following drills to improve your
leverage in freestyle.

. LEAN IN, LEAN OUT
The purpose of this drill
• Using leverage with the arm stroke
• Powering the arm stroke with your core
• Feeling a longer, stronger arm stroke
How to do this drill
Step 1: Begin swimming freestyle. As your left arm enters the water and extends
into the catch, feel your left hip and shoulder lean left into the stroke while your
left arm descends into the water.
Step 2: As your left arm prepares to do the upsweep, your left hip and shoulder
begin to lean to the right and are fully leaning right while the left arm finishes the
underwater stroke.
Step 3: Now focus on both of your arms. As your left arm enters the water and
extends into the catch, and your left hip and shoulder are leaning into the stroke,
what is happening with
your right arm? Notice
that while all this is hap-
pening on your left side,
your right arm in transi-
tioning to the finish of the
stroke, and your right
shoulder and hip are lean-
ing out of the stroke.

The purpose of this drill
• Feeling the importance of leverage
• Realizing the limitations of flat freestyle
• Using leverage throughout the stroke
How to do this drill
Step 1: From a standing position, hold a tennis ball in one of your hands. Without
moving your body at all, throw the ball forward overhand. Notice where it lands.
Step 2: Prepare to throw the ball again. This time as your arm moves back overhead,
allow your same side shoulder and hip to move back with it. Throw the ball. Notice
that it sails much farther through the air than your first throw.
Step 3: Do a similar exercise in the
water. Swim freestyle. As you perform
the arm stroke and flutter kick, keep your
body exactly flat. Imagine you are float-

. MAINTAIN THE CENTERLINE
The purpose of this drill
• Holding your alignment
• Maintaining a stable axis
• Using your fulcrum
How to do this drill
Step 1: Stick a long piece of masking tape in the middle of a full-length mirror from
the floor to about your height. Now stick another piece of masking tape vertically
down the center of your body, starting at your chin. This is your centerline, and you
want it to remain straight at all times. Your centerline works as both your axis for
alignment, and your fulcrum to make leverage possible.
Step 2: Stand in front of the taped mirror. Line up the tape on the mirror with the
tape on your centerline. With your arms at your sides, start swinging your hips and
shoulders forward and backward, about the same amount that you do when you
lean in and out of your stroke. Use the same rate as your stroke rate. Check to see
if the tape on the mirror and the tape marking your centerline stay lined up. If so,
you are maintaining alignment.
Step 3: Now simulate your freestyle stroke as you stand in front of the mirror. Make
sure to include the arm entry, extension and catch, down and upsweep, and the fast
finish. Make sure to include the roll that produces leverage for each stroke. Repeat
for several stroke cycles. Check to see if the tape on the mirror and the tape marking
your centerline stay lined up. If so, you are staying on your axis.

the pool as you did the tape on the mirror. Swim free-

and fast finish. Roll in and roll out to gain leverage.
Check to see if your centerline is lined up with the line

ing leverage for you? Repeat.

. THE KICK LEvER
The purpose of this drill
• Connecting the kick and the arm stroke
• Finding leverage between the arms and the legs
• Timing the kick to the arm stroke
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim freestyle using a 2-beat kick—that is one kick with each arm stroke
during a complete stroke cycle. Time the downbeat of your kick so it happens as you
make your catch with the opposite side hand. Practice until you are able to maintain
this timing easily. Notice that the power from downbeat of the kick travels up and
across your body improving the quality of your catch. Try it again. As you kick down,
feel the water in your hand.
Step 2: Now swim freestyle with a 4-beat kick—that is two kicks with each arm
stroke during a complete stroke cycle. Time the downbeat of the first kick so it hap-
pens as you make your catch with the opposite side hand. Time the downbeat of
the second kick so it happens as you transition to the finish phase of the same side
arm stroke. Practice until you are able to maintain this complicated timing easily.
Feel the first kick assist your catch. Feel the second kick help you achieve a fast fin-
ish of your arm stroke.
Step 3: Now swim freestyle with a
6-beat kick—that is three kicks with each
arm stroke during a complete stroke
cycle. Time the downbeat of the first
kick so it happens as you make your

I can’t get the timing. It is complicated, especially at the 4-beat kick stage. Try
focusing on only the kick/catch lever in your stroke at
first. Practice this for a long time, then add in the kick/
finish lever. When you proceed to the 6-beat stage, it is
actually easier to match the kicks to these points in
your arm stroke, because there are more available kicks.

COORDINATION DRILLS
Developing a great freestyle requires becoming skilled at numerous elements of the
stroke. However without the ability to coordinate these many individual parts into
one seamless effort, great freestyle will remain elusive. It is useful to look at each
individual part of the stroke as having multiple purposes, like links in a chain, they
connect not to one other link, but to two. Coordinating freestyle is a matter of
sequencing and timing the many parts of the stroke so they benefit each other, and the
stroke as a whole. Use the following drills to improve your coordination in freestyle.

. REACH AND RECOvER
The purpose of this drill
• Feeling the relationship between the extension and the recovery
• Powering two different actions at the same time
• Feeling power from the core
How to do this drill
Step 1: Standing in chest deep water, bend forward at the waist and perform the
freestyle arm stroke, including breathing.
Step 2: After several strokes, freeze when your left arm is at full extension in front.
Notice that your body is leaning into that extension, so that the left shoulder lower
than the right, providing leverage to the beginning of the arm stroke. At the same
time, the right arm should be in mid recovery. Notice that the right side of the body
is leaning out, so that the right shoulder is higher than the left, allowing the recov-
ering arm to clear the water.

. SWIMMING TALL
The purpose of this drill
• Maintaining length of stroke
• Having a reaching arm at all times
• Eliminating drag
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim several laps of freestyle at a comfortable pace. Focus on utilizing
available leverage by rolling into and out of your stroke. Focus on connecting the
movements on either side of your body. Focus on driving your stroke from the core.
Step 2: With each stroke make the most of the extension in front. Coordinate your
stroke so that at the point when one arm is extending, the other is recovering.
Observe that at this point in the stroke neither arm is actively engaged in producing
forward motion. Notice that despite this fact, your body is still moving forward.
Step 3: Continue to swim freestyle, focusing on that point when one arm is extend-
ing and the other is out of the water recovering. How is it that the body continues
to move forward without any effort from your upper body? This is the most stream-
lined position of the freestyle stroke. It produces the least drag and makes the most
of the momentum of the previous stroke. This is your tall position, and it is your
secret weapon.
Step 4: Continue to swim freestyle.

Drills for backstroke
BODY POSITION DRILLS
Good body position in backstroke is often misunderstood. From the time we were in
swim lessons as young children many of us heard, “Push your tummy up!” And when
we did that, sure enough, our face went into the water upside down leaving us with
such a memorable experience of water filled sinuses that we decided that back-
stroke was an awful stroke, and we have avoided it as much as possible ever since.
So, let’s take time to relearn the basic backstroke float, to ensure it is comfortable
and stable and maybe even something we might enjoy! Use the following drills to
improve your body position in backstroke.

. SPINE LINE
The purpose of this drill
• Floating comfortably on your back
• Floating well on your back
• Using core tension to achieve a good backstroke position
How to do this drill
Step 1: Lay face up on the pool deck. Relax your neck and shoulders. Press your
spine into the ground from the back of your neck, between your shoulder blades,
and even at the small of your back. Make your whole spine come in contact with
the pool deck.
Step 2: Notice that this is easier to achieve with some parts of your spine, including
between your shoulder blades. For other parts it is quite a challenge. To get the back
of your neck to touch the pool deck you will have to pull your chin inward toward
the back of your throat. To get the small of your back to touch the pool deck you
will have to rotate your pelvis forward and contract your abdominal muscles. Hold
this position in order to commit it to memory so you will be able to recreate it when
you get in the water.
Step 3: Get in chest-deep water. With your arms extended to the sides from your
shoulders, prepare to recreate the position you were in on your back on the pool
deck. First, lower your shoulders into the water and lean back until your head is in
the water, and the water is covering your ears. Next, allow your neck, shoulders and chest
to relax as they follow your head into a horizontal position at the surface of the water.
Step 4: Now, rotate your pelvis forward, as you did on the pool deck. Engage your
abdominal muscles in this action, and contract them as you gently push away from

The purpose of this drill
• Developing good head position
• Achieving a relaxed neck and upper body
• Associating backstroke with comfort
How to do this drill
Step 1: Lay down on your back with your head on your favorite pillow. Feel your
head sink gently into the softness. Feel your neck and shoulders relax. Feel that no
muscles are engaged because your head is supported by your wonderful pillow.
Step 2: Keeping your pillow in mind, get into chest deep water. Lower your shoul-
ders into the water. Gently lay the back of your head back so the water surrounds
your face at the hairline. Allow your neck, shoulders and chest to follow. Relax your
arms as they float extended out from your shoulders. Rotate your pelvis forward and
engage your abdominal muscles. Give a gentle push off the bottom of the pool with
your feet and float on your spine.
Step 3: Focus on your head as it floats comfortably in the water, as if it is being
supported by your favorite pillow. Repeat several times until you achieve a fully
relaxed head and neck while floating on your back.

KICK DRILLS
Good backstroke kickers find it a comfortable and efficient way to move through
the water. These swimmers have discovered that the secret to a great backstroke
kick is in the ankle. There is less range of motion by the leg in the back flutter kick
than in front flutter kick, as the back flutter kick is performed almost exclusively
below the bodyline. However the feet flex and rotate more in backstroke kick. In
addition good backstroke kickers use as little abduction at the knee as possible to
avoid producing drag. Use the following drills to improve your kicking technique for
backstroke.

. KICK UP!
The purpose of this drill
• Learning to kick productively on the back
• Feeling the power phase of the backstroke kick
• Developing foot speed
How to do this drill
Step 1: In the water, float on your back with your arms at your sides. Float on your
spine in the banana position. Begin kicking using an alternating leg motion as in
freestyle, but on your back.
Step 2: Begin by dropping your heel down gently into the water about twelve to
fifteen inches below the surface. Then push the water up sharply using the top of
your foot.
Step 3: Done correctly this kick will produce a reaction that resembles boiling water
on this surface of the water. Try it again. Allow your heel to drop down below the
surface of the water then kick upward with a quick short burst of force. As one foot
kicks up, the other drops down.
Step 4: Keep practicing until you can produce good forward motion and a consis-
tent boil at the surface around your feet.

. NO KNEES/NO TOES
The purpose of this drill
• Eliminating potential drag
• Achieving a streamlined kick
• Feeling a productive backstroke kick
How to do this drill
Step 1: Stand facing a wall, close enough that your toes touch the wall. Balance on
your right foot. Draw your left leg back so your foot ends up about twelve to fifteen
inches behind you.
Step 2: With your toes pointed, quickly sweep your foot forward so it stops exactly
at the starting position. Try it again. Control the movement so neither your foot, nor
your knee comes in contact with the wall in front of you. Try it several more times.
Step 3: Switch legs. Balancing on your left leg, draw your right leg back behind you
so your foot moves about twelve to fifteen inches back. Point your toes and use a
short, sharp kick forward to bring your foot back to the starting point. Do not pass the
starting point. Avoid hitting the wall with your foot or your knee. Repeat several times.
Step 4: Try it in the water. Float on your back with your arms at your sides. Allow
your left heel to drop down into the water about twelve to fifteen inches. With your
toes pointed, move your foot quickly back to the starting point, put not past it.
There should be no sign of your knee or your toes breaking the surface of the water.
Try it several times with your left foot, then switch to your right foot.
Step 5: Now, floating on your back with your arms at your sides, try kicking regular
back flutter kick using the technique you have just practiced. Your kick is limited to

. GOOD KNEE, BAD KNEE
The purpose of this drill
• Understanding two kinds of knee bend
• Avoiding abduction at the hip
• Feeling the right kind of knee bend
How to do this drill
Step 1: In shallow water, stand with your back against the side of the pool. Hold
on to the side of the pool with your arms extended for stability. Raise your left leg
up to 90 degrees, so it is extended in front of you at the surface of the water.
Step 2: Bring your knee closer to your chest by folding slightly inward at the hip. Is
your knee bent? This is the kind of knee bend we want to avoid in backstroke. Notice
that the knee breaks the surface of the water, and would be a source of drag. Notice
that while you’re with your knee bent this way, your whole leg is not positioned to
kick, so you would lose power from the kick. Remember this as a bad knee bend.
Step 3: Return your leg to the starting position extended in front of you at the
surface of the water, 90 degrees to your body. Now, drop your heal to about fifteen
inches under the surface of water. Is your knee bent? This is the helpful kind of knee
bend for backstroke. Notice that your knee does not break the surface of the water.
Notice that with your knee bent this way that your foot is positioned well to push
the water upward with force. Remember this as a good knee bend.
Step 4: Now, with your arms extended over your head in a streamline position,
perform the backstroke kick. First, try a half lap with the bad knee bend. Notice that
forward motion is hard to achieve. Now, kick the rest of the way with the good knee
bend. Feel yourself excel with an effective backstroke kick.

ARM STROKE DRILLS
It is hard not to think of the backstroke arm stroke as following a completely circular
path. After all, when we watch backstroke that is what we see happening on top of
the water. But in fact what happens underwater is completely different. The hands
sweep down and up in an exaggerated pull/push pattern that resembles an exag-
gerated Z. In many ways the backstroke arm stroke is similar to freestyle except in
backstroke the whole underwater path is at the side of the body rather than under
it. Use the following drills to improve your arm stroke technique for backstroke.

The purpose of this drill
• Learning the path of the backstroke arm stroke
• Feeling the deep and shallow sweep of the backstroke arms
• Maintaining a high elbow position

left arm extended above your head. Feel your body lean toward with left. Begin
kicking. Use your right arm only to swim the backstroke.
Step 2: Allow your left hand to travel below the surface of the water about 15
inches. Then, holding your elbow in a stable, high position, sweep your hand up and
past your shoulder following a semi-circular path to your hip. Repeat several times,
then switch arms.
Step 3: Do it again. Feel

. DESCEND TO CATCH
The purpose of this drill
• Finding the backstroke catch
• Feeling the backstroke catch
• Learning to catch deep
How to do this drill
Step 1: Float on your back in the water with your right arm at your side and your
left arm extended above your head. Begin kicking. Use your right arm only to swim
the backstroke.
Step 2: Descend your left arm about fifteen inches into the water, using your pinkie
to cut the water and lead your hand downward. Feel your left shoulder and hip also
descend. Feel your right shoulder and hip rise.
Step 3: When your hand reaches its deepest point, rotate your palm outward and
make your catch. As you start to sweep your hand up and past your shoulder in a
semi-circular motion, feel the pressure of the water against your hand and forearm.
Repeat several times. Try it with your right arm moving.
Step 4: Now swim backstroke with two arms. Find your catch on each side.

. SHORT PULL, LONG PUSH
The purpose of this drill
• Feeling both pull and push motions
• Making the transition from pull to push
• Holding on to the water
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim backstroke. Descend to your hand into the water. At its deepest point
rotate your palm out and grab a hand full of water. Sweep your hand up and over
your shoulder and down past your hip. Practice for several laps. Notice the point in
your stroke when your hand, elbow and shoulder all line up.
Step 2: Continue swimming backstroke. After the catch of each stroke, use your
hand and forearm to pull the water up into the semi-circular sweep past your shoul-
der, keeping your elbow high and stable. Notice that it is at the top of this semi-
circle that your hand, elbow and shoulder all line up.
Step 3: Continue swimming backstroke. Descend, catch and pull to the point that
your hand, elbow and shoulder line up. Then, push the water through the end of the
semi-circle past your shoulder and toward your hips. Notice the transition from pull
to push.
Step 4: Practice again say-
ing to yourself, “Descend,
catch, pull, push.” Notice
that in backstroke the pull
is quite short, whereas the
push is very long. Figure 36: Pull up to the shoulder, Push past the hip.

RECOvERY DRILLS
The recovery in backstroke makes a perfect arch over the shoulder, starting from the
point when the arm is straight along the side of the body and ending at the point
when the arm is extended over-head. During this arch the muscles of the arm should
be very loose and relaxed, and the elbow should be locked. Done well, the back-
stroke recovery can provide four things: rest for the recovering arm, balance to the
underwater arm, momentum for the next stroke, and last but not least, important
alignment in a stroke where you cannot see where you are going! Use the following
drills to improve your recovery technique for backstroke.

. RELEASE TO RECOvER
The purpose of this drill
• Making a clean transition to the recovery
• Avoiding drag when the hand leaves the water
• Learning to let go of the water
How to do this drill
Step 1: Stand in chest deep water with your arms at your sides. Position your hands
so the backs of your hands face the front. Without bending your elbows, quickly
raise your hands out of the water. Notice that the water feels heavy against the
backs of your hands. Notice that you carry a lot of water up as your hands leave
the water.
Step 2: Now, with your arms at your sides, position your hands so the palms of your
hands face the front. Without bending your elbows, quickly raise your hands out of
the water. Notice that the water feels heavy against your palms. Notice that you
carry a lot of water up as your hands leave the water. Try it again.
Step 3: Next, with your arms at your sides, position your hands so the palms of your
hands face the outsides of your legs. Without bending your elbows, quickly raise
your hands out of the water. Notice that your hands slide easily out of the water.
Notice that you carry much less water up as your hands leave the water. Try it again.
Step 4: Finally, with your arms at your sides, position your hands so the backs of
your hands face the outsides of your legs–pinkies forward. Without bending your
elbows, quickly raise your hands out of the water. Notice that your hands slide easily
out of the water. Notice that you carry much less water up as your hands leave the
water. Try it again.

. NON-STOP RECOvERY
The purpose of this drill
• Utilizing recovery momentum
• Creating a counter balance to the underwater arm
• Maintaining stroke rhythm
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim backstroke for several laps. Focus on making a deep catch, then throw-
ing the water up and past your shoulder in an accelerating pull/push motion. Feel
your hand release the water then recover in a relaxed arch back to the start. Feel
the rhythm and balance of the stroke. Notice that your arms work in opposition, that
is when one is in mid recovery, the other is in mid stroke underwater—at the transi-
tion from pull to push.
Step 2: Now, after several rhythmic stroke cycles, stop your recovering arm at the
top of the arch, when it is pointing up to the sky. Notice that when you do this it is
difficult to keep accelerating the underwater arm. Try it again, several times. Notice
that even though your recovering arm is not in the water moving your forward, that
an interruption in the line and flow of the recovery affects your forward motion.
Step 3: Swim backstroke again. Focus
on the top of the arch of your recovery.

My arms are not opposite. It is very important to establish opposition in the arm
stroke. Focus on the home base position of one arm
up and the other down, when one arm is entering the
water at the same time that the other is exiting the

. ELEvEN O’CLOCK AND ONE O’CLOCK
The purpose of this drill
• Feeling good alignment
• Avoiding under and over-reaching
• Alleviating shoulder stress
How to do this drill
Step 1: Stand in front of a full-length mirror. Raise your left arm up as you would
in the backstroke recovery until it is fully extended over your head. Notice how your
hand aligns. If your arm were the hour hand on a clock, what time would it be? If
your hand is pointing to twelve o’clock, you are over-reaching. If your hand is poin-
ting to ten o’clock, you are under-reaching. If your hand is pointing to eleven
o’clock, it is aligned with your shoulder, as it should be for backstroke.
Step 2: In order for the shoulder to rotate freely through the joint throughout the
stroke, it must be aligned correctly in recovery. A poorly aligned backstroke recovery
leads you to swim the whole stroke flat to avoid shoulder pain that occurs when the
shoulder is forced to rotate in ways it was not intended to rotate, including perfor-
ming a deep catch. Try it again. Raise your left arm up to eleven o’clock. Repeat
several times. Try it with your right arm. Reach to one o’clock. Repeat several times.
Step 3: Now, standing in front of the
mirror, arms at your sides, close your
eyes. Raise your left arm, simulating the
backstroke recovery. Try to finish the
recovery at exactly eleven o’clock. Open
your eyes and check your placement. Try

. FIRM ELBOW, LOOSE WRIST
The purpose of this drill
• Achieving an aligned recovery
• Achieving rest for the recovering arm
• Developing a productive recovery
How to do this drill
Step 1: Get in the water and float on your back with your arms at your sides. Create
forward movement by kicking productively.
Step 2: Raise your right arm, as you would in the backstroke recovery to the highest
point in the recovery arch, so your hand is pointing to the sky. Let your body float
with your right side higher than your left. Lock your elbow using your bones, not
your muscles. Check that it is locked by gently shaking your arm from the shoulder
for several seconds. Your arm should be straight from shoulder to wrist.
Step 3: Still kicking productively, with your right arm
high, and your elbow locked, let your right hand go
limp from the wrist. Check to see if your hand and wrist
are relaxed by gently shaking your arm from the shoul-
der for several seconds. It should naturally flop to the
outside, with your palm down. Switch arms and repeat.
Step 4: Now try swimming backstroke. Focus on main-
taining a firm elbow and loose wrist throughout the

BREATHING DRILLS
When swimmers were asked about their favorite part of backstroke, the most com-
mon answer revolved around breathing not being issue because the face is out of
the water. But, in fact, in backstroke breathing is an issue. It is an issue of rhythm
and especially of energy management. Just as in all other strokes, and other sports,
rhythmic breathing is essential in fueling the body to perform. Although it is tempt-
ing, the swimmer should never hold his or her breath in backstroke, but instead
develop a breathing pattern of inhaling and exhaling. Good breathing technique
makes a huge difference in backstroke. Use the following drills to improve your
breathing technique for backstroke.

. NOSE BREATHING/MOUTH BREATHING
The purpose of this drill
• Understanding breathing issues in backstroke
• Learning to keep water out of the nose and mouth
• Experiencing rhythmic breathing in the water
How to do this drill
Step 1: In chest deep water, take a big breath and lower yourself under the water
until your nose is submerged, but your eyes are still out of the water. Expel air
through your nose, but not your mouth in a long, continuous stream. Notice a
steady stream of bubbles emerge from your nostrils. Stand and inhale through your
mouth only. Submerge again, expelling air through your nose.
Step 2: Repeat ten times using your normal breathing rhythm. Submerge and
exhale through your nose. Stand and inhale through your mouth. Notice that no
water goes into your nose as long as bubbles are coming out. Repeat again, this
time expelling air through your nose and mouth, and inhaling only through your
mouth only. Be rhythmic.
Step 3: Now, get into a back float position. Take a big breath and allow yourself to
slowly submerge. An instant before your nose goes underwater, begin actively expel-
ling air through it. Notice the stream of bubbles coming from your nose. Notice that
even in a head back position no water goes into your nose as long as bubbles are
coming out.
Step 4: Now begin swimming backstroke. Focus on establishing a breathing rhythm.
Inhale as one arm recovers, and exhale as the other recovers. Inhale through your
mouth only. Exhale through your nose and mouth. Be sensitive to the rhythm of the

. FUEL YOUR STROKE
The purpose of this drill
• Understanding fueling the body in backstroke
• Learning to inhale deep
• Learning to exhale long
How to do this drill
Step 1: In streamline position, kick backstroke across the pool rapidly. Use a fast
kick rhythm. Kick strongly. Notice you are out of breath when you get to the other
side of the pool. Backstroke is the only stroke where the power phase of the kick is
against gravity. A great deal of oxygen is needed to sustain the kick. Kick another
lap, actively and rhythmically inhaling new air and exhaling old air.

LEvERAGE DRILLS
A good backstroke depends on leverage. Without it, more speed can only be
achieved through a faster stroke rate and kick, and this is limiting factor. The main
source of leverage in backstroke is the body roll. Powered by the swimmer’s core, the
body roll not only provides more potential power and speed to the arm stroke, but
it also increases the swimmer’s range of motion. By using leverage from the core in
backstroke, fewer strokes are necessary, more distance per stroke can be realized,
and less energy is expended. Use the following drills to improve your leverage in
backstroke.

The purpose of this drill
• Learning to initiate the roll from the hip
• Feeling the center of power for the backstroke
• Developing rhythmic hip rotation
How to do this drill
Step 1: Float on your back with your arms at your sides. Use a gentle but continuous
kick to produce forward motion. Using your hips only, rotate your body to the right
about 45 degrees and hold for the count of six. Using your hips only, rotate your
body to the left about 45 degrees and hold for the count of six. Continue for
several laps.
Step 2: Now float on your back with your left arm at your side and your right arm
extended above your head. Using your hips only, rotate your body about 45 degrees
towards the extended arm and hold for the count of six. Using your hips only, rotate
your body to the right about 45 degrees as you move your extended arm through
the path of the stroke to your side, and move the arm at your side along the back-
stroke recovery path to the extended position. Hold for the count of six. Rotate
again to the left as your switch arm positions. Continue for several laps. Feel your
body balance shift.

. THE PERFECT ANGLE
The purpose of this drill
• Utilizing core leverage
• Producing leverage in the mid-pull
• Feeling a stable elbow
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim backstroke. As your body rotates in and out of the stroke focus on the
leverage produced from your core. Notice how it positively affects every phase of
your stroke. It sends your hand into the catch with force. It assists your arm stoking
up and past your shoulder. It helps you finish fast. It drives your arm into the recov-
ery with speed. As you are swimming, notice each of these points of leverage from
the core working in your stroke.
Step 2: Continuing to swim backstroke, focus on the point in your stroke when your
arm is in mid-pull underwater. This is the point when your elbow reaches a maxi-
mum bend, as it transitions from a pulling motion to a pushing motion. It is also
the point when your body is rotated down towards your stroking side. Feel the rota-
tion in your body. Feel the angle of your arm bent at the elbow.
Step 3: Continue swimming backstroke.
Focus on keeping your elbow high and
stable at the mid point in the stroke. At
this point, when the elbow is at its maxi-
mum angle, and if it is aligned correctly
with the shoulder and hand, a perfectly

COORDINATION DRILLS
When all the elements of backstroke work together, they create a smooth, rhythmic
stroke that carries the swimmer gracefully through the pool with seemingly little
effort. Good backstroke coordination is more that simply doing things in the right
sequence. It requires the swimmer to use the opposition inherent in the stroke to
balance the actions of both sides of the body so they work interdependently
throughout the stroke. Use the following drills to improve your coordination in
backstroke.

. HOME BASE CHECKPOINT
The purpose of this drill
• Checking coordination
• Maintaining opposition
• Swimming tall
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim backstroke at a relaxed rate. Focus on the opposition in your stroke.
Start from the point when one arm is extended over your head, and the other is at
your side—exactly opposite of the other arm, when you are at your tallest, do your
arms remain opposite throughout the rest of the stroke cycle? Practice for several laps.
Step 2: Swim backstroke at a faster rate focusing on the
opposition in your stroke. Use your tall position—that is
the point when one arm is extended over your head, and
the other is at your side—exactly opposite of the other
arm as your home base position. Every sixth stroke, check
to see if you are maintaining opposition in your stroke at
this home base position.
Step 3: Sprint backstroke. Focus on the opposition in
your stroke. Are you able to hit the home base position
each stroke? Are you swimming tall? Practice Steps 1 - 3
several times.

The purpose of this drill
• Feeling cross-stroke balance
• Establishing stroke stability
• Kicking up at the catch
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim backstroke emphasizing rotation from the hips. Establish rhythm from
the hips. Create leverage from the hips. Drive your arm stroke from the hips. And
feel that your kick is assisted by your hip rotation. Your hips are central to all other
stroke actions.
Step 2: Continue swimming backstroke. Notice that when your hips are rotated left
to the maximum, your left arm is driving deep to the catch. At the same time, your
right foot should be kicking up, creating a cross-stroke
line. Feel your kick assist your catch.
Step 3: Continue swimming backstroke. Notice that
when your hips are rotated right to the maximum, that
your right arm is driving deep to the catch. At the same
time, your left foot should be kicking up, creating a

. BACKSTROKE SILHOUETTE
The purpose of this drill
• Feeling your space in the water
• Maintaining full alignment
• Balancing efficiency and drag
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim backstroke focusing on the your spine line. Feel your feet align with
your head. Feel the space that you take up in the water. This is your backstroke
silhouette. Where is it widest? Where is it narrowest? Is it streamlined? Is there a
purpose for the wide part? Is there a way to make the widest point in your stroke
narrower to reduce drag without reducing your efficiency?
Step 2: Imagine you had no elbows, and you could only use a straight-arm stroke.
Knowing that the completely circular backstroke path, both over and under the
water is inefficient and hard on the shoulders, choose the path to the side of your
body. Try it, perform the backstroke with straight arms, stroking to the sides of your
body, as if you were making a snow angel. Notice that your feet sway toward your
underwater arm with every straight-arm stroke. Feel the drag that is created by your
feet fishtailing. Feel that the space you
take up in the water is much larger. Try
it again.
Step 3: Return to backstroke with elbows
and regain your narrower arm stroke.

Drills for breaststroke
BODY POSITION DRILLS
Unlike the freestyle and backstroke that use latitudinal rotation for leverage and
power, the breaststroke depends on a longitudinal motion. This means that the
floating position of breaststroke is not simply oriented forward, it alternates
between a downward leaning position and an upward leaning position.
This stroke feature can enhance the productivity of the breaststroke dramati-
cally if done correctly. It can also produce significant drag in a stroke that already
has several potential points of drag, therefore achieving good body position in
breaststroke is a major priority. Use the following drills to improve your body posi-
tion in breaststroke.

. TWO BALANCE POINTS
The purpose of this drill
• Understanding breaststroke body position
• Feeling the downward balance point
• xFeeling the upward balance point
How to do this drill
Step 1: Take a big breath and float face down in the water with your arms at your
sides. Look at the bottom of the pool, not forward. Press your chest down in the
water so you hips feel light and float higher than your chest. This is the downward
balance point for breaststroke.
Step 2: Again, take a big breath and float face down with your arms at your sides.
Look at the bottom of the pool, not forward. Holding your hips stable, raise your
chest above your hips. This is the upward balance point for breaststroke.
Step 3: Again, take a big breath, float face down, arms at your sides and look at
the bottom of the pool. Achieve the downward balance point and hold for the count
of three. Then, achieve the upward balance point and hold for the count of three.
Notice that it is more dif-
ficult to hold the upward
balance point for the
count of three. Try it
again. Press your chest
down and find the down-
ward balance point, then
raise your chest to find
the upward balance point. Figure 51: The two balance points of breastroke

. LONG FLOAT
The purpose of this drill
• Floating long and narrow
• Eliminating drag
• Feeling breaststroke’s glide position
How to do this drill
Step 1: Get in the pool and prepare to push off the wall for breaststroke. As you
submerge under the water with your feet on the wall, extend your arms over your
head and look down at the bottom of the pool. Stretch your arms until your elbows
are straight. Squeeze your ears between your arms. Position your hands side by side
so they form a point. Notice that this is similar to the streamline position for free-
style (Drill 3) except that the hands are positioned side by side for breaststroke,
rather than clasped one over the over as in freestyle.
Step 2: Holding your arms tight in this position, push off the side of the pool into
a front floating position. Look down at the bottom of the pool. Point your toes and
stretch. Feel yourself cut through the water without resistance. Feel yourself float

Step 2: Just before your momentum slows, simultaneously, raise your chest and
draw your hands from the extended position toward your body and cross them over
your chest. Notice that this action produces a bit of lift for your upper body, raising
it toward the upward balance point. Try it again with more speed. Shift from the
downward to the upward balance point by raising your upper body as you do a
quick sweep of your hands to your chest.
Step 3: Notice that without changing your head position, your face rises through
the surface of the water. This is your short float position, and the breathing position
for breaststroke. Notice that you cannot easily sustain this position. Feel your face
sink back into the water. Feel your feet sink. Try it again.

KICK DRILLS
The breaststroke kick stands alone among the other strokes in many ways. It is the
only kick that generates its main power from the soles of the feet. It is the only kick
that follows a circular kicking pattern. And, it is the only kick where the kick pro-
duces more power for forward motion than the arm stroke. The unique aspects of
the breaststroke kick make it an especially interesting stroke for the technique-
minded swimmer, and fun for the rest of us. Use the following drills to improve your
kicking technique for breaststroke.

. FOOT AWARENESS
The purpose of this drill
• Learning breaststroke foot positions
• Practicing ankle rotation
• Feeling foot speed
How to do this drill
Step 1: Sit in a straight-back chair. Raise your feet off the ground until there is no
bend in your knees and your legs are extended in front of you. Focus on your feet
and ankles. Your feet serve as your pushing surfaces in the breaststroke kick, and
your ankles work to position your feet so they can perform the kick. Rotate your feet
in a circle and feel the range of motion that is possible from your feet.
Step 2: Next, practice the basic foot position for the power phase of the breaststroke
kick. Flex your feet by raising your toes toward you and turning your feet out to the
sides. The entire soles of your feet should be available to push water around and
back in a whip-like motion.
Step 3: Now, practice the foot position for the early part of the power phase of the
breaststroke kick. From the flexed position, rotate your feet so that the inner surface,
along the arch of your foot is available to push water out and around. This will be
your leading edge during this part of the kick.
Step 4: Now, practice the
foot position for the late
part of the power phase
of the breaststroke kick.

From the flexed position, rotate your feet so that the outer edge of your foot is avail-
able to push water in and around. This will be your leading edge during this part
of the kick.
Step 5: Next, practice the foot position for the glide phase of the breaststroke kick.
Point your toes attempting to make a straight line from your knee to your toes.
Allow your feet to turn inward if it is comfortable in order to make the most stream-
line shape possible.
Step 6: Now, try the complete foot rotation cycle. Flex your feet to prepare for the
power phase. First position your flexed feet to push out and back by leading with
the inner surface of your feet. Then position your flexed feet to push in and back by
leading with the outer surface of your feet. Finally, point your toes as you would to
complete the cycle in the glide position.

. AROUND THE KNEES
The purpose of this drill
• Feeling the path of the breaststroke kick
• Maintaining a hold on the water
• Achieving foot speed
How to do this drill
Step 1: Sit in a straight-back chair. Hold on to the sides of the chair for support.
Raise your feet off the ground until there is no bend in your knees and your legs are
extended in front of you. Prepare to trace the path of the breaststroke kick. Focus
on your legs and your feet as they move through the phases of the kick in a mirror
image of each other.
Step 2: From the extended leg position, begin with your toes pointed, as your would
hold them in the streamline position. Now, draw your feet back as far as possible
on either side of the chair. As your feet move back, curl your toes up and turn your
feet outward to prepare for the power phase of the kick. Your legs should now be
bent at the knee as far as possible, more than 90 degrees.
Step 3: Now, leading with the outside blades of your feet, press your feet outward
and away from your body, holding your knees in a stable position. Then, when your
feet are just wider than your shoulders, still holding your knees stable, rotate your
feet so the inside blades lead and whip them inward and away from your body
quickly until your legs are straight. At the very end of this rounded movement, point
your toes again.

straight. Do you move forward during
this phase of the kick?
Step 4: Try it again. Draw your heel

the recovery, your feet should not push water. They should gently slide through the
water so they create as little drag as possible.
Step 5: The recovery ends when your feet reach their highest point behind you and
are turned to the outside as much as possible. The power phase begins when you
push the water back and around with the soles of your feet. During the power phase
your feet should engage the water and hold on to it as they whip around until your
legs are straight, moving you forward the whole time.
Step 6: Continue kicking breaststroke kick focusing on achieving a gentle recovery
that does not create drag, then an active power phase that vaults you forward in

. STRAIGHT HIP LINE
The purpose of this drill
• Using a stable hip position
• Avoiding bending at the hips
• Eliminating Drag
How to do this drill
Step 1: Stand on the pool deck. Balance on your left foot. Raise you right foot off
the ground without bending at the hip. How will you accomplish this? If you lift
your knee in order to get your foot off the ground you will be bent at the hips. If
you lift your foot straight up you will also be bent at the hips. Try lifting the heel of
your foot behind you. Notice you have raised your foot without bending at the hips.
Notice the straight line from your shoulder to your knee. Try it again.
Step 2: Achieving a breaststroke kick without bending at the hips is very important
in avoiding a major potential point of drag in the stroke. Try it in the water. Float
vertically in water deeper than you are tall. Place your hands across your chest and
begin kicking breaststroke kick.
Step 3: Notice that if you begin the kick by raising your knees toward your chest,
you sink immediately. Instead, raise your heels behind you toward your buttocks,
creating a straight line from your shoulders to your knees. Notice that you don’t
sink.
Step 4: Continue kicking breaststroke kick in the vertical position. Keep your face
from submerging by maintaining a straight line from shoulder to knee when you
draw your heels back behind you.

The purpose of this drill
• Feeling stable knees
• Keeping the knees inside the feet
• Kicking around the knees
How to do this drill
Step 1: Using a kickboard, float on your front and kick breaststroke kick across the
pool. Hold the board so it supports your arms and allows you to float comfortably
with your head up. Before you move your legs from the extended position, notice
how your knees are aligned. They should be lined up with your hips, and they should
stay in this position through the entire kick.
Step 2: Begin the kick by performing the recovery. Draw your feet back and to the
outside of your legs then flex your feet preparing for the power phase. As you draw
your feet back, check your knee position. Are your knees wider than your feet? If
they are, stop and start over.

ARM STROKE DRILLS
Breaststroke arm stroke is unlike the arm stroke of any other stroke in terms of both
path and purpose. Breaststroke arm stroke is relatively short compared to the other
strokes, and it follows largely a lateral path. In terms of efficiency, breaststroke arm
stroke produces the least forward motion of any stroke, and in fact it is the only
stroke in which the kick produces more power than the arms. What the breaststroke
arm stroke does do very well though is provide lift for the breathing, leverage for
the kick, and rhythm for the stroke. Use the following drills to improve your arm
stroke technique for breaststroke.

. SWEEP OUT, SWEEP IN
The purpose of this drill
• Learning the path of the breaststroke arms
• Using hand pitch
• Achieving lift
How to do this drill
Step 1: Stand in waist-deep water. Bend forward at the hips so your chest and
shoulders are in the water and your chin is on the surface of the water so you can
observe your arms and hands throughout this drill. Extend your arms in front of you.
Stretch from the elbows and position your hands in a point.
Step 2: Prepare to trace the path of the breaststroke arm stroke. With both arms
moving in a mirror image of each other, pitch your hands slightly outward, thumbs
down. Then, sweep your hands straight out just wider than your shoulders, remain-
ing a few inches under the surface of the water.
Step 3: Now, flip your hands over so they are in a thumbs-up position, and sweep
your hands inward and back towards your chest in a swift motion along a slightly
deeper path in the water. Your hands should meet in the middle, palms together
with your fingers pointing forward.
Return your arms to the extended posi-
tion and try it again.
Step 4: From the starting point with
your arms extended, sweep your hands

The purpose of this drill
• Holding on to the water as your hands change directions
• Changing the pitch of your hand
• Feeling lift
How to do this drill
Step 1: Float face down in the water with your arms extended, hands forming a

breaststroke arm stroke. Start by pitching your hands slightly palms-out and sweep
the water to a point just wider than your shoulders. Then change the pitch of your
hands to a palms-in position and sweep the water in and back towards your chest.
Step 2: Return to the extended position and try it again. Feel the water in your
hands as you sweep out to the widest point. Hold on to the same water as your
hands change directions in a tight turn, accelerating as you sweep in and towards
your chest.

• Achieving a compact arm stroke
How to do this drill
Step 1: Float face down in the water with your arms extended, hands forming a

breaststroke arm stroke. Pitch your hands to sweep the water out just wider than
your shoulders, then make a tight turn and sweep the water in and back towards
your chest producing lift enough to get a quick breath.
Step 2: In order to avoid creating drag, your goal should be to create the smallest,
quickest arm stroke possible that will produce enough lift so you can breathe. Try it

. ELBOW GREASE
The purpose of this drill
• Using a high elbow position
• Knowing when to fold the elbows in
• Avoiding drag
How to do this drill
Step 1: Stand in waist-deep water. Bend forward at the hips so your chest and
shoulders are in the water and your chin is on the water’s surface so you can observe
your arm movement throughout this drill. Extend your arms in front of you. Stretch
from the elbows and position your hands in a point.
Step 2: Trace the path of the breaststroke arms. Sweep out beyond your shoulders
maintaining straight elbows, then sweep in and back towards your chest maintain-
ing a high elbow position. To achieve the high elbow position, your hands must
move first, and your elbows must stay still until your hands are at the same width
as your elbows. Try it several times focusing on your elbows.
Step 3: Only as you hands come
together at the end of the insweep
should you allow your elbows to drop

shape in the water. Some swimmers
bring their elbows in to the sides of
their ribs, others bring their elbows and
forearms together in front of their chest.

RECOvERY DRILLS
Like the other strokes, recovery in breaststroke brings the arms back to the starting
position, traveling in the reverse direction of the power phase. But in breaststroke
the recovery is unique because it happens underwater, making it a major source of
drag in the stroke. Swimmers must practice being as streamlined as possible at this
point in the stroke, and to perform the recovery quickly so that the effects of drag
do not eliminate progress in their stroke. Use the following drills to improve your
recovery technique in breaststroke.

. SPEED RECOvERY
The purpose of this drill
• Practicing a quick recovery
• Transitioning from power phase to recovery
• Avoiding drag
How to do this drill
Step 1: Float face down in the water with your arms extended, hands forming a
point. Do a gentle flutter kick to produce forward motion. Trace the path of the
breaststroke arm stroke. Sweep the water out and in and back towards your chest
producing lift enough to get a quick breath. At the very end of the power phase,
your palm should come together and your elbows should fold inward.
Step 2: At the point when you have achieved lift, near the end of the power phase,
there is a temptation to stop moving your arms, but don’t do it! Instead, continue
to accelerate your arms into the recovery. In fact, the recovery should be the fastest
part of your stroke. As your palms come together at the end of the insweep, extend
your arms forward in a tight arrow to cut through the water with as little drag as
possible, and producing the fastest movement of the arm stroke.
Step 3: Try it again. Make the arm stroke

motion. Sweep the water out, then in,
then accelerate through the recovery
until your arms are extended straight in
front of you at the starting point. Only

. GET BACK TO STREAMLINE
The purpose of this drill
• Returning to the downward balance point
• Being streamlined for more time
• Eliminating drag
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim breaststroke. Start by sweeping your hands out, then quickly inward
and back toward your chest achieving lift to breathe. As you breathe, slide your
heels up behind you and to the outside, flexing your feet at the end. Accelerate your
arms into the recovery returning your face to the water just before your hands reach
the extended position. Kick out and around with the soles of your feet, returning
your feet to the extended position just after your arms.
Step 2: Try it again. Sweep out and inward with your hands, and catch a breath.
Slide your feet up and out and flex your feet. Move your arms through the recovery
as your face goes back in the water. Kick out and around with the soles of your feet
until your legs are straight. Notice that when your arms and legs get back to the
streamline starting point, you continue moving through the water with no effort.
This is the glide position of the breaststroke, and the downward balance point. It is
the position with the least drag, and the position you want to spend the most time in.
Step 3: Continue practicing breast-
stroke getting back to streamline with
every stroke. Spend more time in the
glide position than in all other phases

BREATHING DRILLS
The forward breathing position in the breaststroke can be a major source of drag
when done incorrectly. If the line of the stroke is interrupted by an independent
movement of the head, forward momentum is broken. Done correctly, breaststroke
breathing requires no independent lifting of the head. This is achieved when the
breathing happens within the arm stroke, and as a function of the body being at
the upward balance point when it is time to inhale. As the upper body rises, the
face naturally clears the water to breathe. Use the following drills to improve your
breathing technique in breaststroke.

. INHALE WITH THE INSWEEP
The purpose of this drill
• Timing the inhale correctly
• Feeling lift
• Avoiding drag
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim breaststroke focusing on your two balance points. Start in the glide
position leaning into the downward balance point. Feel your body move forward in
the water with your hips higher than your chest. Now, begin the arm stroke by
sweeping out, then in and back towards your chest. Feel the balance of your body
change as you do the insweep. Feel your face rise as you produce lift with the
insweep. Inhale when your body achieves the upward balance point.
Step 2: Draw your heels up and out and flex your feet as your arms go through the
recovery. As you move into the power phase of the kick, your balance shifts again.
Feel your face return to the water as you approach the downward balance point.
Achieve streamline with your arms then your legs and glide.
Step 3: Try it again.

. EXHALE WITH THE KICK
The purpose of this drill
• Timing the exhale correctly
• Exhaling during the kick’s power phase
• Emptying the lungs before the inhale
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim breaststroke focusing on your breathing rhythm. Inhale at the high
point of the stroke, then exhale through the kick and glide. As with any physical
effort, it is important to expel air during the period of highest effort. In the case of
breaststroke, that is the power phase of the kick.
Step 2: Try it again. Inhale at the high point during the insweep. When your face
returns to the water within the recovery, exhale as you kick out and around with
force. Continue exhaling through the glide so that you expel all of your old air by
the time your face rises for the next inhale.
Step 3: Continue swimming breast-
stroke for several laps focusing on rhyth-
mically exhaling with the power phase

The purpose of this drill
• Maintaining a stable head position
• Achieving low profile breathing
• Avoiding lifting the chin to breathe
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim breaststroke focusing on maintaining a stable head position. Avoid
any nodding action to achieve a breath. From the glide position, you should be
looking at the bottom of the pool, not forward. Notice the position of your chin. It
is neutral, not lowered or raised. It should remain neutral throughout the stroke.
Step 2: Begin the arm stroke by sweeping out. Feel your upper body begin to rise
as your arm stroke produces lift. Feel your face begin to emerge from the water.
Maintain your neutral chin as you do your quick insweep and feel your face pop out
of the water without changing your chin position.
Step 3: You should be looking at the
water while you inhale. As your arms
move into recovery and your body shifts
downward, your face will submerge and
you should again be looking at the bot-

LEvERAGE DRILLS
Breaststroke action depends on leverage to overcome the drag that is part of this
largely underwater stroke. Leverage positively affects all aspects of breaststroke
including the kick, arm stroke, recovery and breathing. Using the two balance points
of the hips and the head, with the strong core in the middle, the swimmer can shift
his or her balance, angling the body downward and upward in an alternating
motion to achieve forward motion while minimizing drag. Use the following drills
to improve your leverage in breaststroke.

• Feeling the transitions
How to do this drill
Step 1: In the water, begin in the breaststroke glide position. Sweep your hands out,
then quickly in and back toward your chest as you draw your legs up and out in
preparation to kick. Breathe and accelerate into your recovery. Kick. When your face
begins to submerge, dive down deep into the water, exaggerating your downward
balance point. Glide.
Step 2: Just before the momentum of your glide slows, begin your next arm stroke.
From your deep position, your arm stroke must produce an exaggerated amount of
lift to shift to the upward balance point. Sweep out quickly, then in and back even
more quickly in order to get yourself up into breathing position.
Step 3: Breathe within the
recovery then kick with force.

. TEETER-TOTTER
The purpose of this drill
• Avoiding swimming flat
• Feeling the shift of balance
• Establishing stroke rhythm
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim breaststroke focusing on the rhythm of the stroke. As you go through
the arm stroke breathing, kick and glide motions of the stroke, feel your body shift
between the upward and downward balance points. Notice how the rhythm of the
breaststroke is defined by the highs and lows of the stroke.
Step 2: Swim breaststroke at a relaxed pace. Feel the rhythm of the stroke match
the slow pace as your body leans towards the lower balance point, and then shifts
to the upward balance point alternately, like the motion of a teeter-totter.
Step 3: Swim breaststroke at sprint speed. Feel the rhythm of the stroke speed up
as your body leans towards the downward balance point, and then shifts to the
upward balance point alternately like a teeter-totter.

. BREASTROKE WAvE
The purpose of this drill
• Utilizing the shift of balance
• Creating a forward wave
• Maintaining stable hips
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim breaststroke, shifting your balance to achieve the upward and down-
ward balance points alternately through every stroke. Feel the rhythmic up and
down movement of your stroke. Feel yourself stroke up and kick down.
Step 2: As you produce rhythm for your stroke by hitting the upward and downward
balance points alternately, notice that you also achieve the other functions of the
stroke simultaneously. As you perform the arm stroke and hit the upward balance
point, you also inhale at the high point of the stroke. As you perform the kick at hit
the downward balance point, you also position yourself for a productive glide.
Step 3: Try it again. Stroke up to breathe. Kick down to glide. Maintain your rhythm
as you shift from up to down and down to up. Feel the forward wave you have cre-
ated as you move through each stroke. Continue swimming breaststroke. Maintain
your rhythm. Maintain your forward wave.

. RIDE THE GLIDE
The purpose of this drill
• Maximizing the glide
• Using momentum
• Understanding the benefit of the glide
How to do this drill
Step 1: Push of the wall preparing to swim breaststroke. Stroke up to breathe, then
kick, but do not glide. Instead, go immediately into the next stroke. Continue swim-
ming breaststroke without a glide phase across the pool. Notice that you have to do
a lot of strokes.
Step 2: Let’s compare how many strokes it takes to
cross the pool with and without a glide. Again, swim
breaststroke across the pool with no glide following
the kick. Count each stroke. Now swim breaststroke
across the pool with a glide following the kick. Count
your strokes. Notice that you do significantly more
strokes without the glide, and it requires much more
effort.
Step 3: Now compare how long it takes. Using a clock,
time yourself swimming across the pool doing breast-
stroke with no glide. Time yourself again swimming
across the pool with a glide. Notice that the time is the
same or faster with a glide.
Figure 71: Maximize your momentum in the glide

How long should I glide? You should glide as long as it is productive. This
means that you should start your next stroke before
your glide momentum slows. If you wait until after
you slow down, you will have lost the benefit of your
glide, and will have to restart your forward motion
with each stroke, which is a lot of extra effort.

COORDINATION DRILLS
Even if every part of breaststroke is technically excellent, if they do not work
together the breaststroke will not work well. Due to the many points of potential
drag in the stroke and the overlapping sequence of the individual actions of the
stroke, breaststroke must be well-coordinated, or the stroke will fight itself. Use the
following drills to improve your coordination in breaststroke.

. 3-PHASE BREASTSTROKE
The purpose of this drill
• Identifying the parts of breaststroke
• Sequencing breaststroke correctly
• Feeling the correct timing
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim breaststroke focusing on the parts of the stroke: arm stroke, breathing,
kick and glide. Notice the sequence of these parts. Notice how they overlap. Notice
which parts happen at the same time.
Step 2: Continue swimming breaststroke focusing on the arm stroke and breathing.
Notice that they are so connected that they cannot be separated. Feel the unified
movement of the arm stroke and breathing action. Consider the arm stroke and
breathing as one part of the stroke.
Step 3: Continue swimming breaststroke focusing on the kick and the glide. Notice
that they are separate actions. The glide follows the kick. Feel the cause and effect
of the kick and the glide.
Step 4: Continue swim-
ming breaststroke focus-
ing on the three phases
of the stroke in order as
they happen: arm stroke

. COUNTING BREASTSTROKE
The purpose of this drill
• Getting back to streamline quickly
• Setting up to glide
• Maintaining good timing
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim breaststroke while you count the rhythm of your stroke. Use a eight-
beat count for the entire stroke sequence, the first four beats counting the arm
stroke and breathing, and the kick, and the second four beats counting the glide.
Step 2: Start by counting the arm stroke and breathing. Count “one” as you sweep
your hands out. Count “two” as you sweep your hands in, inhale and raise your feet
to kick. Count “three, four” as you recover, let your face submerge, and kick with
force back and around. And as you glide, count “five, six, seven eight.”

. BREASTSTROKE SILHOUETTE
The purpose of this drill
• Being aware of your shape in the water
• Knowing the space you occupy
• Eliminating drag
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim breaststroke. Imagine you are watching yourself swim from above.
Focus on your silhouette in the water in the glide position. Notice that it is long and
narrow, and shaped to move through the water well. Now, focus on your silhouette
in the water as you leave the glide position. Notice that you are shaped like a “Y”—
not a position you want to stay in long if you are to maintain forward motion. Now
focus on your shape as your hands finish the insweep. Notice that this is your short-
est and widest position—the position to move through fastest in order to avoid drag.
Finally, focus on your silhouette during the power phase of the kick. Notice that
although your kick is wide, it is travelling fast, and your arms that make your leading
edge are narrow.
Step 2: Swim breaststroke. Imagine you are watching
yourself swim from the side. Focus on your silhouette
in the water in the glide position. Notice that it is long
and narrow, and shaped to move through the water
well in a position aimed slightly downward. Now,
focus on your silhouette in the water as you leave the
glide position. Notice that although you are still long
and narrow, your balance has shifted to an upward

Drills for butterfly
BODY POSITION DRILLS
Like breaststroke, butterfly body position depends on a shifting balance along the
long axis of the body. And similar to breaststroke, the hips are at the center of this
shift. But unlike breaststroke, the body position for butterfly must accommodate an
over the water recovery and an arm stroke than extends to the hips, making body
balance and counter balance a priority issue in this stroke. Use the following drills
to improve your body position in butterfly.

The purpose of this drill
• Learning to float actively
• Feeling core stability
• Learning to shift floating positions
How to do this drill
Step 1: Take a big breath and float face down with your arms at your sides. Notice
that your legs and hips begin to sink a bit, leaving your body floating uphill. This is
an inactive floating position, and it not a position you want to stay in very long in
butterfly.
Step 2: To change this floating position, actively lean forward until your feel that
you are balancing on your chest. Your hips and legs should feel weightless and rise
as a result. Maintain this position using core stability. This is the basic floating posi-
tion for butterfly.
Step 3: Try it again. Float face down with your arms at your sides. Look at the bot-
tom of the pool. Actively press down with your chest and lift your ribs slightly to
shift your body position forward.
Step 4: Continue practic-
ing. Alternately achieve

. HANG FROM YOUR HIPS
The purpose of this drill
• Maintaining a high hip position
• Feeling the hips as the center of the stroke
• Establishing stability from the hips
How to do this drill
Step 1: Take a big breath and float face down with your arms at your sides. Achieve
the active floating position by leaning forward and balancing on your chest. Feel
your hips and legs rise.
Step 2: Now, actively lean forward even more, until you are slightly bent forward at
the hips and your chest and head are even lower in the water. Feel your hips and
legs remain at the surface of the water. It should feel as though you are hanging
from your hips. Maintain this position using core stability.
Step 3: Relax your pike and return to the original active floating position. Maintain
core stability as you are coming out of the pike position. Continue practicing active
floatation, hanging from your hips the whole time. First, actively lean forward and
let your hips and legs be weightless. Then shift into the pike position with your legs
and hips remaining at
the water’s surface.

. SHORT AND LONG BALANCE
The purpose of this drill
• Feeling butterfly balance
• Feeling how float length changes balance
• Shifting floating balance
How to do this drill
Step 1: Take a big breath and float face down in the water with your arms at your
sides. Achieve a natural floating position by allowing your legs to sink slightly. This
is the short float position.
Step 2: Again, take a big breath and float face down in the water, this time with
your arms extended in front of you. Achieve the active floating position by leaning
forward and balancing on your chest. With your arms extended, you will have to
press your chest down more to shift your balance forward. Feel your hips and legs
rise.
Step 3: As you lower your chest in the water, let your extended arms remain on the
surface of the water, aiming forward, not down. Hang from your hips. This is your

KICK DRILLS
The dolphin, used in the butterfly is more than a kicking action. It is a full body
action that starts at the head and flows down through the legs. We see and feel the
dolphin most in the legs, because it is moving at the greatest speed and with the
greatest force by the time it gets down to the legs. But without initiating this action
high in the body, the dolphin is much less powerful. So, when doing drills for dol-
phin, don’t limit your focus to only the legs. Use the following drills to improve your
dolphin technique in butterfly.

The purpose of this drill
• Feeling full body dolphin
• Initiating dolphin high in the body
• Flowing dolphin through the body
How to do this drill
Step 1: Take a big breath and float face down in the water with your arms at your
sides. Look at the bottom of the pool. Achieve the active floating position by lean-
ing forward and balancing on your chest.
Step 2: From your active floating position, begin the dolphin by lowering your fore-
head, then your chin, then your chest, then flip that movement through your hips
to your thighs, your knees and finally to your feet. Try it again with more speed.
Create a whip like motion that starts with your head and moves with increasing
speed and force through the length of your body and ends with a snap of your feet.
Step 3: Practice more. Notice that by the time you have transferred the dolphin
action down to your hips, your upper body begins to rise, as the power continues to
move down your legs to your feet.

ARM STROKE DRILLS
The powerful butterfly arm stroke is not as hard as it looks. It actually resembles
freestyle in many ways, except that butterfly uses a simultaneous stroke, and there-
fore depends on long axis leverage, instead of the side-to-side roll of freestyle. The
butterfly stroke gets its power from the center of the body, making the role of the
hands simply to hold on to the water, rather than to lead the stroke. Use the follow-
ing drills to improve your arm stroke technique in butterfly.

The purpose of this drill
• Finding the best catch position
• Feeling the water
• Setting the arms in the water
How to do this drill
Step 1: Float face down in the water with your arms extended in front of you. Hook
your feet over a lane line, or in the pool gutter. Prepare to practice the catch of the
butterfly arm stroke.
Step 2: Achieve the active float position by lowering your chest in the water and
maintain a high hip position. Although your body is aimed downward from the hips,
keep your extended arms and hands at the surface of the water. Pitch your hands
slightly palms-out and drive your chest down further resulting in your hands moving
outward just outside your shoulders.
Step 3: From your wide set hand position
at the surface of the water, press down
on the water a few inches at the same
time as you raise your chest slightly. This
is the catch position for butterfly. Feel
the water pressing against your hands.

The purpose of this drill
• Feeling how body position affects the arm stroke
• Leaning in to the pull
• Leaning out of the push
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim butterfly. Extend your arms in front of you and press your chest down
achieving an active floating position with stable, high hips. Do serveral dolphins in
this position and make a wide catch with your hands near the surface of the water
by pressing down on the water as your chest rises slightly. Sweep your hands back

close together under your belly feel your floating position change. Accelerate your
arms into the push moving them quickly back and out from your hips as your chest
rises to its highest point and your feet snap down.
Step 2: Try it again. Start by leaning into your stroke to catch and pull, then lean
out of your stroke to push. Notice that your feet snap down at the conclusion of your
full body dolphin as you lean into your stroke, helping you achieve depth with your
chest. Notice that your feet snap down at the conclusion of your full body dolphin

• Feeling the deep and shallow points in the arm stroke
• Achieving a sweeping arm stroke
• Holding on to the water
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim six good butterfly strokes. Start with a few rhythmic dolphins then
lean into your catch then pull around, back and inward under your body in a
smooth, sweeping action. As you transition to the push, accelerate your arms as
your body leans out of the stroke. Notice that your while you are leaning into your
stroke and pulling, your arms travel deeper, and while you are leaning out of your
stroke and pushing, your arms travel shallower.
Step 2: Rest, then swim six more good butterfly strokes. Lean in and pull deep, then
lean out and push shallow. Notice that not only does your arm stroke follow a
sweeping line from front to back, it also follows a sweeping line from deep to
shallow.
Step 3: Continue practicing the sweeping arm stroke of butterfly, accelerating front
to back and deep to shallow.

. FINISH AND RELEASE
The purpose of this drill
• Feeling the arm stroke’s fast finish
• Feeling the direction of the push
• Learning to release the water
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim butterfly focusing on the transition from pull to push. Actively acceler-
ate your motion towards the finish of each stroke. This is the fastest part of the arm
stroke, and the part that produces the most lift. It is also the part that ends the arm
stroke, signaling your hands to let go of the water. What is the best way to accom-
plish this?
Step 2: Try pushing the water back past your hips as in freestyle. Notice that your
push produces a good surge forward for your body. Notice too that following the
push, it is as if your arms get stuck at your sides underwater, leaving you unable to
move into the next phase of the stroke.
Step 3: Try pushing the water back to your hips and then up to the surface of the
water. Notice that your push back produces a good surge forward for your body.
Notice too that the push upward, while accomplishing the task of getting your
hands out of the water, is very difficult and slow
because you are lifting water upward.
Step 4: Now try pushing the water back to your
hips and then pressing your hands out away

Done well, the butterfly recovery is a dramatic sight that leaves no doubt that the
swimmer knows what he or she is doing in the water. The characteristic double arm
recovery of the butterfly is not only a way to get the arms back in position for
another stroke, it can also add momentum, balance and alignment to the stroke.

The purpose of this drill
• Feeling a unified recovery
• Using core strength
• Building momentum
How to do this drill
Step 1: Stand in front of a full-length mirror. Bend forward at the hips. Extend your
arms in front of you towards the mirror. Perform the butterfly arm stroke as if you
were in the water. Catch wide and sweep your hands around and back and pull
under your body, then push back and outward quickly to finish.
Step 2: Notice that at the very end of your arm stroke, when your hands push out
to the widest point as if releasing the water, that a perfect arch forms from your left
hand, up your left arm, through your chest and shoulders, down your right arm to
your right hand. Move your arms forward into the recovery. Feel the power of your
recovery arch.
Step 3: Try it in the water. Push off the wall with your arms extended and do several
quick dolphins then lean into your wide catch and sweep the water around and
back then pull under your body. Lean up and transition to the push back and out
from your hips, then release the water to recover. Feel the strong arch form from
hand to hand through your shoulders and chest.

How to do this drill
Step 1: Stand in waist deep water and bend forward at the hips until your face is
submerged. Extend your arms in front of you. Trace the path of the butterfly arm
stroke in the water. Catch, pull, and push the water back and out from your sides.
Feel your hands emerge from the water.
Step 2: Looking at yourself in this position from above, you would see that your
hands exit the water behind your shoulders, and your fingers would be pointing
back towards your feet. Your hands should stay behind your shoulders through most
of the recovery. Try the arm stroke and recovery again. Catch, pull, push, release.
Feel your hands leave the water. Feel your hands follow your shoulders into the
recovery.
Step 3: It is only after your arms reach the widest point in the recovery that your
hands move ahead of your shoulders in order to line up for the entry. Try it again.
At the finish of the arm stroke, as your hands release and emerge from the water,
feel them relax, and trail the recovery, letting the larger muscles towards the middle
of your body do the work.

BREATHING DRILLS
The forward breathing style of butterfly can help or hinder the forward line of the
stroke. Ideally, breathing should be done low to the water, and follow a parallel rise
and fall to the arms. Good breathing in butterfly takes no independent action of the
head because it happens when the upper body is at its highest point. It is only when
breathing is timed incorrectly that it causes problems that can divert momentum
away from the forward line, and interrupt the rhythm of the stroke that is extremely
important to maintain. Use the following drills to improve your breathing technique
in butterfly.

. TURTLE
The purpose of this drill
• Lengthening the neck
• Maintaining the forward line of the stroke
• Inhaling low to the water
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim butterfly breathing each stroke. Inhale at the high point. Maintain
your forward line in the water when your face rises by staying low in the water.
Step 2: To enhance your forward line while breathing, focus on your neck. When
striving to inhale low in the water, it is common to raise the shoulders and let your
neck and head retract between them. Instead, as your face emerges from the water,
extend your neck forward like a turtle coming out of its shell. Try it several times.
Step 3: At the high point of the stroke, while you are breathing, keep your chin on
the surface of the water. Let your neck be as long as possible, directing you forward
while you inhale. Practice again. Observe the water you leave behind with each
stroke from your low and longer breathing position.

. HEAD THEN HANDS
The purpose of this drill
• Returning the head to the water early
• Maintaining the rhythm of the stroke
• Maintaining the forward line of the stroke
How to do this drill
Step 1: Float face down in the water with your left arm extended in front of you
and your right arm at your side. Swim butterfly with your extended arm only. Focus
on achieving the high and the low point of the stroke. Focus on achieving a full
body dolphin that flows down to your feet. Focus on maintaining high hips. Focus
on the rhythm of the stroke.
Step 2: Now focus on your breathing. Inhale at the high point of the stroke, when
your arms are pushing back to the finish. As your arms move forward into the recov-
ery, let your face return to the water with them.
Step 3: Notice that while your face and your arms travel downward in unison, the
path that your arms are traveling is much longer than that of the face. Continue
swimming butterfly with one arm focusing on returning your face to the water with
your recovering arms.
Step 4: While the face and the arms are moving back into the water at the same
time, the relatively short path that the face travels back to the water, compared to
the arms means that the face should enter the water an instant before the hands.
Try it again, focusing on feeling your head enter the water and then your hands.

water after breathing at the same time that you are nearing the end of your recov-
ery and your hands are preparing to enter the water. Feel that although both your
face and your hands are moving together, because your face is closer to the water,
it hits the water before your hands. Continue practicing, saying to yourself, “head,

. BREATHING RHYTHMS
The purpose of this drill
• Experiencing different breathing rhythms
• Maintaining stroke rhythm
• Holding the forward line of the stroke
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim butterfly without breathing. Perform as many good rhythmic strokes
as you can. Focus on the forward line of your stroke. Without breathing, what hap-
pens at the high point of the stroke? The feet still snap down. The hand still move
quickly back and out from the hips. But the face stays in the water. For some swim-
mers who produce good lift, it is actually an effort to keep their face down. They
must lower their chin slightly and press their forehead into the water at the high
point of the stroke to maintain stroke rhythm. For others, breathing is a taxing part
of the stroke, and keeping their head down is welcome relief. However, breathing
must be part of the butterfly if it is going to be sustainable for any distance.
Step 2: Swim butterfly breathing every third stroke. Two strokes without breathing,
then one stroke breathing. This breathing rhythm may appeal to swimmers who find
breathing to be an extra effort, but who recognize that they must breathe occasion-
ally to fuel their stroke.
Step 3: Swim butterfly breathing every other stroke. One stroke without breathing,
then the next stroke breathing. This breathing rhythm may appeal to swimmers who
do not have strong feelings about breathing one way or another.
Step 4: Swim butterfly breathing every stroke. This breathing rhythm may appeal to
swimmers who find breathing to be an integral part of the high point of the stroke.

LEvERAGE DRILLS
Butterfly is all about leverage. Without it the stroke is very limited in terms of poten-
tial speed and power. Every aspect of the stroke depends on leverage to make it
work, from the shifting body position, the dolphin action and the arm stroke to the
breathing and coordination. With the hips as the center point of the stroke, leverage
drives butterfly from the hips up, from the hips down, and through the length of the
whole body. Use the following drills to improve your leverage in butterfly.

. PIKE
The purpose of this drill
• Feeling leverage high and low in the body
• Making use of leverage
• Using the hips as your fulcrum
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim several strokes of good rhythmic butterfly. Focus on hitting the high
and the low of the stroke with your hips remaining high the whole time. Once you
have established your stroke rhythm, freeze at the point when your arms are
extended in front of you and your hands are making their catch to begin the next
stroke. Notice that at this point in the stroke, both your chest and your feet are at
their lowest point. It is almost as if you are hanging from your hips.
Step 2: Try it again. Swim several strokes, then when your arms stretched forward
and catching the water for the next stroke, actively drop your chest down into the
water, farther than it usually descends, and let the dolphin flow down to your feet
and snap like the end of a whip. Notice that with your hips in theirs stable high
position, and your chest dropped deeper than usual into the water, that your body
is in a pike position, with your hips at the highest point, and your chest and feet
both low. From this position, leverage works in two directions. First, your arm stroke
is well set up to benefit from leverage from your core, and, at the same time that
your dolphin will benefit from leverage as it flows from your hips to your feet.

. THE MOTH
The purpose of this drill
• Understanding the benefits of leverage
• Feeling the effects of leverage
• Maintaining rhythm and your forward line
How to do this drill
Step 1: Instead of butterfly, swim the moth. The moth is butterfly with your hips as
low as possible. Keep them low throughout the stroke. Attempt to perform all the
actions of the stroke. Attempt to shift your body position. Attempt to do full body
dolphin. Attempt to breathe. Notice that all of these actions are extremely difficult
with low hips.
Step 2: Continue to swim the moth, focusing on the rhythm of your stroke. Notice
that without the ability to easily shift your body position, you lose an important
rhythmic element. Notice too that without the ability to flow your dolphin down to
your feet, you cannot produce two evenly spaced kicks.
Step 3: Continue to swim the moth, focusing on the forward line of your stroke.
Notice that with low hips, you must breathe up, rather than forward. Notice too that
with low hips, your kick works to lift you up, not move your forward.

. KICK AND CATCH, KICK AND BREATHE
The purpose of this drill
• Feeling leverage from the kick
• Maintaining stroke rhythm
• Keeping the forward line of the stroke
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim butterfly focusing on the rhythm of the kick, specifically when the feet
snap down at the end of the dolphin. One happens at the beginning of the stroke,
the other happens at the end. The kicks have a very predictable rhythmic because
they are evenly spaced within the stroke.
Step 2: Continue swimming butterfly focusing on the catch of the stroke. This very
important action initiates each stroke when the hands get a firm grip on the water.
Notice that your feet snap down at the same time as you catch giving you a better
handle on the water. Try it again. Feel the benefit of the kick as you catch.

COORDINATION DRILLS
Contrary to popular belief, butterfly is more a matter of coordination than strength.
While it is possible to simply power through the various actions of the stroke, it soon
becomes very tiring. When these stroke actions work together butterfly is not only
more graceful, it is more effective. By using the correct sequence and timing of
stroke elements, butterfly becomes a sustainable stroke. Use the following drills to
improve your coordination in butterfly.

. GRAB AND GO!
The purpose of this drill
• Avoiding a stall at the front of the stroke
• Maintaining stroke rhythm
• Making use of momentum
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim butterfly for several laps without stopping. Swim until your stroke feels
tired. As you fatigue, notice how the quality of your stroke deteriorates. Notice
exactly what happens. Your stroke rhythm suffers as your hands stall in the front of
your stroke. When your hands stall you eventually end up doing two kicks at the
front of the stroke. When you do two kicks at the front of the stroke you lose
momentum to finish your stroke fast and to breathe.
Step 2: Swim butterfly again. Eliminate any stall at the front of your stroke that will
cause your rhythm to suffer. As your hands enter the water wide and shallow, extend
your arms and grab hold of the water, immediately sweeping into your pull. Grab
and go!
Step 3: Now swim butterfly very fast for a short distance, increasing the tempo of
your stroke as much as possible. Grab and go with every stroke. Notice that when
your hands do not stall at the front of your stroke that your kicks are spaced evenly
through the stroke. One kick in front, one kick in back. Notice that when your kick
rhythm is even the finish of your stroke is much more effective, and your inhale is
much less effort.

The purpose of this drill
• Feeling light in the water
• Feeling high in the water
• Maintaining stroke rhythm
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim butterfly across the pool. Imagine you are swimming in a pool that is
only two feet deep. You must achieve the high and the low of the stroke within this
space. You must perform the deep to shallow arm stroke within this space. You must
achieve a full body dolphin that flows down to your feet within this space.
Step 2: You must accomplish all the actions of butterfly in very little depth. To
achieve this you must stay near the surface of the water, as if you were weightless.
Make each of your stroke actions count. Practice more concentrating the effect of
each action into less space.
Step 3: Swim butterfly across the pool again. Be light. Be high in the water. Make
every action quick and narrow. Make every action connect to the next. Make every
action count.

. FULL BODY FLY
The purpose of this drill
• Connecting stroke actions
• Feeling power from the core
• Utilizing momentum
How to do this drill
Step 1: Swim butterfly across the pool. Achieve the high and the low of the stroke.
Catch, pull and push. Recover in an arch over the water. Send your dolphin action
from high in your body down to your feet. Catch and kick, breathe and kick.
step 2: Notice what parts of the body you are using to move forward in the water.
Your head leads the stroke, providing alignment and balance. Your neck extends
during breathing to further the forward line of the stroke. Your shoulders create a
bridge of strength between the arms that work as unified force. Your hands catch
and hold on to the water through the sweeping pull and push of the stroke. Your
chest rises and falls as one of your lever points. Your core sends power to all four
limbs. Your hips stay high and act as the fulcrum of the stroke. Your legs receive the
dolphin action started high in your body and flow it to your feet that carry all of
the energy built in the body into a quick downward snap.
Step 3: Swim butterfly across the pool again feeling every part of your body con-
tribute to the forward motion of the stroke. Feel the chain reaction of stroke actions
as you swim. Feel all your power radiate from your core. Practice more.
