1 DULCODOS® Pool Swimming Pool Metering Systems
1.1 D 1.0.1Swim U ming po L ol techn C ology 20 O 15 DOS® Pool Swimming Pool Metering Systems
The metering systems DULCODOS® Pool ensure the best water quality. The systems are available
in four different designs. It is easy to work out which type is best suited to your requirements.
Chlorine or active oxygen?
Historically, swimming pool water has always been treated with chlorine. Because it is an effective
disinfectant and is highly oxidising, chlorine is also the chemical of choice for public pools. Clear and
hygienically safe water is guaranteed.
The metering systems DULCODOS® Pool reliably keep the operating parameters in an optimum range and
unpleasant side-effects, such as the smell of chlorine or burning eyes, are very rare.
Active oxygen is less effective than chlorine. It can be used for very gentle and environmentally-sound
water treatment in pools with fewer users.
(cid:2) Soft
DULCODOS® Pool Soft is especially suited to private pools used by a small number of people. It works with
active oxygen substances, which are less effective than chlorine. Water treatment with active oxygen is a
good alternative for ecologically-minded pool owners or if users are allergic to chlorine. DULCODOS® Pool
Soft uses no chlorine chemicals.
(cid:2) Basic
DULCODOS® Pool Basic regulates the pH and chlorine content using the redox potential. This is the direct
measurement of effective oxidation in the water and is therefore an indication of the disinfectant effect and
concentration of the metered chlorine. The concentration of chlorine cannot be determined with accuracy
with this process. ORP measurements allow a particular range of chlorine to be set. DULCODOS® Pool
Basic is robust and requires little maintenance.
(cid:2) Comfort
DULCODOS®Pool Comfort uses highly specific chlorine sensors to measure the chlorine content. The
concentration of chlorine in the water can be determined and set with accuracy. The effectiveness of the
pool filter is boosted by an integrated feeder assembly for flocculant, resulting in crystal-clear water!
Numerous features to enhance operating convenience, such as measured values being mapped by a
screen plotter or remote control from your PC, iPad or other tablet device using an integrated web server,
make the metering system very popular with customers.
(cid:2) Professional
In addition to the features described above, DULCODOS®Pool Professional also measures the combined
chlorine. This is an important parameter in public pools. It can be incorporated in the building management
system via OPC and KNX and alarm messages can be sent by text or e-mail. Eco!Mode operating mode
reduces the energy consumption of the filter pumps. The integrated soft PLC control can be used to operate
several peripheral devices and functions. The swimming pool controller becomes the central control unit
for all the swimming pool technology.

1 DULCODOS® Pool Swimming Pool Metering Systems
(cid:2) Choice of pumps
The metering systems DULCODOS®Pool allow you to choose which metering pump to fit on your complete
system. The choice of pump depends entirely on the size of your pool and how often it is used.
(cid:2) Peristaltic pumps DULCO®flex are suited to applications requiring few chemicals, such as small
pools or those used infrequently. The pump reliably eliminates bubbles of gas formed during periods of
non-use. Depending on the amount of use, the metering hose has to be replaced once or twice a year.
(cid:2) Motor-driven metering pumps alpha have a higher capacity and longer maintenance intervals. Like
peristaltic pumps, they are silent.
(cid:2) Solenoid metering pumps Beta® are not controlled by switching them on and off, like DULCO®flex or
alpha, instead, their metering frequency is adjusted continuously, enabling the pump to have an
extremely precise control action.
(cid:2) Pumps with CAN bus systemcan be used in the DULCODOS® Pool Professional series. They
communicate all operating messages, such as two-stage monitoring of the chemical reservoir, to the
control.
(cid:2) Accessories
Whether you are looking for collecting pans for chemical tanks or portable test devices for measurement
parameters – or even software for digital control: optional accessories make it even easier for you to
operate the system.
(cid:2) Service
Installation, commissioning, training in how the system works, operation and maintenance: When you buy
a DULCODOS®Pool system, it comes with service you can rely on – even if your pool is already quite old.

1.7 Test Equipment
1.7.1 Photometer
Precise measurement results through high-quality interference filters
Photometers measure nearly all disinfectants and the pH value based on the photometric principle. They
are portable, compact and make safe, simple measurement possible.
The photometers DT1B, DT2C, DT3B and DT4B are used, among other things, as a reference method for
calibrating the electrochemical sensors for chlorine, chlorine dioxide, fluoride, chlorite, H O , bromine and
2 2
ozone. They have been adapted to today's requirements and can be used in almost all areas of water
analysis. High-quality interference filters and long-term stable LEDs are used as the light source in the high-
precision optics. The entire measuring unit is maintenance-free. Precise and reproducible analysis results
are achieved with minimum time and effort. The units are winning customers over with their excellent
operating convenience, ergonomic design, compact dimensions and ease of use.

The DULCO®flex DF3a was specifically developed for metering fragrances in wellness facilities. This pump
can be used wherever fragrances are metered in small quantities. Typical applications include the aroma
infusion of douse water in saunas, steambaths, and whirlpools.
The metering pump is equipped with a process timer controlling two further peristaltic pumps for other
essences. Since the essences used in saunas should not be used undiluted on the oven, the DF3a is
equipped with three relays for controlling the diluent water.
To save essences when the sauna is not in use, the pump features a contact input to which e.g. a door
contact or motion sensor can be connected. This ensures that fragrances are only metered when the sauna
is in use.

3 Ozone Systems
3.0.1Swimming pool technology 2015
3.1 Ozone for Swimming Pool Water
The use of ozone drastically solves the problems of the build-up of chloramine or THM experienced with
conventional water treatment. It is the most intensive oxidising agent approved for use in water treatment
processes and is usually added before the filter stage. With this system, undesirable substances in the
water, such as chloramine and turbidity, are oxidised and retained in the filter.
To successfully use ozone in swimming pool water treatment, it must be added in adequate quantities and,
above all, dissolved in the water. This is why a high concentration is needed when generating ozone. The
addition of chlorine is also necessary when using ozone for safe disinfection, as ozone must not be present
in the pool water.
The result is much clearer water without a typical indoor swimming pool odour. Moreover, the content of
trihalomethanes significantly drops below the limit values.
The use of ozone in swimming pool technology is particularly valuable as
(cid:2) the water does not smell, the air indoors is pleasant and healthy
(cid:2) the clarity of the water improves considerably due to the flocculating effect of the ozone and
(cid:2) the ozone decomposes on reacting with oxygen, a desirable factor in the water.
The use of ozone in therapy pools is a requirement in Germany.
3.2 Ozone System OZONFILT®OZVa
3.2.1 Ozone System OZONFILT®OZVa
OZONFILT® OZVa ozone plants have been designed as pressurised systems, in which the operating gas
– air or oxygen – is fed into the ozone generator under pressure. The ozone is generated using medium-
frequency high voltage and is primary current controlled. The introduction of PCC (primary current
controlled) technology, specially developed in-house by ProMaqua, provides complete protection for the
electrical components (high-voltage transformer and power stage) and also permits the correct digital
display of the ozone feed rate in “grams/hour”. As a result, any required ozone volume between 3 and
100 % of the nominal capacity can be set reproducibly, and largely independently of voltage and pressure
fluctuations.
The use of an integrated pressure swing dryer and a dielectric with optimum thermal conductivity makes
the plant extremely compact. The unique design of the generator ensures outstanding cooling performance
with low cooling water consumption and removes the heat produced quickly before the ozone produced
can decompose due to excessive heat.
Operation under pressure means that the ozone generated can be introduced directly into water systems
with back pressures of up to 2 bar. Additional booster pumps and injectors can therefore be dispensed with
in many applications.
Combined with DULCOMETER® measuring and control technology and DULCOTEST® OZE ozone
sensors, these systems are especially suitable for use where the operation is dependent on, and is
controlled, by the measured data.
Features
(cid:2) Simple operation
(cid:2) Fully equipped
(cid:2) High efficiency
(cid:2) Low consumption of energy and cooling water
(cid:2) High ozone concentration thanks to operation with oxygen
(cid:2) PCC technology ensures complete protection of electrical components
(cid:2) Correct digital display of ozone output in g/h
(cid:2) Reproducible setting of the desired ozone quantity between 3 and 100 % of nominal capacity

3 Ozone Systems
3.2.2 OZONFILT® OZVa 1-4 Ozone Production Systems
(Operating Gas - Air)
Under nominal conditions, the series OZVa 1 – 4 produces up to 40 g/h of ozone from oxygen in the ambient
air at a concentration of 20g/Nm3. Using the designated mixing devices, ozone concentrations of between
3 and 12 ppm can be achieved in the water to be treated, depending on the temperature (theoretical value
at 30 and/or 0°C).
Types OZVa 1 and 2 are installed in a control cabinet for wall mounting; types OZVa 3 and 4 are installed
in a free-standing cabinet.
Provide an adequate supply of compressed air and a mixing unit designed for the operating conditions for
operation of the ozone system.
Mixing equipment
OZVa 1 can be ordered in the following designs:
(cid:2) Transparent mixing system with flow control mounted on the side of the system (see Fig.
pk_7_001_1_V2)
(cid:2) PVC static helical mixer mounted directly below the system, with 4 helical blades (pressure drop approx.
0.4 bar at maximum throughput) (see Fig. pk_7_042_V2)
pk_7_001_1_V2 (cid:2) Without mixing system for connection of 12/10 mm stainless steel pipes or 12/9 mm PTFE pipes
OZONFILT® OZVa 1; capacity: 5 g/h
OZVa 2 can be ordered in the following designs:
(cid:2) PVC static helical mixer mounted directly below the system, with 4 helical blades (pressure drop approx.
0.4 bar at maximum throughput) (see Fig. pk_7_042_V2)
(cid:2) Without mixing system for connection of 12/10 mm stainless steel pipes or 12/9 mm PTFE pipes
OZVa 3 and 4 are delivered, in principle, as designs without mixing system; order a suitable mixing system
separately (see Fig. pk_07_043_V2).
PVC or Stainless Steel Static Helical Mixer see p. → 3-33
pk_7_042_V2
OZONFILT® OZVa 2; capacity: 15 g/h Notes
(cid:2) The length of ozone gas-transporting pipes and the number of joints should be kept to a minimum. All
rooms with a removable joint are to be monitored with a gas detector according to applicable German
accident prevention regulations. All OZONFILT® systems are equipped for fitting a gas detector, such
as a GMA 36 Ozon (see accessories).
(cid:2) The ozone generator must be interlocked with the water flow into the metering point on all installations.
(cid:2) A non-return valve should be installed upstream of the OVZa to prevent any return of ozonised water
into the ozone-transporting pipe.

3.4 Ozone System OZONFILT® Compact OMVa
3.4.1 Ozone System OZONFILT® Compact OMVa
Individually adaptable thanks to modular construction
Ozone capacity 5 to 70 g ozone/h
The OZONFILT® Compact OMVa is a complete, ready-to-use ozone system. The components are
perfectly coordinated to each other.
The ozone system OZONFILT® Compact OMVa has a modular construction mounted on a stainless steel
frame. It can therefore be simply adapted to and integrated in the respective application.
A sufficient quantity and constant concentration of ozonised water is produced in the system's reaction
tank. From there it is pumped to where it is needed. The required ozone concentration can be adjusted and
is continuously controlled and held constant by a measuring and control circuit. Depending on the
application, the ozonised water is pumped by system pressure or with one or more discharge pumps to
where it is needed.
With the removal and replenishment of water in the storage tank, the air, which contains ozone, is
discharged out via the water phase and via a residual ozone gas destructor. Ensure that no ozone escapes
into the ambient air in normal operation.

B Raw water
This module comprises an ozone metering point and a downstream mixing section made of stainless steel,
with a series of static mixing elements for intensive mixing of the ozone/air mix with the water to be treated.
The lines carrying the ozone, and the pipework from the raw water connection to the inlet to the reaction
tank are made throughout in stainless steel and have been factory-pressure tested.
An injector for sucking out ozone is not needed with back pressures of up to 1.8 bar because the ozone is
generated at positive pressure.
Reaction tank module (12):
The stainless steel reaction tank incorporates all the necessary fittings for water distribution and an
automatic bleed valve (13). The ozone generation module (1), the residual ozone gas destructor (14) and
room air monitor (16) are mounted on this storage tank (12).

3.5.2 Residual Ozone Gas Destructor
Residual ozone gas destruction is used to remove traces of ozone gas from the exhaust air coming from
the reaction tank. Because the exhaust air from the reaction tank still contains water, the pipework should
be suitably routed so as to ensure that the water is drained off at the inlet side.
A suitable drainage connection should be provided here too as the exhaust air after the residual ozone gas
destructor is still up to 100 % saturated with water vapour, and because small temperature fluctuations,
even on the outlet side, can lead to flowback of condensate.
The exhaust air from any downstream filter plant that may be fitted can also be routed via this ozone gas
destruction unit.

3.6 Ozone System OZONFILT® OZMa
Powerful and yet environmentally-friendly. Disinfect and oxidise ecologically and economically.
Ozone capacity 70 to 735 g ozone/h
OZONFILT® OZMa represents maximum operational safety with minimal operating costs. The ozone
generator is maintenance-free and generates up to 735 g/h of ozone from compressed air or oxygen.
The ozone systems OZONFILT® OZMa have been designed as pressurised systems, in which the
operating gas – air or oxygen – is fed into the ozone generator under pressure.
Air is used as the operating gas in the ozone system Ozonfilt® OZMaA types 1 to 6
The ozone is generated from the oxygen in the ambient air and simultaneously metered. A demand-led,
self-optimising pressure swing dryer reduces the consumption of compressed air to a minimum. Ozone can
therefore be generated operationally safely and reliably even with a high level of ambient air humidity with
ozone concentrations of up to 20 g/Nm3. Ozone concentrations of between 3 and 12 ppm can be achieved
in the water to be treated with suitable mixing units, depending on the temperature.
Oxygen is used as the operating gas in the ozone system Ozonfilt® OZMaO type 1 to 6
Operation with oxygen permits ozone generation with ozone concentrations of up to 150 g/Nm3. Depending
on the system type, ozone is produced in 1-3 generators from oxygen provided from special oxygen
generators or bottles. Using the suitable mixing equipment, ozone concentrations of up to 90 ppm can be
achieved in the water to be treated, depending on the temperature.
Your benefits

3.6.1 Ozone Generation Systems OZONFILT® OZMa 1-6 A
(Operating Gas - Air)
Under nominal conditions, the OZMa 1-6 A range produces up to 420 g/h of ozone from compressed air at
a concentration of 20 g/Nm3. Using the designated mixing devices, ozone concentrations of between 3 and
12 ppm can be achieved in the water to be treated, depending on the temperature (theoretical value at 30
or 0 °C).
Different feature options can be achieved by combining different Identity code characteristics.
The plants are pre-mounted ready for connection in a painted steel cabinet (optional stainless steel control
cabinet) and need only be connected to a single-phase voltage supply, compressed air, cooling water/
waste water and ozone metering point on the customer's site.
An adequate compressed air supply and a mixing device designed for the operating conditions should be
integrated for operation of the ozone plant.
Order Information for OZONFILT® OZMa Systems see p. → 3-44, PVC or Stainless Steel Static Helical
Mixer see p. → 3-33
Mixing equipment
All OZMa systems are delivered, in principle, without a mixing unit and a suitable mixing system has to be
ordered separately. When selecting a suitable mixing system, please note that the mixing of ozone is more
P_PMA_OF_0010_SW efficient the higher the water flow in the mixing system. Accordingly design the mixing system so that the
flow of the water to be treated is at the upper range of the flow specification.
PVC or Stainless Steel Static Helical Mixer see p. → 3-33
Notes on installation
Keep the length of ozone gas transporting pipes and the number of joints to a minimum. All rooms with a
removable joint should be monitored with a gas detector in line with the applicable German accident
prevention regulations. All OZONFILT® systems are equipped for fitting a gas detector such as GMA 36
Ozon.
Ozonisation adds a large amount of gas to the water of which only a small percentage can dissolve.
Adequate bleeding should therefore be integrated. Because the gases discharged in this way have a
considerable residual ozone concentration, appropriate residual ozone destructors should be installed.
The ozone generator should be interlocked with the water flow into the metering point for all installations.
A non-return valve should be installed between OZMa and the ozone metering point to prevent any return
of ozonised water into the ozone-transporting pipe.

3.6.2 Ozone Generation Systems OZONFILT® OZMa 1-6 O
(Operating Gas - Oxygen)
Under nominal conditions, the OZMa 1-6 O range produces up to 735 g/h of ozone from oxygen at a
concentration of up to 150 g/Nm3. Using the designated mixing devices, ozone concentrations in the water
to be treated of up to 90 ppm can be achieved (theoretical value at 0 °C). Ozone concentration in g/Nm3
and system feed rate in g/h can be varied depending on the operating conditions and can thus be
individually matched to the application conditions. Examples for various combinations are listed in the
technical data table.
Different feature options can be achieved by combining different Identity code characteristics.
The systems are pre-mounted ready for connection in a painted steel cabinet (optional stainless steel
control cabinet) and should only be connected to a single-phase voltage supply, oxygen, cooling water/
waste water and ozone metering point on the customer's site.

efficient the higher the water flow in the mixing system. Accordingly design the mixing system so that the
flow of the water to be treated is at the upper range of the flow specification.
We recommend using stainless steel mixing systems because of the high ozone concentrations. Mixing
systems made of PVC can have a reduced service life, depending on the operating conditions.
PVC or Stainless Steel Static Helical Mixer see p. → 3-33
Notes on installation
Keep the length of ozone gas transporting pipes and the number of joints to a minimum. All rooms with a
removable joint should be monitored with a gas detector in line with the applicable German accident
prevention regulations. All OZONFILT® systems are equipped for fitting a gas detector such as GMA 36
Ozon.
Depending on the operating and installation conditions, it might be necessary to also monitor the room air
for excessive oxygen content. The gas detector GMA 36 Oxygen can be used for this purpose.
All gas-transporting accessories should be resistant to ozone and oxygen (e. g. fat-free).
Ozonisation adds a large amount of gas to the water of which only a small percentage can dissolve.
Adequate bleeding should therefore be integrated. Because the gases discharged this way have a
considerable residual ozone concentration, appropriate residual ozone destructors should be installed.
Because of the high ozone concentrations, only catalytic residual ozone destructors can be used. Active
carbon-based residual ozone destructors ignite spontaneously if subjected to increased ozone
concentrations.
The ozone generator must be interlocked with the water flow into the metering point for all installation.
A non-return valve should be installed between OZMa and ozone metering point to prevent any return of
ozonised water into the ozone-transporting pipe.

4 Disinfection and Oxidation Process
4.1 C 4.0.1Swim H ming po L ol techn O ology 201 R 5 INSITU® Electrolysis Systems
Chlorine and sodium hydroxide are produced in-situ in electrolysis by passing an electric current through
salt water.
In open or tubular cell electrolysis (type CHLORINSITU® II), the electrochemical reaction takes place
in a flow chamber, so that the freshly produced active chlorine immediately reacts with the sodium
hydroxide to form sodium hypochlorite. A saturated brine is used as a salt solution, which is produced in a
separate salt dissolving tank from salt of a defined quality. The advantage of tubular cell electrolysis lies in
the simple construction of the equipment, its ease of maintenance and low investment compared with
diaphragm electrolysis systems. The disadvantage is the relatively poor output (50%) of brine, higher
entrainment of chloride into the water to be treated, higher power consumption and relatively low chlorine
concentrations (5 g/l FAC) in the end product.
In diaphragm electrolysis, the electrochemical reaction takes place in two electrode chambers separated
by a diaphragm, so that the formation of the freshly produced active chlorine and sodium hydroxide is
physically separated. Systems of type CHLORINSITU® III and CHLORINSITU® III Compact bring the
reaction mixtures of both electrode chambers together again after the electrochemical reaction to produce
a stock solution of sodium hypochlorite (25 g/l FAC), which can be stored temporarily and metered as
needed.
With systems of type CHLORINSITU® IV Compact and CHLORINSITU® , the highly pure active chlorine is
fed into the water to be treated through an injector and under constant vacuum, where it dissolves as
hypochlorous acid. In systems of type CHLORINSITU® V plus, any excess active chlorine gas produced is
combined with the sodium hydroxide, as in the CHLORINSITU® III system, to form sodium hypochlorite and
is then stored temporarily. The systems therefore only need to be designed for average chlorine demand,
as peaks of capacity can be compensated for from the sodium hypochlorite temporary storage tank. In all
systems of types CHLORINSITU® IV Compact, CHLORINSITU® V and CHLORINSITU® V Plus, the
sodium hydroxide produced during electrolysis is stored temporarily and metered in, as required, to correct
the pH value.
The advantage of diaphragm systems lies in their excellent efficiency (85% brine output) and minimal
entrainment of chloride compared with open tubular cell systems. With systems of type CHLORINSITU® V
and CHLORINSITU® V Plus, the entrainment of chloride and chlorate from the electrolysis cell into the
water to be treated can be avoided completely. In diaphragm cell electrolysis system for producing sodium
hypochlorite, the higher output results in solutions with a significantly higher chlorine content than is the
case with tubular cell electrolysis.

4 Disinfection and Oxidation Process
4.2 Membrane Electrolysis Systems CHLORINSITU® III - IV compact
Electrolysis system of type CHLORINSITU® IV generate ultra-pure active chlorine in a vacuum process. A
saturated solution of sodium chloride is produced in a salt dissolving tank, included in the scope of delivery
for this purpose, which is then electrolysed in a diaphragm cell. Sodium hydroxide and hydrogen are
produced in the cathode chamber while ultra-pure active chlorine and dilute residual brine are produced in
the anode chamber, separated by the diaphragm from the cathode chamber. The resulting active chlorine
is suctioned off through an injector integrated in the system and dissolved as hypochlorous acid in the water
being treated. The hydrogen generated is discharged to the fresh air through a bleed line. The sodium
hydroxide is disposed of or optionally used by a metering pump integrated in the system to correct the pH
of the water being treated. The salt-dissolving water comes from a softener integrated in the system,
thereby preventing the formation of lime deposits and ensuring the long service life of the electrolytic cell.
The microprocessor controller integrated in the system digitally indicates the current output and monitors
all key functions. All operating and error messages are shown in plain text on the clear display. The output
can be controlled manually, automatically (controller option) or externally.
Electrolysis systems of type CHLORINSITU® IV Compact are especially suitable for use with smaller
swimming pools in residential properties and hotels (indoor pools with a total circulation capacity of up to
25m3/hour, chlorinated in accordance with the DIN standard).

4 Disinfection and Oxidation Process
4.5 Electrolysis System CHLORINSITU® II
Electrolysis systems of the type CHLORINSITU® II generate sodium-calcium hypochlorite with a
concentration of 5g/l. A saturated solution of sodium chloride is produced in a salt dissolving tank, included
in the scope of delivery for this purpose, which, after appropriate dilution, is electrolysed in an open tubular
cell. The resulting solution is collected in a storage tank and, from there, metered according to requirements
using separate metering pumps. Due to its moderate pH value of 8.5 – 9, it affects the pH of the treated
water significantly less than if conventional sodium-calcium hypochlorite with a pH of 12 – 13.5 were used.
Much less acid is used to adjust the pH value, enabling savings of up to 80%. The hydrogen always
produced during electrolysis is diluted with fresh air through an ATEX 95-approved fan and discharged
safely. Both the salt-dissolving and diluting water comes from a softener unit integrated in the system,
preventing the formation of lime deposits and ensuring the long service life of the electrolytic cell. There is
therefore no need for acid purification. The systems are controlled using a modern PLC with a large,
illuminated display and integrated Remote Control Engineer for remote diagnosis and troubleshooting.
Electrolysis systems of type CHLORINSITU® II are especially suitable for applications where a robust and
clearly laid out technology is required and where the entrainment of residual sodium chloride into the water
being treated is not a problem.

4 Disinfection and Oxidation Process
4.6 Electrolysis System CHLORINSITU® III
Electrolysis systems of type CHLORINSITU® III generate sodium hypochlorite with a higher concentration
of approximately 25 g/l with minimal entrainment of sodium chloride (85% output) from the diaphragm cell
into the finished product. A saturated solution of sodium chloride is produced in a salt dissolving tank,
included in the scope of delivery for this purpose, which is then electrolysed in a diaphragm cell. Sodium
hydroxide and hydrogen are produced in the cathode chamber while ultra-pure active chlorine and a diluted
residual brine are produced in the anode chamber, separated by the diaphragm from the cathode chamber.
The resulting active chlorine is bound to the sodium hydroxide through an injector under a constant vacuum
and is collected as sodium hypochlorite in a storage tank. The vacuum is kept constant by a frequency-
controlled circulation pump. This creates less mechanical stress on the diaphragm in the electrolysis cell
and in other parts of the system. The complete sodium hypochlorite solution can be metered, as required,
by separate metering pumps. Due to its moderate pH value of 9.5 – 10, it affects the pH of the treated water
significantly less than if conventional sodium-calcium hypochlorite with a pH of 12 – 13.5 were used. Much
less acid is used to adjust the pH value, enabling savings of up to 70%. The hydrogen always produced
during electrolysis is diluted with fresh air through an ATEX 95-approved fan and discharged safely. The
salt-dissolving water comes from a softener integrated in the system, thereby preventing the formation of
lime deposits and ensuring the long service life of the diaphragm cell. The efficiency of the electrolysis is
P_PMA_EL_0004_SW constantly monitored by various flow meters, the addition of water depending on the sodium hydroxide
production and a dynamic level control in the storage tanks.
The systems are controlled using a modern PLC Programmable Logic Controller with a large, illuminated
display and integrated Remote Control Engineer for remote diagnosis and troubleshooting.
Electrolysis systems of type CHLORINSITU® III are especially suitable for applications in which sodium
hypochlorite solution low in chloride and chlorate is required.

4 Disinfection and Oxidation Process
4.7 Electrolysis System CHLORINSITU® V
Electrolysis systems of type CHLORINSITU® V generate ultra-pure active chlorine in a vacuum process. A
saturated solution of sodium chloride is produced in a salt dissolving tank, included in the scope of delivery
for this purpose, which is then electrolysed in a diaphragm cell. Chloride-free sodium hydroxide and
hydrogen are produced in the cathode chamber, while ultra-pure chlorine gas and dilute residual brine are
produced in the anode chamber, separated by the diaphragm from the cathode chamber. The active
chlorine produced is suctioned off through an injector (contained in the scope of delivery) and fully
dissolved as hypochlorous acid in the water being treated (through a bypass). The superchlorinated water
is then distributed throughout the various pools via one of more proportionately controllable motor-driven
ball valves. The vacuum is kept stable by a single frequency-controlled booster pump. This permits
significant savings in terms of energy. The chloride-free sodium hydroxide is stored temporarily and can be
used for pH value correction. A standard diaphragm metering pump is first used to correct the base pH (pH
6.8 – 7) of the superchlorinated water. The fine correction of the pH value is fed via additional alkali metering
pumps per circuit or point of injection. To achieve this, an external pH value controller is connected directly
to the system's control. The hydrogen produced is diluted with fresh air through an ATEX 95-approved fan
P_PMA_EL_0013_SW and discharged safely. The diluted residual brine is fully discarded. To this end, the diluted brine is seriously
diluted with softened water, neutralised by the addition of sodium hydroxide and disposed off in the sewer.
All residual chloride and chlorate are thus disposed of and are fundamentally not mixed with the process
water. Electrolysis systems of type Chlorinsitu® V can thus be compared with pure chlorine gas in terms of
their oxidation strength, chloride and chlorate content in the process water. The salt-dissolving water
comes from a softener integrated in the system, thereby preventing the formation of lime deposits and
ensuring the long service life of the diaphragm cell. The efficiency of electrolysis is constantly monitored by
various flow meters, the addition of water depending on the sodium hydroxide production and the base pH
correction.
The systems are controlled using a modern PLC with a large, illuminated display and integrated Remote
Control Engineer for remote diagnosis and troubleshooting. Chlorine metering control and pH value
correction are provided as standard via contact inputs.
Options (always customer-specific and project-managed):
(cid:2) Analogue input
(cid:2) MOD-bus or PROFIBUS®
(cid:2) Several points of injection
(cid:2) Several booster pumps are possible with differing water qualities (e.g. brine and fresh water pools)

4.8 Electrolysis System CHLORINSITU® V Plus
Electrolysis systems of type CHLORINSITU® V Plus generate ultra-pure active chlorine combined with a
sodium hypochlorite solution in a vacuum process. A saturated solution of sodium chloride is produced in
a salt dissolving tank, included in the scope of delivery for this purpose, which is then electrolysed in a
diaphragm cell. Chloride-free sodium hydroxide and hydrogen are produced in the cathode chamber, while
ultra-pure active chlorine and diluted residual brine are produced in the anode chamber, separated by the
diaphragm from the cathode chamber. The resulting ultra-pure active chlorine is further processed in two
ways. Firstly, as with CHLORINSITU® V systems, the gas is suctioned off through an injector that forms
part of the scope of delivery (vacuum system) and dissolved as hypochlorous acid in the water being
treated (via a bypass). The superchlorinated water is then distributed throughout the various pools via one
of more proportionately controllable motor-driven ball valves. The vacuum is kept stable by a single
P_PMA_EL_0012_SW frequency-controlled booster pump. This permits significant savings in terms of energy. If the complete
production output is not needed, excess active chlorine can also be combined with the sodium hydroxide
produced and then temporarily stored as sodium hypochlorite, as is the case with CHLORINSITU® III type
systems. The system thus does not have to be dimensioned according to the maximum active chlorine
demand, rather according to the average daily demand. Peaks in demand are met by the additional
metering of sodium hypochlorite from the temporary storage, which, as with hypochlorous acid, is fed
through a central injector system.
The chloride-free sodium hydroxide is stored temporarily and can be used for pH value correction. A
standard diaphragm metering pump or the addition of sodium hypochlorite is first used to correct the base
pH (pH 6.8 – 7) of the superchlorinated water. The fine correction of the pH value is fed via additional alkali
metering pumps per circuit or point of injection. To achieve this, an external pH value controller is
connected directly to the system's control. The hydrogen produced is diluted with fresh air through an
ATEX 95-approved fan and discharged safely. The diluted residual brine is fully discarded. To this end, the
diluted brine is seriously diluted with softened water, neutralised by the addition of sodium hydroxide and
disposed off in the sewer. Any residual chloride and chlorate are thus disposed of and are fundamentally

with pure chlorine gas in terms of their oxidation strength, chloride and chlorate content in the process
water. The salt-dissolving water comes from a softener integrated in the system, thereby preventing the

electrolysis is constantly monitored by various flow meters, the addition of water depending on the sodium
hydroxide production and the base pH correction.

4.9 Dulcodes UV Treatment Systems
Dulcodes UV treatment systems are used to remove bound chlorine (chloramine) and ozone in swimming
pool water treatment. The intensive UV radiation reduces the odour intensive substances that are irritating
to the eyes. The result is an improved quality of water for healthy and pleasant bathing. UV low pressure
lamps, as well as UV medium pressure lamps, are used for this purpose. Whereas systems are used with
low pressure lamps in private swimming pools or small pools (e.g. hotel pools), the UV treatment of the
swimming pool water in larger public swimming pools is almost always carried out using medium pressure
lamps due to the high circulation capacity. Although the Dulcodes UV system also improves the
microbiological quality of the water, the addition of a disinfectant with depositing effect (e.g. chlorine)
cannot be avoided.
Features of our Dulcodes UV system technology
(cid:2) High quality radiation chambers made from stainless steel (DIN 1.4404 or 1.5671) or plastic
(cid:2) Highly selective long-term and temperature-stable UVC sensors
(cid:2) Uniform radiation of the entire water flow thanks to optimised system hydraulics
(cid:2) Use of UV lamps with long lamp life time and high UV-C yield
(cid:2) System control with comprehensive monitoring and reporting functions
(cid:2) Trend display of the variation of the UV sensor signal over time
(cid:2) Use of modern electronic pre-switching units with bus technology for lamp-friendly ignition and opera-
tion
The right UV system for every swimming pool
Dulcodes W standard systems for private swimming pools or small pools (e.g. hotel pools)
(cid:2) Standard UV system with high-efficiency low pressure High Flux lamps with a guaranteed lamp service
life of 8 - 10,000 hours
Dulcodes R systems for private and public swimming pools with manual wiper
(cid:2) are particularly suitable for water which tends to form deposits on the lamp protection tubes. This range
of systems is equipped with high-efficiency low pressure Opti Flux lamps and provides a guaranteed
lamp service life of 14,000 hours.
Dulcodes M systems for public swimming pools with automatic wiper system
(cid:2) are especially suitable for treating larger volumes of water of up to 800 m3/h, with only one lamp.
Powerline medium pressure lamps have a guaranteed lamp service life of 8 - 10,000 hours.
Dulcodes K systems for swimming pools containing brine (e.g. thermal spring water, sea water)
(cid:2) The radiation chamber made of UV-resistant, high-quality PE-HD plastic is equipped with high-
efficiency low pressure High Flux lamps with a guaranteed lamp service life of 8 - 10,000 hours.

4 Disinfection and Oxidation Process
4.11 Chlorine Dioxide System Bello Zon® CDLb
The Bello Zon® CDLb chlorine dioxide system uses the chlorite/acid process. A chlorine-free chlorine
dioxide solution is generated from a sodium chlorite solution using hydrochloric acid in a batch process.
Thanks to the innovative reactor design and stepwise process flow, the production of chlorine dioxide in
this manner is exceptionally safe. Depending on type, the system can produce up to 120 g chlorine dioxide
per hour. This is then buffered in an integral or separate receiver module at a concentration of 1,000 or
2,000 mg/l. Thanks to the 60 g of chlorine dioxide buffered in the separate receiver module, these systems
need not be dimensioned according to their peak load but rather based on their mean consumption. This
drastically reduces investment costs compared with conventional systems. The ProMinent® product range
includes a wide range of metering pumps and control versions from which to choose when operating
several injection points using chlorine dioxide from a receiver module.
The innovative process produces a chlorine dioxide solution of exceptional long-term stability and achieves
excellent efficiency of over 90% in the chlorine dioxide reaction. No chlorine dioxide can escape from the
system due to the closed gas transport system, thereby guaranteeing economical, environmentally-friendly
operation with minimal use of chemicals.
The modular construction of the system means it is suitable for a range of different applications. Possible
applications of the Bello Zon® CDLb chlorine dioxide system are primarily in the prevention of Legionella
and in disinfection in the food and beverage industries. Other applications are in cooling and potable water
treatment and in swimming pool filter disinfection. Meets the high standards stipulated in the W 224 and W
624 German Association for Gas and Water (DVGW) data sheets.

4.12 Chlorine Dioxide System Bello Zon® CDVc
Bello Zon®CDVc is the convenient system for the treatment of average to large volumes of water
with chlorine dioxide.
1 to 2,000 g/h chlorine dioxide. Max. flow at 0.2 ppm ClO metering is 10,000 m3/h
2
Chlorine dioxide system for monitoring and metering chlorine dioxide and diluted chemicals. Maximum
output and safety due to special reactor concept. Bello Zon® CDVc can be easily and safely integrated
into any water treatment process.
Continuous water treatment using the chlorine dioxide system Bello Zon® CDVc can be simply and safely
integrated into any process. The special reactor concept generates chlorine dioxide safely and simply with
maximum output.
Food-compatible PVDF is used instead of PVC generally used in the industry. This results in improved
operating safety and reliability and improved purity of the chlorine dioxide generated. The central system
controller manages the precise production of the chlorine dioxide. All parameters relevant for water
treatment are recorded and logged.
The stroke lengths of ProMinent® metering pumps are monitored online. This rules out hazardous
operating statuses arising from incorrect pump stroke length adjustments.
The precise production of chlorine dioxide is managed by the central system control. Chlorine dioxide,
chlorite, pH or redox potential sensors DULCOTEST® are directly connected to the two mA inputs. The
chlorine dioxide in the treated water, as well as its main by-product chlorite, is thus monitored and
documented online. The chlorine dioxide concentrations in the water can be adjusted automatically
depending on the measurement by the integrated PID controller.
The integrated data logger documents all status messages and measured values, which the screen writer
then visualises on the clear colour display.
The systems meet all the requirements of the DVGW specifications W 224 and W 624 with regard to
construction and operation and are designed for operation with diluted chemicals Bello Zon® chlorite
(7.5 % NaClO ) and acid (9 % HCl).

* The metering figures relate to 5 bar back pressure and an ambient temperature of 20 °C. The
minimum capacity/per hour is based on the fact that when the system is operating at below 5 % of the
nominal power, continuous metering is no longer possible because of the correspondingly low
pumping frequency of the metering pumps. When systems are not operating continuously, the reactor
contents should be changed at least twice daily. The system should not, therefore, be operated below
the stated minimum capacity/day.

5.2.4 Solenoid Diaphragm Metering Pump gamma/ X
gamma/ X - the proven best-seller intelligently extended
Capacity range 1 ml/h – 45 l/h, 25 – 2 bar
The solenoid diaphragm metering pump gamma incorporates a wealth of eXcellent ingenuity! With
integrated pressure measurement, it ensures the smooth running of your metering process. The
gamma/X is ideal for all metering work involving liquid media.
The new solenoid diaphragm metering pump gamma/ X is user-friendly and has an outstandingly long
service life, just like its predecessor. An ingenious solenoid control measures the back pressure and
protects the system from overload. This technology makes a pressure sensor superfluous, meaning that
operating safety can be significantly increased: no additional parts come into contact with the feed
chemical, there are no additional sealing surfaces and no electronic components come into contact with
the feed chemical. Whether the metering volume fluctuates or hydraulic failures affect the metering process
– the gamma/ X keeps everything at your fingertips.
It independently ensures a trouble-free metering process and should the pump ever need maintenance its
service module draws attention to this.

5.4 Measuring and Control Equipment
5.4.1 Multi-Channel Multi-Parameter Measuring and Control System
DULCOMARIN® II
The multi-channel measuring and control system DULCOMARIN® II stands out thanks to the following
features:
(cid:2) 5,7", 1/4 VGA colour display for ultra-simple operation
(cid:2) Integral data logger with screen plotter: view measured data directly on the controller
(cid:2) SD card and card reader for PC included: simply transfer measured data to your PC as standard
(cid:2) Control of one to 16 drinking water systems or filtration circuits in swimming pools
(cid:2) CAN bus system: Simple to wire, subsequently extendable
(cid:2) Visualisation*: simple with embedded web server* and standard web browser
pk_5_045 (cid:2) LAN interface*: simple connection to your PC, PC network or the internet
(cid:2) Intelligent sensors: save sensor data with CANopen bus and ensure you always remain within the
optimum measuring range with auto ranging
(cid:2) Intelligent metering pumps: use CANopen bus to obtain information on operating parameters, such as:
chemical level statuses and pump capacity in the dosing range of 0.74 l/h to 1,030 l/h
(cid:2) Standby metering pump for disinfectants (automatic switchover in the event of liquid level low and pump
malfunction)
Drinking water applications (and general applications)
(cid:2) Measure and display the following measurement parameters using 0/4...20 mA with a current input
module (I-module). These values are also available on the data logger/screen plotter, the web and OPC
server:
(cid:2) Flow (as feed forward control for pH and chlorine regulation)
(cid:2) UV intensity
(cid:2) Conductivity
(cid:2) Chlorine dioxide
(cid:2) Chlorite
(cid:2) Ammonia
(cid:2) Fluoride (using D1Ca)
(cid:2) Pt100 resistance thermometer via a transducer
(cid:2) Display and control of free chlorine and total available chlorine
(cid:2) OPC server*: Simple connection to higher-level visualisation systems
*optional
Swimming pool applications
(cid:2) Combined chlorine: reliably reduced by the control output and corresponding systems
(cid:2) OPC server*: simple connection to higher-level visualisation systems
(cid:2) Regulate the pool temperature using standard temperature controllers
(cid:2) Superchlorination or night setback by contact or time-controlled by a second parameter set
(cid:2) The decentralised modular DULCOMARIN® II system is designed for use in DIN 19643-compliant
public swimming pools. The system can be configured according to requirements as the compact
system DULCOMARIN® II compact or as the decentralised modular system DULCOMARIN® II
DULCO®-Net .
The applications are defined in the identity code
Every drinking water system or every filtration circuit has a proprietary on-site calibration option for all
measured variables.
The examples shown in the following are suitable for applications in drinking water treatment and
in swimming pool technology.
What is Eco!Mode operating mode?
There is a menu in the DULCOMARIN® II for each of the measured variables controlled, in which the control
parameters (setpoint, proportional coefficient etc.) are defined. Eco!Mode permits alternative control
parameters to be enabled for every measured variable controlled via a digital input on the M module. The
alternative control parameters can be used, for instance, in setback mode to optimise the control
parameters to this operating mode or activate higher setpoints for chlorine in the event of superchlorination.
Eco!Mode remains active for as long as the digital input is set, however, it can also be activated via a timer.
This can be checked via the recorder function!

What is a web server?
A web server is a software application executed by the DULCOMARIN® II.
The web server delivers web pages with information about measurements, control, sensor calibration and
control configuration to a PC with a web browser (e.g. Microsoft® Internet Explorer).
The web server enables simple and straightforward visualisation of the DULCOMARIN® II, without special
visualisation software being required on the PC. The web server is independent of the PC's operating
system. It can be linked by Wi-Fi to an iPad, Smart phone or laptop via an access point.
The DULCOMARIN® II is connected to a PC via a LAN/Ethernet interface and this connection can be made
directly, via a network or via the internet. The cables needed for direct connection to a PC or network
connection are included in the option.
Standard commercially available network components can be used as accessories for cables, routers and
WLAN access points etc.
The same information can be accessed via the web server as is available on the DULCOMARIN® II itself,
for instance changing setpoints for all control variables, switching off the different controllers and entering
names for the pools/systems. The exceptions are the control settings and bus configuration that can only
be entered directly on the controller.
What is OPC?
OPC stands for Openness, Productivity, Collaboration (formerly OLE for Process Control) and is used to
describe a uniform software interface independent of specific manufacturers. OPC Data Access (OPC DA)
is based on Windows technology COM (Component Object Model) and DCOM (Distributed Component
Object Model). OPC XML, in contrast, is based on the internet standards XML, SOAP and HTTP.
OPC is used wherever sensors, controllers and controls supplied by different manufacturers are used to
create a common, flexible network. Without OPC, two devices would require precise knowledge about the
communication options of the other device to be able to exchange data and extensions and exchanges
would be correspondingly difficult. With OPC it is sufficient to write an OPC-compliant driver precisely once
for each device and ideally this is provided by the manufacturer. An OPC driver can be integrated without
extensive adaptation into any large control and monitoring systems.
ProMinent supplies an OPC server/driver such as this for the multi-channel measuring and control system
DULCOMARIN® II.

5.4.5 Multi-Channel Multi-Parameter Measuring and Control System
DULCOMARIN® II
The multi-channel multi-parameter measuring and control system DULCOMARIN® II DULCO® Net can, in
its top-of-the-range optional version, control 16 potable water systems/filtration circuits, i.e. the necessary
external modules for 16 tanks can be connected to and operated by the central unit. The following options
are available
Measurement and control of:
Up to 16 times:
(cid:2) pH value
(cid:2) ORP potential
(cid:2) Free chlorine
(cid:2) Combined chlorine (calculated)
(cid:2) Temperature of the sample water
Also in potable water applications (using the I module):
(cid:2) Flow (as disturbance variable for pH and chlorine control)
(cid:2) UV intensity
(cid:2) Conductivity
(cid:2) Chlorine dioxide
(cid:2) Chlorite
(cid:2) Ammonia
(cid:2) Fluoride
(cid:2) Pt100/Pt1000 resistance thermometer via a transducer
Other inputs and outputs:
Up to 16 times:
(cid:2) 3 frequency outputs for control of metering pumps for pH-correction, disinfectant and flocculent
metering
(cid:2) 3 contact inputs for processing of pump fault signal relays or container level monitoring
(cid:2) 4 freely programmable analogue outputs 0/4 … 20 mA (for pH, ORP, free chlorine, combined chlorine
or temperature)
(cid:2) 3 output relays pulse length control of the pH value, the disinfectant and minimisation of the combined
chlorine (e.g. control of a peristaltic pump and chlorine electrolysis system and UV system)
(cid:2) Control of a chlorine gas metering device
(cid:2) 3 Beta®/4 CANopen metering pumps
(cid:2) Up to 2 F modules per filter circuit are possible
The CAN bus with CANopen protocol is used as a data transfer medium between the various bus modules.
This extremely interference-proof technology was developed by Bosch and is well known from its use in
automotive applications. The maximum length of the bus backbone is 400 metres.
A T-coupler is used for connection of one of each bus module (M module, A module, P module, N module,
Beta® 4 CANopen metering pumps and CAN chlorine sensors), which connects the devices to the bus
backbone via a branching cable.
T-coupler and branching cable are part of the scope of supply of the modules.
All bus modules are supplied via the CAN bus with 24 V operating voltage (with the exception of Beta®/4
CANopen metering pumps, P modules, N modules. These require a separate mains voltage supply).
For this reason, depending on the size of the installation (number of filtration circuits to be controlled),
additional P or N modules are required that feed the operating voltage for the bus modules into the bus. The
central unit always contains a power supply (N or P module).
How many additional N or P modules do you require?

6 General information on Water Treatment
6.0.1Swimming pool technology 2015
6.1 Swimming Pool Water Treatment
The German standard DIN 19643 must be complied with when treating swimming pool water, with the
exception of swimming pools in the home (private pools). It defines the microbiological, chemical and
physical requirements (e.g. pH value, chlorine content, etc.) regarding the composition of the water. This
includes the measurement, operation and inspection processes, with the objective of providing clear, clean
and especially hygienically safe water.
Swimming pool water treatment basically consists of the following components:
(cid:2) Circulation / flow through the swimming pool (hydraulic)
(cid:2) Flocculation
(cid:2) Filtration
(cid:2) pH correction
(cid:2) Disinfection
Circulation / flow through the swimming pool
Together with the water treatment system and the circulation lines, the swimming pool represents a
circulation system in which the following must be fulfilled:
(cid:2) optimum water exchange, that is removal of impurities
(cid:2) optimum distribution of the disinfection agent
Hydraulic systems that work with floor returns have proved to be the most effective and possibly drain
100% of the water via the overflow gutter or wet decks.
Flocculation
By adding flocculents, colloidal pollutants that cannot be filtered or pollutants that have been dissolved are
transformed into a form that can be filtered. They can the be extracted from the water in the subsequent
filtering process. Flocculation must only be performed for public swimming pools / hotel pools / therapy
pools according to DIN 19643.
Filtration
Filtration has the aim of retaining any pollutants found in the water. As this represents a fundamental
component of the water treatment system, filter systems should always be purchased from specialist
suppliers.
pH value adjustment
The pH value is essentially affected by the outgassing of carbon dioxide (CO ), from the disinfectant used
2
(e.g. sodium hypochlorite) as well as by the make up water. Too low a value, i.e. acid pH values, can lead
to attacks on the materials of construction, a reduction of flocculation, increased corrosion and the
formation of nitrogen trichloride. The latter causes irritation to the mucous membranes. Too high a value,
i.e. alkali pH values, reduce the disinfecting effect of chlorine, impair flocculation, stimulate the formation
of lime scale and have an extremely negative effect of the well-being of swimming pool users. The chlorine
measurement is additionally influenced negatively. This is why the pH should lie between 6.5 and 7.6 pH.
The continual measurement of the pH value is carried out using appropriate pH sensors and controllers.
Disinfection
In accordance with DIN 19643, the disinfection of swimming pool water must only be carried out using
chlorine in the form of chlorine gas, sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite solution. Organic chlorine
products, as well as active oxygen, must not be used. Ozone, which is a mandatory specification for
therapy pools, must only be used for oxidation and must be removed completely before the water is
reintroduced into the swimming pool.
Disinfection using chlorine: The process of chlorination that has proved itself throughout the world for
many years is characterised by a safe and quick degermination speed with a high level of oxidation. It is
therefore the disinfection process of choice in swimming pool water treatment.
A decisive factor in disinfection is the concentration of free active chlorine (hypochlorous acid = HOCl).
According to DIN 19643, the concentration of chlorine in a pool should lie between 0.3 and 0.6 mg per litre.
With warm whirlpools, the concentration should lie between 0.7 and 1.0 mg / litre. As the concentration of
chlorine is continually reduced by substances that enter the water, such as, dust, cosmetics, skin particles,
bacteria and algae, a reactivation is prescribed in DIN 19643 by an automatic measuring, control and
metering system. The metering systems must be designed for metering feed rates of 2 g/m3 (indoor
swimming pools) or 10 g/m3 (outdoor swimming pools). Systems, such as this, are also recommended for
private pools. The chlorine measurement must be carried out directly via a chlorine sensor and not via the
redox voltage auxiliary parameter. This produces the following benefits:
(cid:2) quick response behaviour
(cid:2) detection of the actual concentration of chlorine present (prevents over-chlorination)
1.1.2015 Swimming pool technology 2015 135

--- Page 142 Text ---
6 General information on Water Treatment
The redox voltage is an auxiliary hygiene parameter and is used to monitor the water quality or hygienic
safety. Redox voltages of > 700 mV guarantee the quick destruction of any germs in the water.
Use of ozone: The use of chlorine in conventional water treatment can lead to undesired reaction
products, such as trihalomethanes and chloramines.
The chloramines (bound chlorine) are responsible for the typical indoor swimming pool odour and can lead
to irritation of the skin and mucous membrane. Trihalomethanes are suspected as being carcinogenic.
These problems can be drastically reduced by the use of ozone. Ozone is the strongest oxidising agent
approved for use in water treatment. It is usually added before the filtration stage and then any undesirable
substances in the water, chloramines and turbidity, are oxidised and retained in the filter. Moreover, the
content of trihalomethanes are reduced significantly below the limit values.
The use of ozone in swimming pool water treatment provides the following advantages:
(cid:2) the water does not have an unpleasant odour
(cid:2) the indoor air is pleasant and healthy
(cid:2) the clarity of the water is increased considerably by the flocculating effect of the ozone
(cid:2) no chemical by-products, as the ozone quickly decomposes to oxygen after doing its job, a desirable
factor in the water.
As ozone may have a negative impact on people's health due to outgassing, it is only allowed to be used
in water treatment systems in accordance with DIN 19643. It must be removed completely before the water
is re-introduced into the swimming pool.
Disinfection in the pool itself must be provided with chlorine. This is also recommended for domestic pools.
However, active oxygen products can also be used instead of chlorine.
Disinfection using active oxygen: Disinfection using active oxygen is only permitted in domestic pools.
The recommendations of the chemical supplier must be observed here in all cases.
Automatic measuring, control and metering units
Measuring and control units record the measured values of the sensors, process them and, for example,
control the metering pump according to the actual water parameters. Such systems offer the operator
safety and can relieve them of a lot of work at the same time.

6.2.2 DXCa Function Extensions for Hotel and Private Pools
(F Module)
The following functions are available with the basic version:
Temperature control
P-module control, for instance of a heat pump Accessory components required: Pt 100 or Pt 1000
Superchlorination
Eco mode utilises a 2nd set of control parameters and when Eco mode is activated, it is this 2nd set of
parameters which determine the control output. One way to activate Eco mode is via an inbuilt timer and if
the 2nd set of parameters are set to give a higher chlorine dose, then the Eco mode function could be used
to give timed superchlorination.
P_DC_0010_SW1
Circulation pump speed reduction (Frequency inverter by others required)
Once all DIN 19643 or individually set parameter values have been reached, the speed of the circulation
pump can be reduced. The speed reduction can be controlled in 2 ways - by timed step reduction or in
relation to the ORP value. This reduces the electric power consumption.
Timer control 0/4 - 20 mA
This enables the direct control of a frequency converter for precise adjustment of the circulation to the
current hygiene conditions. Freely programmable events: Circulation mode, backwashing, setback.

You can use the "Remove display" package to check the status of all of your pools via a wireless connection
to your iPad at any time. You also have the option of calibrating sensors for pH, redox, temperature and
chlorine from your iPad, thereby significantly simplifying calibration. 1-point calibration can also be
performed at the pool edge in the event of favourable pool hydraulics or if your plant room is difficult to
access. The last 5 test results are saved and the display of the possible potential savings with setback is
also retained.
The "PoolDiary" can be downloaded from the Apple Store to record your data and operating statuses,
enabling you to detect all key parameters and evaluate them using the program.

7 ProMinent® Chemical Resistance List
The data has been taken from relevant manufacturer´s documentation and our own tests.
Resistance of materials is also dependant on other factors, e.g. operating conditions, conditions
of surfaces etc, and so this list must be treated as an initial guide only. It cannot claim to offer any
guarantees. It should be taken into consideration in particular that usual dosing media are
compounds, and their corrosiveness cannot be deducted simply by adding the corrosiveness of
each single component. In such cases the chemical producers’ data of the material compatibility
are to be considered as a matter of prime importance for the material choice. A safety data sheet
does not give this data and therefore cannot take the place of the technical documentation on the
application.

Required final concentration g/m3, ppm
Example:
A required dose in mg/l = g/m3 = ppm
(Water flow Q max. 50 m3/h)
Pulse spacing (flow volume per pulse) of water meter 5 l.
Process fluid = sodium hypochlorite solution Na OCl with 12 % chlorine (by weight) = 120 g/kg = 150 g/l = 150 mg/ml
Selected dosing pump GALa 1005 NPB2 with 0.41 ml/per stroke volume, at max. 10800 strokes/h.
Variables: pump type, pulse spacing and concentration. The stroke rate (max. throughput l/h: pulse spacing l/pulse = 50,000 l/h : 5 l/pulse
= 10000 pulses/h) must not exceed the max. stroke frequency (10800 strokes/h) of the dosing pump.
water throughput Q max. (l/h) x stroke volume (l) 50,000 l x 0.00041 l
Feed quantity = = = 4.1 l/h
pulse spacing (l) h x 5 l
concentration (mg/ml) x stroke volume (l) 150 mg x 0.41 ml
Final dose = = = 12.3 mg/l
pulse spacing (l) ml x 5 l
= 12.3 g/m3
= 12.3 ppm chlorine Cl
