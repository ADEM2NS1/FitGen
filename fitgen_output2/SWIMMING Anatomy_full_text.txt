CHAPTER 1
THE SWIMMER IN MOTION
Swimming Anatomy is both a visual guide to the role of the musculoskeletal
system in the four competitive swim strokes and a catalog of swimming-oriented
dryland and weight-room exercises. The exercises in the text will help you
maximize your performance and gain a competitive edge. Specific examples will
help you choose exercises that target the most-used muscles for each stroke,
starts, and turns to ensure that you are getting the best results from your
program. Included are exercises that may help you prevent injuries by
strengthening key stabilizing muscles and decreasing muscle imbalances. To
help you understand how these exercises enhance performance, descriptions of
the roles that various muscles play in propelling a swimmer through the water
and guidance in using selected exercises to target those muscles are included.
This chapter features an overview of the primary muscles used in the kicking
motions and during the pull-through and recovery phases of freestyle, butterfly,
backstroke, and breaststroke. The chapter also addresses some strength and
conditioning principles and how they relate to designing a swimming-specific
dryland program. Chapters 2 through 8, organized according to major body
parts, each contain exercises with accompanying illustrations and easy-to-follow
descriptions and instructions. The anatomical illustrations that accompany the
exercises are color-coded to indicate the primary and secondary muscles and
connective tissues featured in each exercise and swimming-specific movement.

Connective tissues
Swimmers face several unique challenges that athletes in most land-based
sports do not encounter. The first challenge is the total-body nature of all four
competitive strokes, which involve movements of both the upper and lower
extremities. A coordinated effort of the musculoskeletal system is required to
keep each body part moving correctly to maximize efficiency of movement
through the water. To visualize this coordinated effort, think of the body as a
long chain and each body segment as a link in the chain. Because all the
segments are linked together, movement in one segment affects all the other
segments. This linkage, commonly referred to as the kinetic chain, allows the
power generated by the arms to be transferred through the torso to the legs. But
if a link in the chain is weak, a loss of power transfer can occur, bodily
movements can become uncoordinated, and the risk of injury can increase.
Another unique demand of swimming is that swimmers are required to create
their own base of support. Unlike land-based athletes, who have a stable surface
to push off from, you have to generate your own base of support, because most
training takes place in a fluid environment. The key to linking the movement of
the upper and lower extremities in the water, and at the same time generating a
firm base of support, is a strong and stable core. The core is best thought of as
the foundation on which the muscles of the upper and lower body are built. Even

--- Page 12 Text ---
a strong and well-designed house will eventually deteriorate if the foundation is
weak.
Without a doubt, swimming itself is the most effective way to become a better
and faster swimmer, but several components outside the water play an important
role in how you develop as a swimmer. One of those is a well-designed dryland
program based on an appreciation of the relationship between the body’s
muscular framework and stroke mechanics. While engaged in swimming,
muscles primarily function as either the mover of a body segment or a stabilizer
of a body segment. An example of a muscle functioning as a mover is the
latissimus dorsi, commonly known as the lats, moving the arm through the water
during the propulsive phase of all four competitive strokes. The near-constant
activity of the core abdominal musculature is a prime example of a group of
muscles functioning as a stabilizing mechanism. Both functions are vital to
proper stroke mechanics and efficient movement through the water. Descriptions
of the muscle recruitment patterns for each of the four strokes are categorized as
those that are active during the propulsive phase, the recovery phase, and
kicking.
Throughout the exercise descriptions in the subsequent chapters you will see a
series of five icons, one for each of the strokes and one for starts and turns. The
purpose of these icons is to identify the exercises that are particularly well suited
to a specific stroke or starts and turns.

Freestyle
As the hand enters into the water, the wrist and elbow follow and the arm is
extended to the starting position of the propulsive phase. Upward rotation of the
shoulder blade allows the swimmer to reach an elongated position in the water.
From this elongated position, the first part of the propulsive phase begins with
the catch. The initial movements are first generated by the clavicular portion of
the pectoralis major. The latissimus dorsi quickly joins in to assist the pectoralis
major. These two muscles generate a majority of the force during the underwater
pull, mostly during the second half of the pull. The wrist flexors act to hold the
wrist in a position of slight flexion for the entire duration of the propulsive
phase. At the elbow, the elbow flexors (biceps brachii and brachialis) begin to
contract at the start of the catch phase, gradually taking the elbow from full
extension into approximately 30 degrees of flexion. During the final portion of
the propulsive phase the triceps brachii acts to extend the elbow, which brings
the hand backward and upward toward the surface of the water, thus ending the
propulsive phase. The total amount of extension taking place depends on your
specific stroke mechanics and the point at which you initiate your recovery. The
deltoid and rotator cuff (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and
subscapularis) are the primary muscles active during the recovery phase,
functioning to bring the arm and hand out of the water near the hips and return
them to an overhead position for reentry into the water. The arm movements
during freestyle are reciprocal in nature, meaning that while one arm is engaged
in propulsion, the other is in the recovery process.
Several muscle groups function as stabilizers during both the propulsive phase
and the recovery phase. One of the key groups is the shoulder blade stabilizers
(pectoralis minor, rhomboid, levator scapula, middle and lower trapezius, and the
serratus anterior), which as the name implies serve to anchor or stabilize the
shoulder blade. Proper functioning of this muscle group is important because all
the propulsive forces generated by the arm and hand rely on the scapula’s having
a firm base of support. Additionally, the shoulder blade stabilizers work with the
deltoid and rotator cuff to reposition the arm during the recovery phase. The core
stabilizers (transversus abdominis, rectus abdominis, internal oblique, external
oblique, and erector spinae) are also integral to efficient stroke mechanics
because they serve as a link between the movements of the upper and lower

--- Page 14 Text ---
extremities. This link is central to coordination of the body roll that takes place
during freestyle swimming.
Like the arm movements, the kicking movements can be categorized as a
propulsive phase and a recovery phase; these are also referred to as the downbeat
and the upbeat. The propulsive phase (downbeat) begins at the hips by activation
of the iliopsoas and rectus femoris muscles. The rectus femoris also initiates
extension of the knee, which follows shortly after hip flexion begins. The
quadriceps (vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, and vastus medialis) join the
rectus femoris to help generate more forceful extension of the knee. Like the
propulsive phase, the recovery phase starts at the hips with contraction of the
gluteal muscles (primarily gluteus maximus and medius) and is quickly followed
by contraction of the hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and
semimembranosus). Both muscle groups function as hip extensors. Throughout
the entire kicking motion the foot is maintained in a plantarflexed position
secondary to activation of the gastrocnemius and soleus and pressure exerted by
the water during the downbeat portion of the kick.

--- Page 16 Text ---
Butterfly
The primary difference between freestyle and butterfly is that the arms move in
unison during butterfly whereas reciprocal movements take place with freestyle.
Because butterfly and freestyle have the same underwater pull pattern, the
muscle recruitment patterns are almost identical. As with freestyle, the
swimmer’s arms in butterfly are in an elongated position when they initiate the
propulsive underwater portion of the stroke. Muscles active during the entire
propulsive phase are the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi, which function as
the primary movers, and the wrist flexors, which act to maintain the wrist in a
neutral to slightly flexed position. The biceps brachii and brachialis are active as
the elbow moves from being fully extended at the initiation of the catch to
approximately 40 degrees of flexion during the midpart of the pull. Unlike in
freestyle, a forceful extension of the elbow is emphasized during the final
portion of the pull, resulting in greater demands being placed on the triceps
brachii. As in the freestyle stroke, both the rotator cuff and deltoid are
responsible for moving the arm during the recovery phase, but the mechanics are
somewhat different. Butterfly lacks the body roll that aids the recovery process
during freestyle; instead, an undulating movement of the torso occurs, which
brings the entire upper torso out of the water to aid in the recovery process.
Again, the shoulder blade stabilizing muscles are extremely important,
because they function to provide a firm anchor point for the propulsive forces
generated by the arms and help reposition the arms during the recovery phase of
the stroke. Although butterfly lacks the body roll present in freestyle, the core
stabilizers are still important in linking the movements of the upper and lower
extremities and have an important role in creating the undulating motion that
allows the swimmer to get the upper torso and arms out of the water during the
recovery process. The undulating movement is initiated with contraction of the
paraspinal muscles that run in multiple groups from the lower portion of the
back to the base of the skull. This contraction results in an arching of the back, at
which time the arms are moving through the recovery process. Contraction of
the abdominal muscles quickly follows, which prepares the upper body to follow
the entry of the hands into the water to initiate the propulsive phase of the stroke.
As with the arms, the muscles used in generating the kicking movements
during the butterfly kick are identical to those used during the freestyle kick; the

--- Page 17 Text ---
only difference in kick mechanics is that the legs move in unison. The propulsive
downbeat begins with contraction of the iliopsoas and rectus femoris, acting as
hip flexors. The rectus femoris also initiates knee extension, and associated
firing of the quadriceps muscle group further aids in extension of the knee. The
gluteal muscle group drives the recovery phase of the kick. Concomitant
contraction of the hamstring muscles also works to extend the hip. The foot is
maintained in a plantarflexed position through a combination of the resistance
from the water and activation of the gastrocnemius and soleus, acting as
plantarflexors. The dolphin kick that is used at the start of the race and off each
turn wall recruits a larger group of muscles than the smaller, more isolated kick
tied into the arm movements. Besides the movements generated at the hips and
knee, the dolphin kick ties in the undulating movements of the torso through
activation of the core stabilizers and the paraspinal musculature.

--- Page 18 Text ---
Backstroke
Although backstroke is unique in body positioning among the competitive
strokes, the stroke phases can still be divided into a propulsive phase that
consists of hand entry into the water, a catch component, a finishing component,
and a recovery phase. Rotation at the shoulder puts the hands in a position in
which the little finger is the first to enter the water. Combined with extension of
the elbow, the swimmer is in an elongated position to begin the underwater
propulsion phase of the stroke. A difference between backstroke and freestyle or
butterfly is that the initial catch component is dominated by the latissimus dorsi.
The pectoralis major makes a smaller contribution. Despite these differences the
latissimus dorsi and the pectoralis major are still the prime movers and are active
to some degree throughout the entire propulsive phase. Although the wrist
flexors are still an integral part of the entire propulsion phase, the wrist is
maintained in a neutral to slightly extended position. Through a combination of
pressure forces from the water and activation of the biceps brachii and
brachialis, the elbow transitions into approximately 45 degrees of flexion at the
start of the catch. By the end of the catch the elbow may be flexed as much as 90
degrees just before transitioning into the finishing component. As with the
finishing component in butterfly, more emphasis is placed on forceful extension
of the elbow, placing high demand on the triceps brachii during the final portion
of the propulsive phase.

--- Page 19 Text ---
The role of the stabilizing musculature during backstroke is similar to the role
that it plays in freestyle, largely because of the similar reciprocal arm movement
and the integration of body roll into both strokes.
The kicking motion seen in backstroke is a combination of movements that we
have seen in freestyle and butterfly kicking mechanics. Like freestyle,
backstroke uses reciprocal kicking movements. The major difference is that the
position of the swimmer causes most of the force to be generated during the
upbeat portion of the kick as opposed to the downbeat in freestyle. Backstroke
also uses the dolphin kick off the start of a race and off each wall. The muscle
recruitment patterns are the same in each case; the only change is in the direction
because of the swimmer’s body position.

--- Page 20 Text ---
Breaststroke
As with the other strokes the arm movements that take place during breaststroke
are categorized as a propulsive phase and a recovery phase. The propulsive
phase begins with the shoulders and arms in an elongated overhead position. The
first half of the underwater pull is similar to that used in freestyle and butterfly.
The clavicular portion of the pectoralis major starts the movement, and the
latissimus dorsi quickly joins in. During the second half of the pull, forceful
contractions of the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi pull the arms and hands
into the midline of the body to finish the pull. The forces generated during the
final phase are directed toward forward propulsion of the swimmer in the water
and upward propulsion of the swimmer’s torso, which is aided by contraction of
the paraspinal muscles. This movement brings the swimmer’s head and
shoulders out of the water. Flexion and rotation at the elbow bring the hands to
the midline of the body and mark the conversion into the recovery phase. To
return the hands to the starting position, the arms must be returned from their
position under the chest. This motion is carried out by recruitment of the
pectoralis major, anterior deltoid, and the long head of the biceps brachii, which
all function to flex the shoulder joint. At the same time, extension of the elbow
by the triceps brachii results in completion of the recovery phase, and the arms
return to their extended and elongated position.
As with the other strokes, the shoulder blade stabilizing musculature is crucial
to creating a firm base of support for the movements and forces generated by the
arms. Like the butterfly stroke, the breaststroke lacks a body roll component.
Even so, the core-stabilizing musculature is important in ensuring an efficient
linkage between the movement patterns of the upper and lower extremities.

--- Page 21 Text ---
Like the arm movements, the kicking mechanics can be divided into a
propulsive phase, consisting of outsweep and insweep components, and a
recovery phase. The propulsive phase begins with the feet hip-width apart and
the knees and hips in a flexed position. The outsweep is initiated with outward
rotation of the feet, which is accomplished by a combination of movements at
the hip, knee, and ankle. After the foot has been turned outward, the outer
sweeping motion is continued by extension of the hip and knee. The gluteal
musculature and the hamstrings function to extend the hip, and the rectus
femoris and quadriceps act to straighten the knee. At the transition from the
outsweep to the insweep, the knees and hip are still not completely extended, so
the respective muscle groups continue their action into the insweep component
until the knees and hip are fully extended. At the start of the insweep the legs are
in an abducted position, generating an opportunity for force production through
rapid adduction of the legs. The legs are brought back together by contraction of
the adductor muscles that run along the upper portion of the inner thigh. To
minimize drag during the final portion of the insweep, the calf muscles are
activated to bring the foot and ankle into a pointed position. Recovery is
accomplished by recruitment of the rectus femoris and iliopsoas, which serve to
flex the hip, and recruitment of the hamstrings, which serve to flex the knee.

Dryland Training Programs
Although this book is not intended to give full program design details and
guidelines, it does provide you with an understanding of how each exercise can
directly benefit you as a swimmer, which in turn can help you make better
decisions when choosing exercises for a specific program design. For example,
if your program calls for an exercise that targets the triceps, you have many to
choose from in chapter 2. We will, however, lay out some general principles and
ideas for training programs here.
You should be aware of several considerations when designing a dryland
program. The repetitive nature of swimming predisposes swimmers to
developing muscle imbalances. Muscles such as the latissimus dorsi and
pectoralis major become overdeveloped in relation to the smaller muscles that
make up the scapular stabilizers (particularly the middle and lower trapezius and
the rhomboids). In the lower extremity the quadriceps and hip flexors often
become dominant over weaker hamstrings and gluteal muscles. These muscle
imbalances not only lead to strength imbalances but also may create flexibility
and postural imbalances that can predispose you to injury and inhibit optimal
performance. So when designing a dryland program you should include a
flexibility component. Recent findings in the realm of flexibility training are that
dynamic stretches and movement patterns are an effective way to prepare for an
exercise session. Dynamic movements and stretches can be designed to
incorporate whole-body movements that can serve as an effective low-intensity
warm-up while also addressing areas of inflexibility. Further attention can be
given to tight muscle groups through static stretching at the conclusion of the
dryland program.
Careful consideration needs to be given to selecting the proper exercises. Two
concepts that can help guide exercise choice are transference and isolation.
Transference is the ability of an exercise to strengthen muscles in a manner that
will benefit a certain skill or task, in this case swimming. Transference can be
further divided into direct and indirect forms. Direct transference involves
choosing an exercise because the associated movements are directly related to a
certain component of one of the major strokes. An example would be using the
physioball prone streamline exercise (see page 136), because it directly mimics
the streamlined position that swimmers hold off their starts and walls. Indirect

--- Page 23 Text ---
transference involves choosing a certain exercise because the targeted muscle
groups are similar to those used during a phase of one of the major strokes or
choosing a certain exercise because it can transfer to a certain stroke component.
An example would be selecting the lat pull-down exercise (see page 120)
because it targets the latissimus dorsi muscle, which is a prime mover of the
arms in each of the major strokes. Isolation involves choosing an exercise that
emphasizes a certain muscle or muscle group with the goal of strengthening an
area that (1) may be underdeveloped because of muscle imbalances, (2) is
important for injury prevention, or (3) has been identified as an area of weakness
by something in the swimmer’s stroke profile.
Another choice concerns which model of dryland training to use—a
traditional weight-training program or a circuit-based program. Traditional
weight-training programs involve performing a certain number of sets and
repetitions of one or two exercises at a time and then moving on to the next set
of exercises. These programs are better reserved for swimmers near college age
and older. In contrast, circuit-training programs involve a series of exercises
performed one after another. After performing one set of an exercise, the person
moves on to the next. Circuit programs are ideal when (1) the dryland program is
being performed on a pool deck, (2) a large group of swimmers is participating
in the program at the same time, or (3) a younger group of swimmers is training.
An additional advantage of circuit programs is that they are time efficient,
allowing a large number of exercises to be completed in a short time.
To maximize your gains when performing a traditional or circuit dryland
program, give careful attention to the order in which you perform the exercises.
All programs should begin with a 10-minute warm-up period consisting of
dynamic flexibility exercises and low-intensity aerobics. Following the warm-
up, you should incorporate several injury prevention and core stabilization
exercises (choose from those in chapter 5). You should begin with total-body
exercises that combine movements of the upper and lower extremities and
progress to multijoint exercises and then isolation exercises. For example, when
training the upper extremity and shoulder girdle, you could begin with a single-
arm lawn mower (page 176), follow with a barbell flat bench press (page 70),
and end with a dumbbell biceps curl (page 28). The underlying concept is to
avoid performing the biceps curl first, which would fatigue the biceps brachii
and decrease the overall weight that you could lift with the single-arm lawn
mower exercise. A swimming analogy would be to avoid performing an
exhaustive kick set before you perform your main quality freestyle set during a
workout, because fatiguing your legs would limit your ability to get the full
benefit from the freestyle set. Following completion of the main exercises, you

--- Page 24 Text ---
can spend time on additional core stabilization exercises and static stretching and
flexibility. Note that your final program should consist of more than three
exercises; the limited number used in this case serve only as an example.
Another concept to consider is that of pushing and pulling exercises. Pushing
exercises such as push-ups and bench presses primarily work the pectoral
muscles and the triceps, whereas pulling exercises such as pull-ups and seated
rows primarily work the lats and biceps. Because these types of exercises mirror
each other in the muscle groups that they target, doing one after the other is often
beneficial in a dryland program because the alternating nature of exercises
allows one group to recover while the other is being exercised.
The next question to address is how many sets and repetitions of each exercise
you should perform. The number of repetitions is dictated by the inverse
relationship between volume and intensity. Exercise volume is equal to the total
number of repetitions performed, and intensity is a measure of the effort being
exerted when performing a given exercise. What this means is that as you
increase the number of repetitions of a given exercise, the overall intensity at
which you will be able to perform that exercise will decrease. For example, you
may be able to perform 15 dumbbell kickbacks with 25 pounds (11 kg), but if
you were to pick up a 40-pound (18 kg) dumbbell, you might be able to perform
only 8 repetitions. This relationship becomes important, depending on your
training goal. If you are trying to improve muscular endurance, you should
choose a weight that allows you to perform 15 to 20 repetitions. If your goal is to
build strength, you should use a weight that allows you to perform only 5 to 8
repetitions. Generally, when performing more repetitions (15 to 20) you should
perform two sets, whereas when you are doing fewer repetitions (5 to 8) you
should perform four or five sets. Your combination of sets and repetitions is
probably appropriate for a given exercise if the targeted muscles feel fatigued
during the last 2 to 3 repetitions of the final set. With circuit-training programs,
the number of repetitions can be either predetermined or time dependent. For
example, at one station you might perform 30 sit-ups (set number of reps) or as
many sit-ups as you can in one minute (time dependent).
Your training goal in regard to endurance versus strength will depend on
where you are in the season. The principle of periodization comes into play here.
Periodization involves breaking the season into various phases, each with a
different training goal. The underlying purpose is to prevent overtraining and
maximize performance.

Dryland Training for Young Swimmers
An important consideration in training is the age of the swimmer. Not too long
ago, strength, or resistance, training was considered inappropriate and potentially
dangerous to the young athlete. Participation in resistance training was thought
to increase the risk of injury to the growth plate, which could have negative
consequences to the child’s growth. But the safety and effectiveness of resistance
training in youth is now well documented and supported by position or policy
statements from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), American
Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), American Orthopaedic Society for Sports
Medicine (AOSSM), and the National Strength and Conditioning Association
(NSCA).
Resistance training helps young swimmers develop an enjoyable and positive
outlook by increasing their chance of success through improved performance
and decreasing their risk of injury. With a focus on fundamental fitness ability,
resistance training also prepares them for the demands of in-water practices.
Specific benefits may include improvements in muscular power, muscular
endurance, total body strength, stability around joints, body composition, and
bone mineral density, all of which can improve sport performance.
The research indicates that training-induced strength gains during
preadolescence are possible if the training program is of sufficient duration,
intensity, and volume. Current recommendations are that to produce strength
gains, young athletes should perform two or three sets of 13 to 15 repetitions for
each exercise. Training sessions should take place two to three days per week on
nonconsecutive days. Note that these gains often result from adaptations in
neuromuscular factors such as motor unit activation, recruitment, and
coordination rather than increased muscle size (hypertrophy). Younger athletes
do not have enough muscle-building hormones to cause muscle hypertrophy, but
following puberty, training-induced gains in males and females are associated
with increased muscle mass because of hormonal influences. Resistance training
will not lead to increases in height, but no data indicate that training will stunt
skeletal growth.
Before a young swimmer begins a resistance program, he or she should have
sufficient emotional maturity to accept and follow directions. The athlete should
also be able to understand the benefits and risks associated with a resistance-

--- Page 26 Text ---
training program and specific exercises. When selecting exercises keep in mind
that swimmers in a given age range can vary significantly in strength and
coordination. Exercises should be selected on an individual basis and modified if
necessary. Guidelines are provided throughout the text about exercises that may
not be suitable for young swimmers, and examples are offered about how to
modify exercises to make them more age appropriate.
When designing resistance-training programs for young athletes, a progressive
and stepwise approach in exercise prescription is recommended. This approach
stresses proper form and technique, adequate supervision of all training sessions,
and a slow, stepwise progression of exercises. Kraemer and Fleck (2005)
illustrate the importance of proper exercise selection and considerations for
athletes of various ages (table 1.1).
When considering the important role of each muscle in the mechanics of the
four swim strokes, you can see that keeping the muscles strong and well
conditioned is critical to maintaining proper technique, improving performance,
and minimizing risk of injury. Each of the following chapters includes exercises
that target various muscles in a manner that contributes directly to swim-specific
movements.

loading of each exercise; emphasize technique; introduce more
advanced exercises with little or no resistance; increase volume.

Progress to more advanced youth programs in resistance
exercise; add sport-specific components; emphasize techniques;
increase volume.

Move child to entry-level adult programs after all background
knowledge has been mastered and a basic level of training
experience has been gained.

CHAPTER 2
ARMS
The arms are extremely important in swimming because they are the link
between the primary force-generating muscles of the upper extremity, the
latissimus dorsi and pectoralis major, and the hands and forearms, which are the
anchor points that propel the swimmer through the water. Chapter 1 compared
the body to a chain that starts at the hands and extends all the way down to the
feet. The main point was that, as a swimmer moves through the water,
movements and forces are transmitted along the chain and that the chain is only
as strong as its weakest link. Of course, the arm muscles also aid in generating
the forces that propel you through the water. Those reasons should help you
understand the importance of targeting the arm muscles with a dryland program.
The elbow divides the arm into an upper and lower component. The elbow is a
hinge joint restricted to two movements, extension and flexion. Elbow extension
occurs when you straighten your arm, moving the forearm away from the upper
arm. Elbow flexion is the opposite, involving bending the forearm toward the
upper arm. The structural framework of the upper arm is the humerus. The lower
arm, typically called the forearm (figure 2.1, a-b), is supported by the radius and
ulna. These three bones are the major attachment sites and levers upon which the
muscles of the arm and forearm originate and act on. The two primary muscle
groups in the arms that are the target of the strengthening exercises in this
chapter are the elbow extensors and elbow flexors. Both contribute to the

--- Page 29 Text ---
maintenance of proper arm position and propulsion during each of the four
competitive strokes.
Figure 2.1 Forearm: (a)front and (b)back.
The primary elbow extensor is the triceps brachii (figure 2.2). Tricepsrefers to
its three heads of proximal attachment, and brachii refers to its origination in the
arm. The medial and lateral heads arise from attachment sites on the humerus,
and the long head crosses the shoulder joint and arises from the scapula

(shoulder blade). The three heads unite to form the tendon that crosses behind
the elbow joint and inserts onto the olecranon process of the ulna. The olecranon
process forms the tip of the elbow when it is bent to 90 degrees. A much smaller
triangular muscle called the anconeus assists the triceps in extending the elbow
joint and is important as an elbow stabilizer. The anconeus is intimate with the
lateral head of the triceps brachii; sometimes the fibers of the two muscles blend
into one another.
The primary elbow flexors are the biceps brachii and the brachialis (figure
2.3). As the name implies, the biceps has two heads, a long and a short, both of
which cross the shoulder joint and attach to the scapula. The two heads fuse to
form a common tendon that crosses the front of the elbow joint to attach to the
radius approximately 1.5 inches (4 cm) past the elbow. Besides being an elbow
flexor, the biceps brachii contributes to the forearm movement of supination,
which is the position when the palm is facing up. Your hands would be in this
position to carry a bowl of soup. The brachialis lies beneath the biceps brachii
and arises at the midpoint of the humerus. It attaches to the ulna just after it
passes anteriorly to (in front of) the elbow joint. A smaller muscle that at times
contributes to elbow flexion is the brachioradialis. This muscle arises from the
lateral aspect of the humerus just above the elbow and travels along the outer
part of the forearm to attach to the radius just above the wrist joint.
Despite difference in stroke mechanics, freestyle, butterfly, and backstroke
have similar activation patterns of the elbow flexors and extensors during the
pull phase. As the swimmer progresses through the catch, the elbow moves from
full extension to a position of 30 to 90 degrees of elbow flexion at midpull,
depending on the stroke and the swimmer’s mechanics. The primary muscles
responsible for generating the change in elbow position and, when necessary,
maintaining the elbow in a fixed position of flexion are the biceps brachii and
brachialis. After the elbow reaches a point of maximal flexion during the
midpull, it progresses into an extended position during the remainder of the pull
phase. This action aids in generating propulsive forces and is brought about
primarily by active recruitment of the triceps brachii. The degree of the
propulsive force generated depends on the point in the pull phase at which the
swimmer removes the hand from the water to initiate the recovery phase. In
freestyle and butterfly many coaches are now teaching their swimmers to begin
the recovery process as the hand reaches the hip, before the elbow is fully
extended. Meanwhile, backstroke mechanics involve the catch phase,
terminating with full extension of the elbow joint.

Unlike in the other strokes, during the initial portion of the pull phase of the
breaststroke the triceps brachii is the primary muscle that is active at the elbow
joint, functioning to maintain the elbow in a position near full extension. As the
hands begin to turn inward marking the transition from the outsweep to the
insweep, the muscle activation patterns at the elbow begin to change. The elbow
flexors (biceps brachii and brachialis) activate to bring the elbow into a flexed
position, a movement that aids in the generation of propulsive force. As the
swimmer transitions into the recovery phase, the recruitment pattern changes
again. The triceps brachii becomes activated to extend the elbow joint, thereby
straightening the arm and preparing the swimmer to begin the next pull phase.
As you read through the remainder of the chapter you will see that several of
the exercises involve movement at a single joint, the elbow, specifically targeting
only the elbow extensors (triceps brachii) or the elbow flexors (biceps brachii
and brachialis). These isolation exercises are best placed at the end of your
dryland program to avoid fatiguing a single muscle group early in the workout
program. A final consideration is that between the two muscle groups, the elbow

--- Page 33 Text ---
extensors are more active during the swimming movements. Therefore, you
should aim for a 2:1 ratio between exercises that target the extensors and the
flexors.
When performing upper-body exercises, be sure to set the shoulder blades for
stability before performing the exercise. For any exercise, set the core as well.
See the sidebar below for instructions about how to do this.
Setting the Shoulder Blades and the Core
Setting the shoulder blades:When performing upper-extremity exercises,
particularly those that target the shoulder joint, you should set the shoulder
blades into a stable position. The setting movement involves pinching the
shoulder blades backward and downward, as if you were trying to put your
shoulder blades in the back pockets of your pants. In the process of setting
the shoulder blades, avoid shrugging the shoulders upward because this
action shifts the focus of the exercise from the lower fibers of the trapezius
muscle to the upper fibers, which are typically already overdeveloped in
most swimmers.
Setting the core:Before performing any exercise you should make a
conscious effort to set the core. By setting the core you establish a
foundation of support upon which the exercising muscles are able to exert
their forces. You should also stabilize the low back, reducing the risk of
injury. Setting the core involves simultaneously contracting the abdominal,
low back, and gluteal muscles as if they are a corset that encircles the
abdominal region. See chapter 5, page 87, for more information about
setting the core.

Execution
1. Stand facing a pulley machine with a high cable attachment. Grasp the
handlebar at chest level using an overhand grip so that your hands are
slightly less than shoulder-width apart.
2. Holding your elbows tight at your sides, extend the forearms until the
elbows are almost locked.
3. Slowly lower the weight stack until it is 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the resting
stack and your hands are back to the start position.

Swimming Focus
Although this exercise is effective at targeting the triceps brachii and will
produce benefits across all four strokes, it is particularly valuable to
breaststrokers because it mimics the final portion of the underwater pull
performed off the start and each turn wall.
When performing the exercise you should maintain an upright posture and try
to generate the force necessary to move the weight solely by tightening your
triceps brachii. Because swimmers have a predisposition to a rounded-shoulder
posture, you can easily develop the bad habit of leaning into the cable and
cheating by bouncing your upper body at the start of each repetition.
VARIATION
Standing Double-Arm Triceps Pushdown With Rope
In the starting position your hands are at your midline. As the elbows are
extended, the hands pull the ends of the ropes outward so that when the
elbows are almost locked the hands are shoulder-width apart. The added
lateral movement isolates the lateral head of the triceps brachii.

--- Page 44 Text ---
Swimming Focus
Dumbbell kickbacks help strengthen the triceps brachii because they move the
elbow through the final 90 degrees of extension, an important range when trying
to enhance the propulsive forces generated during the final portion of the pull
during freestyle, butterfly, and especially backstroke.
Slow, controlled movements are the key to maximizing the benefits of this
exercise. The best way to enforce this is to pause for one to two seconds when
the arm is fully extended, with a focus on squeezing the triceps tight, and to
pause for one to two seconds when the arm is in the 90-degree bent-elbow
position. This approach will prevent you from generating a pendulum-like
swinging motion with the dumbbell, which is a form of cheating.
SAFETY TIP
As in swimming, your head must stay in alignment with your spine.
Lifting your head up will lead to arching of the back, and looking down
at your feet will roll your shoulders forward. Either action will take the
spine out of its safe zone and increase the potential for an exercise-
related injury.

--- Page 45 Text ---
VARIATION Dumbbell Kickback With Tubing
This variation is useful when performing dryland exercises on a pool deck
where no exercise bench is available to brace yourself. The amount of
tension initially placed on the exercise cord should be light enough to allow
you to reach the fully extended ending position. This exercise can be
modified so that both arms do the kickbacks at the same time. Be sure to
move in a slow, controlled manner and to avoid bouncing the upper body.

Execution
1. Facedown, slide both hands under your chest so that your thumbs touch
along the midline of your body at nipple level. Your toes support your
lower body.
2. Holding your body in a straight line from your ankles to the top of your
head, push your upper body upward until the elbows are almost locked.
3. Lower your body until your chest is 1 inch (2.5 cm) off the ground.

Muscles Involved
Primary:Triceps brachii, pectoralis major
Secondary:Pectoralis minor, anterior deltoid, anconeus, wrist and finger flexors
SAFETY TIP
If you are currently having shoulder pain or have a history of shoulder
problems, avoid dropping too far into the ending position because
doing so places extra stress on the shoulder joint. A good guideline to
follow is to stop when the shoulders reach neutral. Because of the
potential for increased stress on the shoulders, young swimmers who
are still working to develop their overall shoulder strength should avoid
this exercise.

--- Page 49 Text ---
Swimming Focus
Push-ups are one of the best dryland exercises because they can be performed
anywhere and do not require any equipment. Another benefit is that they place
the shoulder in what is called a closed-chain position; exercises that do this
significantly enhance the recruitment of stabilizing muscles surrounding the
shoulder joint.
While performing this or any other type of push-up, one of the main focuses
should be on maintaining the body in a straight line from the ankles to the top of
the head, just as if you were in a streamlined position in the water. A common
mistake is to take the head out of line with the rest of the spine, which will lead
to either arching of the back or dropping the hips to the ground. Maintaining
proper form, especially a straight spine, is important; therefore, those who
cannot maintain this position should modify the exercise by starting on their
knees instead of their toes.

VARIATION
Close-Grip Push-Up With Medicine Ball
To increase the complexity and difficulty of this exercise, try using a
medicine ball as the base of support. Choose a medicine ball that is
approximately half the width of your chest. Position the ball so that its
center is aligned with the middle of your chest and in line with your
nipples.

Swimming Focus
This exercise has an advantage over close-grip push-ups because using weights
as the form of resistance allows variation in the amount of stress placed on the
triceps. Therefore, it can be used by swimmers who are unable to perform close-
grip push-ups with the proper technique because of a lack of strength, as well as
by swimmers who cannot sufficiently overload their triceps with close-grip
push-ups because their triceps are so well developed.
When performing the exercise, allow the elbows to drift outward at a 45-
degree angle to help isolate the triceps.
SAFETY TIP
From an injury prevention standpoint, the wrists must be kept in a

--- Page 57 Text ---
neutral position when performing this exercise. If wrist pain occurs, try
to increase the width of the grip. The exercise will target the triceps as
long as the hand grip is less than shoulder-width. As an additional
cautionary note, if you are currently experiencing shoulder pain or
have a history of shoulder injury, modify how far you lower the bar by
not letting the elbows pass below the level of the bench.
Before adding this exercise to a program, you should be comfortable
with performing a normal bench press exercise as described in chapter
4 (page 70).

One of the primary points of emphasis when performing medicine ball chest
passes is that the throwing motion should be controlled but explosive in nature.
This technique separates it from the other exercises, which are all performed in a
slow and controlled manner. The explosive contraction helps develop power in
the triceps. Additionally, the movements performed during the exercise are
similar to those used during the open turns associated with butterfly and
breaststroke. This exercise can be a great way to learn how to absorb and
redirect momentum when performing open turns.

The Tate press focuses on the lateral heads of the triceps brachii, making it a
valuable exercise to include in a swimming dryland program.
One of the key components of this exercise is keeping the dumbbells in

Strengthening the biceps brachii and brachialis with this exercise will help with
the initial catch component of the pull phase for backstroke. This exercise also
enhances the second half of the pull phase during breaststroke. During these
portions of the various strokes, maintaining the elbow in a flexed position is
important. Loss of the flexed position by dropping the elbow during the freestyle
catch, for example, leads to dramatic losses in power. The movements performed
during this exercise also target the biceps brachii and brachialis in the same
manner as they are utilized when performing flip turns.
An easy way to cheat when performing this exercise is to initiate a rocking
motion with the upper body to generate extra momentum. You can minimize this
tendency by performing the exercise with your back flat against a wall or by
having a partner monitor your position.

The rotation of the palm inward (supination of the forearm) at the ending
position places extra emphasis on the biceps brachii and mimics the final portion
of the pull phase during breaststroke as you bring your palms in to the midline of
your body.
Because it isolates one arm from the other, the dumbbell biceps curl
overcomes a disadvantage of the barbell biceps curl. This exercise can be
performed standing or sitting, but because of the alternating arm movements you
should perform it seated to help maintain the upper torso in a fixed position.

This exercise is useful if you are having difficulty maintaining your form with
the barbell or dumbbell biceps curls or if you want to isolate the biceps brachii
and brachialis. As the name implies, the primary purpose of this exercise is to

The key is to maintain the elbow in a stabilized position against the inner thigh
and perform the exercise in a slow, controlled manner.

CHAPTER 3
SHOULDERS
The shoulder girdle is important because it serves as the link between the arms
and the trunk. It is the main rotation point about which all the arm movements
take place during each of the four strokes. The shoulder girdle is composed of
three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), scapula (shoulder blade), and humerus.
Three joints make up the shoulder girdle: the sternoclavicular joint, which is the
junction between the sternum (breastbone) and clavicle; the acromioclavicular
joint, which is made up of the scapula and clavicle; and the glenohumeral joint,
which is composed of the humerus and scapula. This chapter focuses on the
movements that take place at the glenohumeral joint, which in layman’s terms is
the shoulder joint, and the movements of the scapula. The shoulder joint is one
of the most flexible joints in the human body, as demonstrated by our ability to
place our hands anywhere in our field of vision. This wide range of motion is
possible because of the combination of six movements that occur at the shoulder
girdle. Flexion involves raising the arm forward away from the body, as if you
were raising your hand to answer a question. Extension, the reverse motion,
involves lowering the hand from a flexed position. Moving your hand away from
your body by raising it to the side is called abduction, and bringing your hand
back toward the midline of your body is called adduction. The final two
movements are rotational. External rotation involves rotation of the hand from
the midline of the body in an outward motion. Internal rotation entails rotating
your hand inward, as if you were bringing it in to rub your belly.

--- Page 85 Text ---
The muscles about the shoulder girdle can be classified into four groups:
scapular pivoters, shoulder protectors, humeral positioners, and humeral
propellers; an easy way to remember the four groups is to keep in mind the four
Ps. The scapular pivoters are the trapezius, rhomboid major, rhomboid minor,
serratus anterior, and pectoralis minor. As the name implies, these muscles are
responsible for the upward and downward pivoting motion of the shoulder blade.
They also account for the shoulder blade movements of elevation and depression
and the movements of retraction and protraction. Upward rotation of the scapula
is easily visualized if you stand behind a swimmer and watch him or her raise
the arms to the sides up over the head. Elevation is simply the movement that
occurs when you shrug your shoulders. Retraction is the movement performed
when you pinch the shoulder blades together. A combination of these movements
in unison with movement at the shoulder joint allows the wide variety of
overhead movements that we are capable of performing. To observe the
importance of these combined movements, place a hand on another person’s
shoulder blade. While you hold it in place, ask the person to lift a hand overhead.
Notice the varied movements of the shoulder blade as the arm is moved through
a variety of positions.
The trapezius is a large triangular muscle that attaches along the midline of the
body to numerous points along the spine, starting at the base of the skull and
ending at the bottom of the rib cage. From its attachment, the trapezius tapers
outward to insert onto points on the clavicle and scapula. The trapezius can be
divided into upper, middle, and lower portions. The upward portion is
responsible for elevating and upwardly rotating the scapula. The middle portion
aids in retraction, and the lower portion contributes to depression and downward
rotation. The rhomboid major and minor run from the inner border of the
shoulder blade to attachments on the spine. They work in conjunction with the
middle portion of the trapezius to pinch the shoulder blades back. The serratus
anterior is also attached along the inner border of the shoulder blade, but instead
of running toward the midline, it runs in between the shoulder blade and the rib
cage to attach along the outer surface of the first nine ribs (figure 3.1). Its two
primary responsibilities are to assist in upward rotation of the scapula and to
hold the scapula flat against the rib cage. Finally, the pectoralis minor is a small
muscle on the front part of the rib cage that goes from an attachment on ribs 2
through 3 to a landmark on the superior aspect of the shoulder blade called the
coracoid process. The pectoralis minor aids the lower fibers of the trapezius in
depressing the scapula.
Figure 3.1 Serratus anterior.

--- Page 86 Text ---
The scapular pivoters have three main areas of influence on the swimming
athlete. First, proper upward rotation of the scapula is vital to allowing the
swimmer to reach far out in front of the body when entering the hand into the
water. The more elongated the swimmer can be, the more efficient the stroke will
become. The second role is best described using the analogy that the shoulder
blade and the scapular pivoters are like the foundation of a house. Building a
spectacular house is foolish if the foundation is eventually going to crumble and
fall apart. The same goes for the shoulder girdle and the scapula. If the scapular
pivoters are weak, the rest of the kinetic chain making up the arms will
eventually deteriorate and the risk of injury will increase. As discussed in
chapter 2, when performing upper-extremity exercises, particularly those that
target the shoulder joints, you should set the shoulder blades into a stable
position. See the sidebar on page 13 for an explanation of how to set the
shoulder blades. Lastly, strengthening the posterior scapular pivoters (trapezius,
rhomboids, and serratus anterior) helps to overcome the forward rounded-
shoulder posture commonly seen in swimmers because of overdevelopment of
the latissimus dorsi.
The shoulder protector group, also known as the rotator cuff, is made up of the
supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis (figure 3.2). The
supraspinatus lies along the top part of the shoulder blade and attaches to the
head of the humerus. The primary role of the supraspinatus is to help initiate
overhead movements of the arm. The infraspinatus and teres minor arise from

--- Page 87 Text ---
the back part of the scapula and attach next to the supraspinatus on the head of
the humerus. The infraspinatus and teres minor act to rotate the shoulder
externally. The subscapularis muscle runs along the front part of the shoulder,
and like the other rotator cuff muscles, it originates on the scapula and inserts
onto the head of the humerus. As the name implies, the primary action of the
rotator cuff muscle group is to perform rotational movements at the shoulder
joint. Because of the smaller sizes of these muscles, their contribution to the
propulsive forces generated while swimming are relatively small; they do,
however, have an important role in aiding in the recovery phase of all the
strokes. Another vitally important role is their “cuff” function, which stabilizes
the shoulder joint. When considering the role of the rotator cuff in stabilizing the
shoulder joint, remember that the shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint that
resembles a golf ball sitting on a tee. The rotator cuff muscles act as dynamic
stabilizers by creating opposing forces that keep the ball centered on the tee. In
some instances an imbalance can arise amongst the rotator cuff muscles, which
inhibits their stabilizing mechanism and in turn increases the risk of injury. The
shoulder joint sacrifices stability in favor of mobility and therefore depends on
the rotator cuff muscle group to act as stabilizers and protectors.
Figure 3.2 Shoulder blade and neck.
The next major muscle group is the positioner group, which is actually only
one muscle that has three separate divisions—anterior, middle, and posterior.

--- OCR from Page 87 Image 1 ---
Posterior view

--- Page 88 Text ---
The deltoid is the shoulder cap muscle that drapes over the upper portion of the
shoulder joint (figure 3.3). The deltoid is called the positioner group because it is
the primary muscle involved in changing the position of the humerus and thus
the entire arm. The anterior portion is responsible for flexing and internally
rotating the shoulder joint. The posterior portion performs the opposite
movements, extension and external rotation. The middle portion is responsible
for lifting the arm to the side, which is the movement of abduction. The deltoid
is most active during the recovery phase. Each portion plays an important role in
moving the arm during the various stages of the recovery phase.
The final muscle group, the propellers, includes the latissimus dorsi and
pectoralis major. This name is derived from the fact that these muscles are the
primary force generators at the shoulder joint. Because of the large number of
exercises that target these muscles, their contributions to the movement of a
swimmer and associated exercises will be reviewed in the chapters covering the
chest and back.

Swimming Focus
The anterior deltoid, the primary muscle engaged throughout this exercise, is a
key player in the recovery process of butterfly, breaststroke, and especially
backstroke. During butterfly it is active during the second half of the recovery,
and during breaststroke it contributes by guiding the movements of the arm and
hand from underneath the swimmer’s chest to a fully extended and elongated
position, maximizing the efficiency of the stroke. The entire recovery phase of
backstroke, from water exit until reentry, also relies on recruitment of the
anterior deltoid. As the speed of the stroke increases and the need for rapid
recovery increases, so does the demand placed on the muscle.
You can use this exercise to build on the scapular setting motion previously
described. To do this exercise, stand with a tall, upright posture and focus on
pinching your shoulder blade backward and downward. While holding it in this
set position, perform the exercise. Have a partner monitor your movements from
behind to make sure that you do not start to shrug your shoulders.

Swimming Focus
The primary focus of this exercise is the middle deltoid, one of the key muscles
involved in the recovery phase of freestyle and butterfly. Unlike freestyle,
butterfly lacks a body roll to aid in arm recovery, leading to heavy reliance on
the deltoid muscle group, particularly the middle deltoid, to reposition the arm.
As with the forward dumbbell deltoid raise, you should emphasize a tall, upright
posture when performing this exercise. Like the forward dumbbell deltoid raise,
this exercise is a good fundamental starting point for you to practice setting your
scapula when performing upper-extremity exercises.
SAFETY TIP

--- Page 101 Text ---
To avoid overstressing the rotator cuff muscles, which are stabilizing
the shoulder joint during the exercise, do not raise the dumbbells above
shoulder height.
VARIATIONS

Overhead C
As mentioned previously, raising the arms above the level of the shoulders
while the palms are facing down can be detrimental. The addition of the C
at the end range changes the position of the shoulders in a way that allows
movement of the arms above shoulder height while alleviating the concern
of causing excessive stress to the rotator cuff. To complete the C
movement, envision each hand as the hand of a clock. Starting in the 6
o’clock position with your palms facing down, rotate both upward in a
clockwise manner to the 12 o’clock position.

Swimming Focus
This exercise targets all three portions of the deltoid (anterior, middle, and
posterior), making it an excellent all-around exercise for strengthening the
shoulders. As a result, it strengthens the recovery phase of all four strokes. For
the younger swimmer first entering the sport, this is a good exercise for the
initial development of shoulder strength, which will be important as the
swimmer progresses and increases yardage gradually. For the older swimmer,
because of the multiple movements targeted, this exercise is better suited for
building endurance at the beginning of the season or when recovering from an
injury.

To maximize the distanced gained during each stroke, you need to be able to
enter the water with your arm or arms extended and your body in an elongated
position. This exercise helps develop overhead strength and confidence in
extending your reach when entering the water.
The exercise described here is a modified version of the military press motion
performed in traditional weight lifting. The traditional version is usually
performed with the dumbbells held in the “stick ’em up” position, with the palms
rotated outward. Swimmer should avoid this position because it can place undue
stress on the shoulders and could be detrimental when combined with the stress
already present from the yardage load in the water.
SAFETY TIP
Because of the overhead nature of the exercise, young swimmers who
may not have the strength and coordination to control the movement
should not perform it. If you are currently experiencing shoulder pain
or have a recent history of it, you should follow the 90/90 rule when
performing this and other upper-extremity exercises. The 90/90 rule
states that you should avoid dropping your shoulder below 90 degrees
of abduction or flexion and avoid flexing your elbow more than 90
degrees.

Swimming Focus
This exercise can have two points of emphasis depending on the weight of the
dumbbell used. Using lighter weights allows you to concentrate more on
pinching the shoulder blades together at the end of the exercise, thus focusing on
recruiting the rhomboid major and rhomboid minor. This is an effective way to
target the rhomboids to improve their role as a dynamic stabilizer of the shoulder
blades, which in turn will increase the foundational strength of the shoulder
blades and decrease the risk of injury. As the weight increases, the emphasis
shifts from the rhomboids to the posterior deltoid along the back of the shoulder.
Targeting either of these muscle groups with this exercise will transfer to
strengthening the recovery phase of breaststroke and butterfly, as well as
contribute to the initial portion of the recovery during freestyle.

--- Page 118 Text ---
SAFETY TIP
Be sure to keep your head in line with your back when performing this
exercise. Lifting your head will lead to arching of the low back, and
dropping your head will cause rounding of the upper back. Either
motion can place unnecessary stress on the low to mid-back.

Swimming Focus
Because of the variety of shoulder positions used, this exercise targets most of
the muscles that support the shoulder blade (scapular stabilizers). Performing
this exercise will help to enhance the stability of the shoulder blade, which will
aid in transferring the forces generated by the arms to the rest of the body while
swimming and help prevent shoulder injuries.
During the exercise the focus is on squeezing the shoulder blades together and
performing small, rapid oscillatory movements with the arms. As endurance
improves and you are able to maintain good form while holding each of the three
positions for 60 seconds, you can incorporate weights as shown to make the
exercise more challenging. These muscles are small, so any weights used should
be very light (1.25 to 2.5 lb, or .55 to 1.1 kg, to start) and changes should be
made in small increments.

Muscles Involved
Primary:Serratus anterior

--- Page 129 Text ---
Swimming Focus
The sole target of this exercise is a muscle called the serratus anterior, which is
important in keeping your shoulder blade tight against your back. Weakness of
this muscle will lead to “winging” of the shoulder blade, a sign that the shoulder
blade is not being properly controlled, which in turn increases the risk of
shoulder injury. The serratus anterior is also important in rotating the shoulder
blade upward when moving overhead, which helps to extend the stroke.
The purpose of performing this exercise from the forearms instead of the
hands is to isolate the movements to the shoulder region.

The subscapularis is one of the four rotator cuff muscles, a muscle group that is
important in stabilizing the shoulder joint during repetitive upper-extremity
exercises; hence, exercises that target the subscapularis play a vital role in injury
prevention. Remember that the rotator cuff muscles all arise from the shoulder
blade, so when performing this exercise you should stabilize the shoulder blade
by pinching it down and back and holding that position during the exercise.
Placing a towel between your elbow and the side of your body as shown helps
decrease tension on some key muscles and serves as a reminder to keep the
elbow tight against your side as you rotate your arm.

External rotation isolates the infraspinatus and teres minor, two components of
the rotator cuff muscle group. These muscles are important in stabilizing the
shoulder joint during repetitive upper-extremity exercises. Because all the
strokes except backstroke emphasize internal rotation movements at the
shoulder, adding this exercise to address the strength imbalance is important.
Remember that the rotator cuff muscles all arise from the shoulder blade, so
you must stabilize the shoulder blade when performing this exercise. Pinch your
shoulder blade down and back and hold that position during the exercise. Placing
a towel between your elbow and the side of your body as shown helps decrease
tension on some key muscles and reminds you to keep your elbow tight against
your side as you rotate your arm.

so will take the isolation away from the shoulder joint. Dumbbells provide a
more consistent form of resistance than the exercise tubing.
Double-Arm External Rotation
Perform this variation by holding both arms in the starting position for the
external rotation with tubing exercise. Hold one end of an exercise tube in
each hand. In this starting position, there should be a small amount of
tension on the tubing. Next, rotate both arms outward 45 degrees while
simultaneously pinching your shoulder blades together. Hold this position
for three to four seconds and then return to the starting position.

Swimming Focus
This excellent all-around exercise targets the deltoids, rotator cuff, and triceps
brachii, all of which contribute to each of the four competitive strokes.
Recruitment of the deltoid will transfer to gains in the recovery phase of each
stroke. Strengthening the rotator cuff will help develop shoulder stability, and the
triceps brachii is a varying contributor to the propulsive phase of each stroke.
Additionally, the reaching-back movement performed during the exercise will
help develop better awareness of where the hand is in relation to the body, which
will improve swimming mechanics.
Another benefit is that the exercise places the shoulder in a closed-chain
position. Exercises that do this enhance the recruitment of stabilizing muscles
surrounding the shoulder joint. The term closed chain means that the anchor
point of the exercise, in this case the hand, is in contact with the ground.

Swimming Focus
This exercise is useful for developing strength when the hand is in an overhead
position, which will increase your confidence when you are trying to elongate
your stroke. The hand positioning with this exercise closely mimics that seen
with freestyle and butterfly. As a result this exercise can be beneficial in
developing a quick transition from the catch portion of both strokes to the
pulling portion.
When performing the bouncing motion, emphasize small, rapid movements to
focus on the deltoid and rotator cuff. This exercise builds endurance in the
scapular stabilizing and rotator cuff muscles, which aids in the prevention of
injuries. If you use larger movements, you recruit the pectoralis major and
latissimus dorsi, which is not the goal of this exercise.

CHAPTER 4
CHEST
The primary muscle of the chest, the pectoralis major, is one of two humeral
propeller muscles involved in generating most of the forces that propel a
swimmer through the water. With the aid of the shoulder girdle muscles
described in chapter 3 and the muscles of the arm described in chapter 2, the
forces generated by the pectoralis major are transmitted to the hand and forearm,
which serve as the primary force conduits through which a swimmer guides the
body through the water. Other muscles in the chest region are the pectoralis
minor and the serratus anterior.
The pectoralis major (figure 4.1 on page 62) is typically divided into two
heads: the clavicular (upper) head and the sternal (lower) head. The clavicular
portion comprises the upper portion of the pectoralis major and arises from the
anterior surface of the inner half of the clavicle. The sternal portion forms the
lower portion and arises from the anterior surface of the sternum and the
cartilage of the first six ribs. The upper and lower portions join and cross the
shoulder joint, attaching to the humerus. As the pectoralis major contracts and
pulls on the humerus, the following movements take place at the shoulder joint:
flexion, extension, adduction, and internal rotation. Flexion involves bringing
the arm from the side of the body forward. Extension, the reverse of flexion,
involves returning the arm to the side from a flexed position. Adduction involves
bringing the arm toward the midline of the body when it has been raised to the
side; this movement can be either horizontal or vertical in nature. Internal

--- Page 162 Text ---
rotation involves rotating the hand across the body so that the palm is resting on
the abdomen. For an in-depth description of the pectoralis minor and serratus
anterior, refer to the introduction to chapter 3. For this chapter it is best to think
of their role in helping to stabilize the shoulder blade and in turn the shoulder
joint as the pectoralis major acts on the humerus. A number of other muscles are
also activated during the exercises described in this chapter. The anterior deltoid
often functions to assist the pectoralis major with shoulder flexion. The
latissimus dorsi assists with shoulder extension, and the triceps brachii functions
to extend the elbow joint during the many pressing exercises that target the
pectoralis major.
As previously mentioned, the pectoralis major is one of two primary force
generators acting to propel a swimmer through the water. During freestyle and
butterfly, as the hand first enters into the water and the body is in an elongated
position, the pectoralis major initiates the pulling phase of both strokes. At this
time the upper portion of the pectoralis major is a key contributor to the
movement. As the hand moves toward its anchor point, the lower portion along
with the latissimus dorsi joins in to assist in propelling the swimmer through the
water. As the hand passes below the shoulder joint, the contribution of the upper
portion of the pectoralis major decreases and the lower portion takes over the
primary responsibility for completing the propulsive phase. As in butterfly and
freestyle, during breaststroke the upper portion of the pectoralis major is
important in initiating the propulsive phase of the stroke, beginning with an
outward sweep of the hands. As the hands transition into the lateral sweeping
motion, the pectoralis major continues as a contributor, functioning both to
adduct and to rotate the shoulder joint internally. The pectoralis major is active
during the shift from the propulsive phase to the recovery phase as the hands are
brought together at the midline of the body. During backstroke the contribution
of the pectoralis major during the initial portion of the pull depends on the
swimmer’s technique. Those with an initial deep catch depend less on the
pectoralis major and rely more on the latissimus dorsi for force generation.
Those who have a shallower catch initially have a greater contribution from the
pectoralis major. In both instances the initial contribution comes from the upper
portion of the pectoralis major. As the swimmer progresses through the pulling
motion, the lower portion takes over primary responsibility for the remainder of
the pulling phase.
Figure 4.1 Chest muscles.

--- Page 163 Text ---
An important consideration when designing a dryland program and choosing
exercises from this chapter is that the pectoralis major is usually not an area of
relative weakness in swimmers because the swimming motion activates it to a
large degree. Therefore, although using exercises that target the muscles in the
chest is important, keep in mind that one of the key goals of a dryland program
is to address muscle imbalances, not accentuate them. To avoid overemphasizing
the chest, use a 2:1 ratio of pulling exercises that emphasize the latissimus dorsi
to pushing exercises that emphasize the pectoralis major.

Swimming Focus
Push-ups are a useful addition to any dryland program because they can be
performed in almost any setting without any equipment. They are beneficial to
the swimmer as both a strengthening exercise and a stabilizing exercise. As a
strengthening exercise, push-ups primarily target the triceps brachii and
pectoralis major, two muscle groups used during the propulsive phase of every
stroke. Push-ups also target the stabilizing muscle groups (rotator cuff and
scapular stabilizers) of the shoulder joint by placing the shoulder in a closed-
chain position.
You should be sure to monitor your form when performing this exercise. A
common technique flaw is failure to hold the body in a straight line from the
ankles to the tip of the head. Two culprits leading to this technique flaw are
improper head position and weakness of the core-stabilizing musculature. Either
of these problems will cause the low back to sag or arch excessively, which will
place undue stress on your spine. If you are unable to maintain proper form,
modify the exercise by starting from the knees instead of the toes.
SAFETY TIP
Lowering the chest too far can cause extra stress on the ante-Lowering the
chest too far can cause extra stress on the anterior part of the shoulder.

Those with a shoulder injury or a history of one should avoid this
movement.
VARIATIONS
Plyometric Push-Up
Plyometric push-ups emphasize an explosive muscle contraction, in
contrast with regular push-ups, which emphasize slow, controlled
movements. The rapid, explosive movement can be useful in teaching
swimmers how to explode off the turn wall when performing open turns.
Plyometric push-ups are performed by explosively pushing your upper
body upward so that your hands leave the ground. Caution is required when
using this exercise with younger swimmers, who may not have the
coordination to catch themselves at the end of the exercise.
Kneeling Push-Up
The kneeling push-up is a good transitional variation for swimmers who are
just learning how to perform push-ups or for those who do not have the
necessary upper-body or core strength to maintain the correct positioning.

--- Page 173 Text ---
Swimming Focus
The altered body position emphasizes the clavicular (upper) portion of the
pectoralis major and the anterior deltoid muscle. The higher the feet are elevated,
the more the emphasis shifts. This altered emphasis targets the portion of the
pectoralis major that is engaged during the front half of the pulling phase for
butterfly, freestyle, and breaststroke. Be aware that the altered positioning
creates a much more challenging exercise and places extra stress on the shoulder
joint, so only those who can maintain proper form and technique with a normal
push-up should perform this exercise. A good way to transition into
incorporating this exercise is to increase the elevation of the feet incrementally.
VARIATION
Feet-Elevated Push-Up on Physioball
The physioball variation works the same muscle groups but is more

Swimming Focus
Incorporating medicine balls is an effective way to increase the difficulty of the
push-up exercise for a person who can consistently maintain proper technique
when performing regular push-ups. The unstable nature of the medicine balls
places increased demand on the shoulder and core-stabilizing musculature,
which will have to react to the hands being anchored on an unstable surface.
Additionally, the altered hand position allows a larger available range of motion
when performing the exercise, which will strengthen the muscles through a
larger range.

--- Page 179 Text ---
VARIATION
Medicine Ball Push-Up With Staggered Hand Placement
The staggered hand placement (one hand on a medicine ball and one hand
on the floor) creates a challenging scenario because each hand is in a
different position. The challenge is similar to that encountered when
swimming freestyle and backstroke. The altered hand position places more
strengthening emphasis on the hand on the medicine ball. Additionally, the
added rotation of the trunk alters the demands placed on the abdominal core
musculature.

Swimming Focus
The bench press is the primary exercise used in almost all athletic realms to
strengthen the pectoralis major. This exercise allows you to strengthen the
pectoralis major through a wide range of motion, which will carry over to
strengthening the pull phase of freestyle, butterfly, and breaststroke. Although it
uses the same muscle groups as push-ups do, the resistance can be varied,
overcoming one of the disadvantages of push-ups. Lowering the bar to the
middle of the chest (nipple line) is important; doing this helps bring the elbows
down along the side of the body. Lowering the bar to a point on the upper chest
(like the clavicles) keeps the elbows high, placing undo stress on the anterior
part of the shoulder.
VARIATION
Dumbbell Flat Bench Press
Using dumbbells allows the hands to move independently of each other,
creating an exercise that more closely relates to the independent demands
encountered while swimming. Using dumbbells also allows the arms to be

isolated from one another, which prevents a stronger arm from
compensating for a weaker arm.

Swimming Focus
This exercise has the same benefits as the dumbbell variation of the barbell flat
bench press but has the added benefit of requiring you to activate additional
muscle groups to maintain body position. Having only the feet and shoulders as
contact points supporting the body places high demands on the stabilizing
muscles of both the torso and the hips. Because of the unstable nature of the
physioball, the stabilizing muscles that are functioning to maintain body position
are constantly being challenged.
While performing the exercise, the hips and torso should be held in a position
in which a straight line can be drawn from the knees, through the hips and torso,
to the top of the head. Maintaining this body position mimics the demands
encountered while holding a streamlined position. As with other exercises,
excessive arching or rounding of the low back increases the risk of injury.
SAFETY TIP
Young swimmers should not perform this exercise until they have

Swimming Focus
The elevated upper-body position places the focus of this exercise on the
clavicular (upper) portion of the pectoralis major and the anterior and middle
deltoids. The advantage of isolating the upper portion of the pectoralis major is
that it is active during the initial portion of the pull phase during freestyle,
butterfly, and breaststroke. Targeted strengthening of the muscle in this position
will not only enhance the strength of the initial portion of the pull but also
improve your confidence in elongating your stroke.
SAFETY TIP
Keys to protecting the shoulder joint and avoiding injury include
lowering the bar to a point at the middle of the chest (nipple line) and
not allowing the hands and barbell to shift behind the shoulders when
driving the bar upward.
VARIATION
Dumbbell Incline Bench Press

Swimming Focus
This exercise targets both the pectoralis major and the triceps brachii, which will
carry over to benefit all four strokes, contributing primarily to the pull phase.
The exercise will be particularly useful to breaststrokers because it closely
mimics the final portion of the underwater pull performed off the start and each
turn wall. Depending on the angling of the torso, the focus of the exercise can be
switched from the pectoralis major to the triceps brachii. Leaning forward will
focus more on the pectoralis major, whereas maintaining a vertical, upright
orientation of the chest will emphasize the triceps brachii.
SAFETY TIP
When performing this exercise, do not let the shoulders drop below the
elbows. Lower your body only until you feel a stretch in the front part
of the shoulders. This exercise is best reserved for the early part of the

--- Page 203 Text ---
season when yardage demands are low and the shoulders can handle
the extra stress of the exercise. Young swimmer should avoid this
exercise.

This exercise is one of the few that targets both the pectoralis major and
latissimus dorsi in an explosive manner. It strengthens the initial portion of the
pull phase for all four strokes, which is useful in making a quick transition from
hand entry to a high-elbow position. Breaststrokers will find this exercise
particularly beneficial because it is similar to the underwater pull that is
performed off the start and each turn wall.
Keys to getting maximum benefit from the exercise begin with initiating the
throw with the arms in an elongated position. This positioning will help ensure
that the exercise is initiated with a tall, upright posture. A second key is making
an explosive yet controlled throw and continuing the throw until you release the
ball at the hips.

Similar to the standing double-arm medicine ball throw down, this exercise
targets both the pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi in an explosive manner.
The primary difference between the two exercises is the release point of the
medicine ball. In this exercise the medicine ball is released as the hands pass the
shoulders. The main benefit of the exercise is that it strengthens both the
pectoralis major and latissimus dorsi in an overhead position. This benefit will
enhance your confidence and strength during the initial portion of the pull phase
for all strokes.
A key to maximizing the benefits of the exercise is to initiate the throw with
the arms in an elongated position. You can accentuate this positioning by
catching the medicine ball passed to you by your partner, decelerating the ball,
and then quickly reversing its direction to initiate the throwing motion.

Swimming Focus
The wheelbarrow exercise focuses on several areas that are beneficial to the
swimmer. As a strengthening exercise it targets the pectoralis major and triceps
brachii, which are vital contributors to the portion of the pulling phase of all four
strokes. The exercise also requires activation of the shoulder-, core-, and hip-
stabilizing musculature, which will help with injury prevention and maintenance
of a streamlined body position in the water. One of the biggest advantages of the
wheelbarrow exercise is that it builds mental toughness.
The emphasis should be on maintaining the body in a straight line from the
ankles to the tip of the head. Flaws encountered when performing this exercise
include not holding the head in line with the rest of the body and allowing
excessive arching or sagging of the back. Both alterations in body position
increase the risk of injury. To transition into performing the exercise, first
attempt to hold the wheelbarrow position without moving your hands. When you
are able to hold this position with good technique for 60 seconds, you can begin
to start the walking motion with your hands.

CHAPTER 5
ABDOMEN
To move your body efficiently through the water, a coordinated movement of
the arms and legs must occur. The key to this coordinated movement is a strong
core, of which the muscles of the abdominal wall are a primary component.
Besides helping to link the movement of the upper and lower body, the
abdominal muscles assist with the body-rolling movements that take place
during freestyle and backstroke and are responsible for the undulating
movements of the torso that take place during butterfly, breaststroke, and
underwater dolphin kicking.
The abdominal wall is composed of four paired muscles that extend from the
rib cage to the pelvis. The muscles can be divided into two groups—a single
anterior group and two lateral groups that mirror each other. The anterior group
contains only one paired muscle, the rectus abdominis, which is divided into a
right and left half by the midline of the body. The two lateral groups each
contain a side of the remaining three paired muscles—the external oblique,
internal oblique, and transversus abdominis (figure 5.1). In human motion and
athletics, the abdominal muscles serve two primary functions: (1) movement,

--- Page 223 Text ---
specifically forward trunk flexion (curling the trunk forward), lateral trunk
flexion (bending to the side), and trunk rotation; and (2) stabilization of the low
back and trunk. The motions mentioned earlier result from the coordinated
activation of multiple muscle groups or the activation of a single muscle group.
Figure 5.1 Abdominal muscles.
The rectus abdominis, popularly known as the six pack, attaches superiorly to
the sternum and the surrounding cartilage of ribs 5 through 7. The fibers then run
vertically to attach to the middle of the pelvis at the pubic symphysis and pubic
crest. The six-pack appearance results because the muscle is divided by and
encased in a sheath of tissue called a fascia. The visible line running along the
midline of the body dividing the muscle in two halves is known as the linea alba.
Contraction of the upper fibers of the rectus abdominis curls the upper trunk
downward, whereas contraction of the lower fibers pulls the pelvis upward
toward the chest. Combined contraction of both the upper and lower fibers rolls
the trunk into a ball.
The muscles of the two lateral groups are arranged into three layers. The
external oblique forms the most superficial layer. From its attachment on the
external surface of ribs 5 through 12, the fibers run obliquely (diagonally) to
attach at the midline of the body along the linea alba and pelvis. If you were to
think of your fingers as the fibers of this muscle, the fibers would run in the
same direction as your fingers do when you put your hand into the front pocket
of a pair of pants. Unilateral (single-sided) contraction of the muscle results in
trunk rotation to the opposite side, meaning that contraction of the right external
oblique rotates the trunk to the left. Bilateral contraction results in trunk flexion.
The next layer is formed by the internal oblique. The orientation of its fibers is

--- OCR from Page 223 Image 1 ---
Extemal
oblique

--- Page 224 Text ---
perpendicular to those of the external oblique. This muscle originates from the
upper part of the pelvis and from a structure known as the thoracolumbar fascia,
which is a broad band of dense connective tissue that attaches to the spine in the
upper-and lower-back region. From its posterior attachment, the internal oblique
wraps around to the front of the abdomen, inserting at the linea alba and pubis.
Unilateral contraction rotates the trunk to the same side, and bilateral contraction
leads to trunk flexion. The deepest of the three layers is formed by the
transversus abdominis, so named because the muscle fibers run transversely
(horizontally) across the abdomen. The transversus abdominis arises from the
internal surface of the cartilage of ribs 5 through 12, the upper part of pelvis, and
the thoracolumbar fascia. The muscle joins with the internal oblique to attach
along the midline of the body at the linea alba and pubis. Contraction of the
transversus abdominis does not result in significant trunk motion, but it does join
the other muscles of the lateral group to function as a core stabilizer. An analogy
that often helps people grasp the core-stabilizing function of the muscles of the
lateral group is to think of them as a corset that, when tightened, holds the core
in a stabilized position.
Note that other muscles, including the serratus anterior and hip flexors, can be
recruited along with the abdominal muscles when many of the exercises in this
chapter are performed. The serratus anterior commonly functions as a stabilizer
of the scapula, as described in chapter 3, but it is also activated during many of
the exercises that target the external and internal obliques. The two primary hip
flexors are the rectus femoris and the iliopsoas. As described in chapter 7, these
muscles can either flex the hip or flex the lower trunk, depending on whether the
lower extremity or trunk is stabilized.
The role of the core abdominal muscles in swimming can be easily broken
down according to their roles as trunk flexors, trunk rotators, and trunk
stabilizers. Through their ability to flex the trunk, the rectus abdominis, external
oblique, and internal oblique all play important roles in the movements that take
place during swimming. For example, flexion of the trunk during flip turns is
initiated by the upper fibers of the rectus abdominis, sustained by the lower
fibers of the rectus abdominis, and helped to completion by both obliques. The
trunk flexors are also important contributors to the wavelike, or undulating, body
roll that takes place during butterfly, breaststroke, and underwater dolphin
kicking. Besides contributing to flexion of the trunk, the obliques are responsible
for trunk rotational movements. Strong obliques are vital to enhancing the speed
of open turns performed during butterfly and breaststroke. The obliques are
active during the body-rolling movements that take place during freestyle and
backstroke, functioning to link the movements of the arms with the movements

--- Page 225 Text ---
of the hips and legs. As previously mentioned, through their ability to function
like a corset, the abdominal muscles are central to stabilizing the trunk. Trunk
stability is one of the keys to efficient movement through the water, because it
ensures a firm base of support upon which the arms and legs can generate their
propulsive forces.
When incorporating abdominal strengthening exercises into the dryland
program, you must understand the importance of focusing on correct technique.
The focal point of correct technique begins with the conscious recruitment of the
abdominal muscles, often referred to as setting, or locking in, the core, as
described in the sidebar on page 13 of chapter 2. Setting the core first involves
using the abdominal muscles to control the positioning of the hips and low back.
This is best done by lying on the back, as pictured in the starting position for the
first exercise of this chapter, the hollow hold. In this position, contraction of the
abdominal muscles rolls the hips backward, pressing the low back against the
floor. Conversely, contraction of the hip flexors rolls the hips forward, causing
the low back to arch. After becoming comfortable with rolling the hips forward
and backward, attention should be switched to holding the low back and pelvis
in a neutral, fixed position. A useful approach to maintaining this neutral
position is to visualize all the abdominal muscles as a corset and to focus
consciously on contracting the abdominal muscles in this manner. You should
perform the process of setting the core at the start of every abdominal exercise,
and it should remain the underlying focus while you execute the entire exercise.
The most common indicators that you are not setting the core are excessive
arching of the low back and, if you are performing an exercise while facing the
ground, excessive rounding of the low back and the hips rising toward the
ceiling. Either of these compensatory movements is an indication that you are
relying on your stronger hip flexors (rectus femoris and iliopsoas) to hold the
body position instead of your abdominal musculature.

Swimming Focus
This exercise is a good way to learn how to use your abdominal musculature to
position the hips for correct technique and to stabilize the low back. In the
starting position, you can experiment with contracting and relaxing your
abdominal musculature to roll your hips forward and backward. Practicing these
movements will help you gain a feel for the positioning of your hips. Gaining
this feel will help you detect when you haven fallen out of the proper positioning
for the exercise. A partner can monitor your positioning by testing whether he or
she can slide a hand under your low back. If your partner can slide a whole hand
under your low back, then you have fallen out of the proper position. When you
lift your shoulders off the ground, look down your arms and past your knees to
increase recruitment of the upper fibers of the rectus abdominis.
Direct benefits include strengthening of the core musculature, which will
carry over to a tighter streamline and a reduction in the risk of injury. By
targeting the upper fibers of the rectus abdominis, this exercise helps with the
initiation of trunk flexion during freestyle and backstroke flip turns.

Swimming Focus
This exercise is a good way to transition from the hollow hold to a more
challenging exercise when the primary focus is engaging the abdominal
musculature to stabilize the low back. Again, monitoring the positioning of the
hips and low back is important when performing the exercise. In both the
starting and the ending position, the body should be held in a straight line from
the ankles all the way to the tip of the head. If the hips begin to drop, the
swimmer should be cued to focus on tightening the abdominal musculature.
Monitoring the position of the head is also important because its position will
indirectly affect the positioning of the low back. If the head is out of alignment
with the rest of the body, holding proper body positioning will be much more
challenging. As you become more proficient at performing the exercise,
gradually increase the amount of time that you spend in each position. The goal
is to reach 30 to 45 seconds.
This is an excellent all-around exercise for learning how to engage the
abdominal muscles in a manner that will carry over to better maintenance of
proper hip and low back positioning during all four strokes and when
streamlining off starts and turns.

This is a good exercise to transition to after mastering the hollow hold. As with
the hollow hold, the main emphasis should be on keeping the low back in a
stable and fixed position. If the low back begins to arch, the abdominal
musculature is no longer holding the low back in a stable and fixed position and
is being overpowered by the hip flexors. Incorporation of the flutter-kicking
motion makes this exercise particularly useful to freestyle and backstroke
swimmers.
To avoid relying on the hands to hold the upper body in its curled position,
perform this exercise by holding your hands 1 inch (2.5 cm) off the ground.

Streamlined Flutter Kicks
A variation is to hold your arms in an overhead streamlined position. This

Because the movement begins with the back in an extended position, this
exercise strengthens the rectus abdominis through a range of motion not targeted
by any of the other exercises listed in this chapter. This feature makes it a
valuable exercise for both breaststroke and butterfly swimmers because it
contributes to the undulating body movements that occur during both of these
strokes.
While performing the exercise, keep your fingers loose behind your head and
do not pull your head forward with your hands. Additionally, the positioning of
your body on the physioball should remain constant during the entire exercise. If
your hips roll back, your shoulders will rise and you will lose the isolation of the
abdominal muscles. An easy way to prevent this from happening is to focus on
keeping the thighs parallel to the ground.

Swimming Focus
Use of the pulley machine allows this exercise to be performed with variable
resistance. As a result, the focus of the exercise can be shifted from endurance to
strength simply by altering the weight and number of repetitions performed. The
variable resistance offers an advantage when compared with most of the
exercises in this chapter, which depend primarily on body weight. The motion
performed during the exercise closely mimics the motion performed during a flip
turn, but because of the wide range of motion through which the abdominal
muscles are targeted and the variable resistance, this exercise is beneficial across
all four strokes.
To gain maximal benefit when performing the exercise, emphasize a curling
motion, beginning with the upper torso and continuing all the way down to the
waistline. When performing the exercise, resist the temptation to pull downward
with the hands. Doing this shifts the focus away from the abdominal muscles and
places unnecessary stress on the joints and muscles of the neck.

Swimming Focus
It is easy to visualize how this exercise can contribute directly to strengthening
the core stabilizers as they are used while swimming backstroke. The addition of
trunk rotational movements similar to those performed while swimming
backstroke emphasizes the internal and external obliques. By moving both arms
in unison and holding a streamlined position, the focus of the exercise shifts to
strengthening the core muscles as they contribute to maintaining a streamline
during both starts and turns.
While performing this exercise, the main focus must be placed on (1)
maintaining the set abdominal position during the entire exercise and (2)
performing the arm and trunk movements in a slow, controlled manner.

Swimming Focus
The main focus of this exercise is the internal and external obliques, which are
extremely important in linking the movements of the arms and legs during
freestyle and backstroke, especially when you are in an elongated position. The
upper-trunk rotational movements are similar to those performed during open
turns for both butterfly and breaststroke, so this exercise can also be used to
improve the speed at which you can complete a turn and get off the wall.
To keep the focus of the exercise on the abdominal musculature, hold the
medicine ball close to the chest. If you hold the ball away from your chest and
emphasize touching it to the ground, you may compensate by using the shoulder
muscles instead of the abdominal muscles.

Swimming Focus
Because it starts with the arms and trunk in an elongated and stretched position,
this exercise helps swimmers develop confidence and strength in their stroke
during the initial portion of the pulling phase of all four strokes. Another key to
this exercise is that the actions performed recruit the latissimus dorsi and
pectoralis major, which helps to link their activation with that of the involved
abdominal muscles. This coordination in muscle activation helps swimmers
generate more power with their arm movements by linking them to the core.
When performing the exercise, the head should follow the movements of the
hands. This action links the movements of the arms to the movements of the
torso, which in turn targets the abdominal muscles. Not doing this poses the risk
that the movements will be performed predominantly with the arms rather than
the trunk, thus negating most of the benefits of the exercise.

This core-strengthening exercise is particularly useful for breaststrokers. It can
help them develop confidence when the body is in an elongated position at the
start of the pulling phase. Additionally, the exercise targets the abdominal
muscles in a way that will carry over to strengthening the undulating body
movements that occur during breaststroke and butterfly.
To get the maximum benefit out of performing this exercise, you must

--- Page 278 Text ---
stabilize the spine in a neutral position for the entire time. Dropping the hips and
arching the back is a sign that this control has been lost. The difficulty of the
exercise can be modified by altering the starting forearm placement on the
physioball. If the starting position of the hand and forearms is lower on the ball
and closer to the floor, the exercise becomes more difficult because you will be
able to roll the ball farther away from the body.

The rotational movements performed during the exercise are useful for
strengthening the oblique muscles, which in turn will help to strengthen the
linkage between the legs and arms during freestyle and backstroke. This exercise
also improves awareness and control of hip position, which can help a swimmer
who is having trouble keeping the hips elevated when swimming backstroke.
The degree of rotational movement performed during the exercise depends on
the ability to keep the hips straight, meaning that the shoulders should be rotated
until the hip position can no longer be controlled. When just learning how to
perform the exercise or for those with weak core musculature, the best approach
is to keep the rotational movements small and focus initially on maintaining the
bridge position for a 60-second hold. As proficiency with the exercise increases,
the focus can be shifted toward increasing the rotational movements of the upper
body and performing a set number of repetitions.

Swimming Focus
For many swimmers, simply attaining the starting position for this exercise will
be a challenge. The initial emphasis should be on holding the body in a straight
line from the feet to the tip of the head for a 60-second duration. Developing the
strength to hold this position will greatly enhance your ability to hold a tight
streamlined position in the water. Incorporating the trunk-curling motion with
hip flexion shifts the focus of this exercise from a general stabilizing exercise to
one that targets the rectus abdominis and the hip flexors (rectus femoris and
iliopsoas). As a result of this combined strengthening, this exercise strengthens
the relationship between the core musculature and the hip flexors, which
enhances the hip-rolling movements that take place in breaststroke and butterfly.

CHAPTER 6
BACK
The latissimus dorsi and the erector spinae muscle group are the two primary
targets of the exercises in this chapter (figure 6.1 on page 114). The latissimus
dorsi, a humeral propeller, is the primary workhorse of the upper extremity,
responsible for generating most of the forces that propel a swimmer through the
water. The latissimus dorsi works in unison with the shoulder girdle (chapter 3)
and arm muscles (chapter 2) to transmit forces to the hand and forearm, which
allows the swimmer to guide the body through the water with each stroke. As the
name implies, the erector spinae muscle group is responsible for extension of the
spine, which holds the body erect and, in swimming, maintains proper horizontal
body positioning in the water.
The latissimus dorsi is a triangular flat muscle that arises from the lower
thoracic vertebra, the thoracolumbar fascia, and the posterior iliac crest (back
part of the hip bone). Recall from chapter 5 that several of the core muscles also
attach to the thoracolumbar fascia, thus dynamically linking the latissimus dorsi
to the core stabilizers. From the attachments that form the base triangle, the
muscle tapers to a tendon at the tip of the triangle, which attaches to the upper
humerus. Through its attachment on the humerus, the latissimus dorsi contracts
to generate the following movements at the shoulder: extension, adduction, and
internal rotation. Extension is the movement of bringing the hand and arm down

--- Page 292 Text ---
from a forward raised position or, if the arm is already at the side of the body, the
movement of reaching the hand behind the body—think of a runner in a relay
race reaching behind to grab the baton. Adduction is the movement of bringing
the arm down to the side from an overhead position, as when performing a
jumping jack. Internal rotation involves rotating the hand inward toward the
midline of the body. As you read through the exercises, you will find that several
muscles are commonly activated in conjunction with activation of the latissimus
dorsi. The lower and middle fibers of the trapezius and the rhomboid major and
minor often assist by aiding in retraction of the shoulder blade. The teres major
aids with shoulder extension, and the biceps brachii and brachialis flex the elbow
joint.
The erector spinae muscle group is composed of a series of muscles separated
into three columns that run vertically along the spine. The iliocostalis forms the
most lateral column, the longissimus forms the middle column, and the spinalis
forms the most medial column. The columns share a common origin spanning
the posterior iliac crest, the posterior sacrum, and a portion of the lumbar
vertebra. The superior attachments are variable, depending on the column. When
the erector spinae groups on each side of the spine contract in unison, extension
of the trunk occurs. When only one muscle group contracts, lateral flexion (side
bending) and rotation of the trunk occur to the side of the muscle group that is
contracting. The gluteus maximus and the hamstring muscle group (biceps
femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus) are commonly activated in
unison with the erector spinae because they extend the hip, a movement that
commonly takes place in conjunction with extension of the spine; their anatomy
will be discussed in chapter 7.
Figure 6.1 Back muscles.

--- Page 293 Text ---
Although the pectoralis major and the latissimus dorsi are both defined as
humeral propellers and together produce most of the upper-extremity propulsive
forces responsible for driving a swimmer through the water, of the two, the
latissimus dorsi is the prime mover. During freestyle, butterfly, and breaststroke,
the latissimus dorsi begins contributing shortly after hand entry at the initiation
of the propulsive portion of the pulling phase. During backstroke, no delay
occurs in the activation of the latissimus dorsi. In all four stokes the latissimus
dorsi remains active from its point of recruitment during the propulsive phase
until the initiation of the recovery phase. In butterfly, it contributes to the
initiation of the recovery phase. For every exercise that primarily targets the lats,
extra emphasis should be placed on pinching the shoulder blades together in the
ending position. Doing this increases the recruitment of the musculature that
stabilizes the shoulder blades, further increasing the benefit of the exercise.
The erector spinae muscle group is extremely important in maintaining proper
horizontal body alignment in the water, especially during backstroke. Whenever
a swimmer has difficulty holding a tight streamline in the water or allows the
hips to drop while swimming backstroke, the erector spinae should be near the
top of the list of suspected areas of weakness. The erector spinae muscle group
produces the extension of the spine that takes place with the undulating body

Rhombeid major

--- Page 294 Text ---
movements performed with underwater dolphin kicking, butterfly, and
breaststroke. The erector spinae muscle group also plays a vital role in the
starting motion of all four strokes. During starts performed from the blocks, it is
one of the primary muscle groups responsible for creating the streamlined body
position. During backstroke starts, contraction of the erector spinae leads to the
arching motion that allows the swimmer to get off the wall and into the water
quickly.

Swimming Focus
Chin-ups are a great addition to any dryland program because they can be done
wherever a chin-up or pull-up bar is available. In comparison with the hand
positioning for pull-ups, the hand placement for chin-ups emphasizes the elbow
flexors (biceps brachii and brachialis). By targeting both the latissimus dorsi and
the elbow flexors, this exercise benefits all swimmers by strengthening the
pulling phase of their strokes. Because chin-ups are generally a challenging
exercise for most swimmers, they are useful for building mental toughness. To
help you reach your goal number of repetitions, a partner can assist by
supporting your feet.
Make sure that your body movements are slow and controlled during the
exercise. Excessive jerking and swinging of the legs is a form of cheating.

--- Page 300 Text ---
SAFETY TIP
When returning to the starting position, lower your body in a controlled
manner to avoid placing extra stress on the shoulders, which can occur if
you allow your body to drop down quickly. Also, avoid hanging in the

Like chin-ups, pull-ups are easy to add to a dryland program because they can be
performed almost anywhere. The hand positioning, opposite that used in chin-
ups (palms facing away instead of toward the body), decreases the emphasis on
the elbow flexors but is more similar to the hand positioning used during the four
competitive strokes. This exercise strengthens the muscles responsible for the
initial portion of the pull phase by targeting the latissimus dorsi with the arms in
an overhead and elongated position. The difficult nature of the exercise builds
mental toughness. To help you reach your goal number of repetitions, a partner
can assist by supporting your feet.

The lat pull-down is a good all-around exercise for targeting the latissimus dorsi
and has a beneficial effect on the pulling phase of all four competitive strokes.
Although the body movements performed are similar to those used in pull-ups,
lat pull-downs offer the advantage that the resistance is variable and does not
depend on body weight. When performing the exercise, focus on keeping your
elbows high to mimic more closely the catch position of the pull phase.
Although arching your back slightly when bringing the bar down to your chest is
OK, avoid leaning backward and using your body weight instead of your
latissimus dorsi to pull the weight down.
SAFETY TIP
Perform the exercise as illustrated. The more traditional lat pull-down,
in which the bar is brought behind the head to the base of the neck,
places extra stress on the shoulder joints.

Swimming Focus
Similar to the lat pull-down, the standing straight-arm pull-down is beneficial for
swimmers because the start of the exercise targets the latissimus dorsi in an
overhead elongated position, thus strengthening the initial portion of the pulling
phase. An added benefit of the straight-arm pull-down is that it takes the arms
through a much larger range of motion than do chin-ups, pull-ups, and lat pull-
downs. By helping to strengthen the muscles through the entire pulling motion,
the exercise is more specific to the demands of swimming.
A key to isolating the latissimus dorsi during the exercise is to maintain the
elbows in a fixed position and to keep the elbows high during the entire motion.
Allowing the elbow position to change during the exercise shifts the demands of
the exercise from the lats to the triceps brachii. Holding the torso still is also
important. Bobbing or dipping of the torso is a form of cheating.

This exercise builds strength in the latissimus dorsi. It can be particularly
beneficial to the breaststroker who wants to increase the strength of the latter
half of the pull when the hands are brought together in the midline of the body.
By targeting the secondary muscles, particularly the scapular retractors, the
exercise enhances the scapular retraction that takes place during the final portion
of the breaststroke pulling phase as well as the scapular retraction that is vital to
an efficient recovery phase during butterfly. Strengthening of the scapular
stabilizers also helps to stabilize the scapula, which generates a stronger base of
support for the entire shoulder girdle.
Altering the weight used during the exercise shifts the emphasis to different
muscles. Lighter weights allow a greater degree of scapular retraction, thus
placing more focus on the rhomboid major, rhomboid minor, and trapezius. In
contrast, increasing the weight places more demand on the latissimus dorsi at the
sacrifice of decreasing the amount of scapular retraction that is performed. To
isolate the muscles of the shoulder girdle and arms, avoid leaning backward
while performing the exercise.

Similar to the seated row, this exercise is valuable for the breaststroker who
wants to strengthen the second half of the pull. It is also a good general
strengthening exercise that any swimmer can use to develop the strength of the
latissimus dorsi.
When performing the exercise with a lighter weight, more emphasis is placed
on the scapular retracting muscles. Using greater weight shifts the focus to the
latissimus dorsi. Head positioning during this exercise is important. As with
swimming, looking upward drops the hips and arches the low back, whereas
looking downward toward the feet rolls the shoulders forward. To maintain the
correct positioning, focus on a spot on the floor that is in line with the hand that
is bracing your upper body. To help protect your low back, set your core muscles
while performing this exercise. Doing this helps prevent excessive rotation of
your upper body, which is a form of cheating.

This exercise targets the primary and secondary muscles in a manner that is
beneficial to several demands encountered while swimming the four competitive
strokes. Butterfly and breaststroke swimmers will benefit through strengthening
of the undulating or wavelike body movements that are integral to their
movement through the water. The exercise also helps to strengthen the
underwater dolphin kick. The exercise can also improve the start by helping the
swimmer extend into a streamlined position off the blocks or, in the case of
backstroke, by helping the swimmer get off the wall and into the water.

Although this looks like a straightforward exercise, it is challenging to perform
because it depends not necessarily on strength but on the ability to react
dynamically to the challenge of balancing on the physioball while
simultaneously holding the streamlined body position. Balance can be improved
by first becoming comfortable with the physioball back extension exercise
previously described. To transition into performing the full streamline, begin by
alternating a single arm into the streamlined position while using the other hand
for balance. You will find the exercise easier to perform by focusing first on
positioning the legs and then slowly bringing the arms into position, rather than
trying to get into position quickly. Slightly deflating the physioball will also
make the exercise easier to perform.

Swimming Focus
The goal of this exercise is to develop strength and confidence in holding a
streamlined position. An advantage of this exercise is that on land, unlike in the
water, a swimmer can be directly provided with feedback while holding the
streamlined position.
A good place to start is the intermediate position, in which the arms are held
along the sides instead of overhead as in a streamline. The transition from the
intermediate to the advanced position can be progressed by reaching out with
one arm at a time. The difficulty of the exercise can be varied by altering the
positioning of the physioball. Positioning the ball closer to the feet increases the
difficulty of the exercise, and moving it closer to the head makes the exercise
easier.

This exercise does an excellent job of tying activation of the gluteal and
hamstring muscles to the core. Although you are facing upward when
performing this exercise, it will strengthen the muscles that contribute to the
undulating body movements that are performed during butterfly, breaststroke,
and dolphin kicking.
Before raising your hips off the ground, set your core as described in chapter
5. Doing this will isolate the exercise to the primary and secondary muscle
groups and prevent injury to the low back. The difficulty of the exercise can be
varied by altering the position of your feet on the ball. The less contact you have
with the ball, the more difficult the exercise will be. The highest level of
difficulty occurs when only your heels are touching the top of the ball. This
exercise also serves as the foundation for the physioball hamstring curl described
in chapter 7.

--- Page 364 Text ---
SAFETY TIP
Make sure that you maintain shoulder contact with the ground. You
should not feel pressure on the head or neck when performing this
exercise.
VARIATION
Single-Leg Physioball Bridge

This advanced version of the exercise should be initiated after you are able
to maintain good control of your hips while performing the bridge exercise.
The ultimate goal is to hold the hips in the bridged position, lift one leg for
5 seconds, lower it back to the ball, lift the opposite leg for 5 seconds, and
then continue this alteration for 60 seconds.

CHAPTER 7
LEGS
Strong legs are a critical component to reaching your true potential as a
swimmer. They are not only the basis for having a powerful and efficient kick
but also the key to driving your body off the starting blocks and turn walls. They
also play an often overlooked role as a member of the kinetic chain by balancing
your stroke mechanics and contributing to a tight streamline.
The lower extremity consists of three major joints—the hip, the knee, and the
ankle. Five bones make up the three joints. The pelvis serves as the link between
both legs and the torso. Each thigh is composed of a single long bone called the
femur. The lower leg contains the tibia and fibula. The talus is the bone that
serves as the connecting point between the ankle and lower leg. The hip joint is
formed by the bony socket of the pelvis, called the acetabulum, and the head of
the femur, which is shaped like a ball. The knee is the junction of the femur and
the tibia, and the ankle is composed of the lower ends of the tibia and fibula and
the upper part of the talus.
As a ball-and-socket joint, the hip is capable of a wide range of movements
that can be described in three pairs. Flexion involves lifting the thigh upward
toward the ceiling as if you are lifting your leg to climb a set of stairs. Extension
is movement of the thigh backward. Abduction occurs when the leg is moved to
the side away from the midline of the body, and adduction is the movement of

--- Page 367 Text ---
bringing the leg back toward the midline of the body. Internal rotation is the
process of touching the big toe of each foot together along the midline of the
body. External rotation is the opposite and allows you to touch the back end of
both heels together.
At the knee, a hinge joint, two primary movements occur. Flexion is the
process of pulling the heel to the buttocks, and extension is straightening the
knee from a flexed position. Four movements take place at the ankle joint. The
process of pointing your toes, as you do in a tight streamline, is plantarflexion.
Lifting your toes off the ground and toward your shin is called dorsiflexion.
Rolling your ankle inward so that the bottom of your foot faces the midline of
your body is inversion. Finally, eversion involves twisting your foot outward as
you would before initiating a breaststroke kick.
The muscles of the leg can be categorized as those that act on the hip and knee
and those that act on the ankle. The thigh and hip muscles can further be
categorized into the following groupings: anterior, medial, gluteal, and posterior.
Within the anterior grouping are seven muscles. The iliopsoas (figure 7.1 on
page 142) is a deep muscle that arises from the anterior aspect of the lumbar
vertebrae and the inner aspect of the pelvis and then crosses the hip joint to
attach to the proximal femur. The primary movement generated by the iliopsoas
is hip flexion. The quadriceps femoris, the largest muscle group in the body, is
divided into four separate muscles that are named according to their point of
origin. The rectus femoris, the only one to cross both the hip and knee, originates
from the anterior aspect of the pelvis. The vastus lateralis arises from the lateral
aspect of the femur, the vastus medialis arises from the medial aspect of the
femur, and the vastus intermedius is in the middle. All four muscles have a
common insertion on the anterior aspect of the tibia through the patellar tendon
and function to extend the knee. Because the rectus femoris crosses the hip joint,
it also functions as a hip flexor. The tensor fasciae latae (TFL) runs from the
anterior aspect of the pelvis to combine with the iliotibial band (IT band), a
thickened band of fascial tissue that runs down the lateral thigh. It then inserts on
the lateral aspect of the tibia just below the knee joint. The primary actions of the
TFL are hip flexion, abduction, and internal rotation. The final muscle of the
anterior group is the sartorius, which is a long straplike muscle that runs
diagonally from the anterior pelvis to the medial aspect of the tibia. Its primary
actions are to flex, abduct, and externally rotate the hip.
The medial grouping can be divided into the adductor muscle family and two
additional muscles that lie in close proximity. The adductor family is composed
of three muscles (adductor magnus, adductor longus, and adductor brevis),
which all arise from the inferior portion of the pelvis near the midline of the

--- Page 368 Text ---
body and attach to the medial aspect of the femur. As the name implies, the
primary function of this muscle family is hip adduction. Just superior to the
adductors is the pectineus, which also originates from the inferior pelvis near the
midline of the body and then inserts along the medial aspect of the femur.
Besides assisting the adductors, the pectineus also flexes the hip. The gracilis is
the most medial and inferior. It has the same origin as the other muscles but
crosses the knee to attach on the medial aspect of the tibia just below the knee
joint. Besides adducting the hip, the gracilis is also a secondary flexor of the
knee.
Figure 7.1 Muscles of the front of the legs.
The gluteal group contains the three gluteal muscles and a collection of six
deep rotators. The gluteus maximus (figure 7.2), the largest and most superficial
of the gluteal muscles, arises from the posterior half of the pelvis and a portion
of an adjacent bone called the sacrum. It then crosses the hip joint to combine
with the IT band, also attaching to a small portion of the femur. The main action
of the gluteus maximus is extension of the hip. It also assists other muscles in the

region with external rotation of the hip. The gluteus medius and minimus both
lie deep to the gluteus maximus and arise from the lateral part of the pelvis. The
two muscles cross the hip joint, attaching to a bony prominence on the femur
called the greater trochanter. Both muscles function to abduct and internally
rotate the hip. The deep rotators are a collection of six small muscles (piriformis,
gemellus superior, gemellus inferior, obturator externus, obturator internus, and
quadratus femoris) that combine to rotate the hip externally and, like the rotator
cuff at the shoulder, stabilize the hip joint.
Figure 7.2 Muscles of the back of the legs.
The posterior group is composed of the three hamstring muscles. The biceps
femoris, as the name implies, has two heads, one arising from a part of the pelvis
called the ischial tuberosity and the other arising from the lower posterior aspect
of the femur. The two heads combine to form a common tendon that inserts on
the head of the fibula. The other two hamstring muscles, the semitendinosus and
semimembranosus, also originate from the ischial tuberosity but run along the
medial aspect of the knee joint to attach at the medial surface of the superior part

of the tibia. Collectively, the muscles extend the hip and flex the knee.
The muscles of the lower leg can be grouped according to their actions at the
ankle joint. The gastrocnemius and soleus are the primary plantarflexors and
share an insertion into the Achilles tendon. The tibialis anterior and posterior,
named according to their attachment location on the tibia, function to invert the
foot. The fibularis muscle group (fibularis tertius, fibularis brevis, and fibularis
longus), located on the lateral aspect of the ankle joint, originates from the fibula
and has the primary function of foot eversion.
For discussion purposes, the muscle recruitment patterns of the freestyle and
backstroke flutter kick are described jointly because the patterns are practically
identical. The propulsive portion of the flutter kick begins with the torso and
core-stabilizing musculature acting as the foundation on which your legs
generate their force. The actual kicking movements begin with the hips in a
small amount of extension. From this extended position the iliopsoas and rectus
femoris are activated to initiate hip flexion. Also acting on the knee joint, the
rectus femoris initiates knee extension and is quickly joined by the remainder of
the quadriceps group, which helps to increase the force produced during the
kick. These muscles remain active throughout the entire propulsive phase of the
kick. At the ankle joint, the tibialis anterior and tibialis posterior work in concert
to maintain the foot in a position of slight inversion, while contraction of the
gastrocnemius and soleus plantarflexes the foot. The hip extension that takes
place during the recovery phase is guided by the hamstrings and gluteus
maximus. Unlike in flutter kicking, during butterfly and dolphin kicking the
torso serves not only as the foundation for the kick but also as a component. The
undulating body movements of the torso initiate the kick, and paired movements
of the legs follow in a manner identical to the action of the flutter kick. One
difference in the paired movement of the legs is that a greater amount of flexion
and extension occurs at both the hips and knees. The undulating movement of
the torso is guided by the contraction of the abdominal and erector spinae
muscles, but the muscles that guide the movements of the legs are identical to
those used in the flutter kick.
The starting point for the propulsive phase of the breaststroke kick is with the
feet 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) apart and the knees and hips flexed. From this
position the TFL, gluteus medius, and gluteus minimus internally rotate and
abduct the hips, which results in the legs further separating from each other. As
the ankles begin to separate, the biceps femoris contracts, pulling on the outer
portion of the lower leg, which externally rotates the lower leg and results in
further separation of the ankles. At the same time the fibularis muscle group
contracts to evert the foot. These combined movements place the legs in the

--- Page 371 Text ---
position to begin the whip portion of the kick. From this position the gluteus
maximus contracts forcefully to extend the hip, the quadriceps muscle group
functions to extend the knee, and the powerful adductor muscles (adductor
magnus, adductor longus, adductor brevis, pectineus, and gracilis) pull both legs
back toward the midline of the body. At the ankle joint the tibialis posterior,
gastrocnemius, and soleus contract to return the ankle to a streamlined
plantarflexed position for the glide portion of the stroke. Recovery is
accomplished by recruitment of the rectus femoris and iliopsoas, which serve to
flex the hip, and recruitment of the hamstrings, which serve to flex the knee.

SAFETY TIP
Improper squat technique is one of the leading causes of injuries
during dryland or weight-room training. Be sure to start with a light
weight and add weight only when you have become comfortable with
performing the lift and have had a certified strength and conditioning
professional review your technique.

--- Page 376 Text ---
Swimming Focus
Squats are a good all-around exercise because they recruit all major muscles
groups of the lower extremity. Increasing the strength of the knee extensors
transfers to improved force generation and endurance when kicking, regardless
of stroke. Strengthening of the gluteal muscles, specifically the gluteus
maximus, helps to improve the force that is generated with the extension of the
hip during the breaststroke kick. Because of the similarities in the movements
performed in squats and starts, particularly flat starts, squats should be a
mainstay exercise for enhancing a swimmer’s start.
Extra caution should be used because of the potential for injury to the low
back or knees. To protect the low back, beginners should start with just the bar
until they are fully comfortable with the exercise. Emphasizing tightening of the
core musculature, as described in the introduction to chapter 5, will also help
protect the low back. The most common causes for injury to the knee are shifting
of the knees forward past the toes or allowing the knees to collapse inward when
squatting down.

--- Page 377 Text ---
VARIATION
Overhead Squat
Advantages of overhead squats are that they place a focus on maintaining
an upright body posture and develop strength and confidence with the arms
in an overhead position. Weight used is much less than in a traditional
squat, so starting this exercise with a wooden dowel is best.

Swimming Focus
Like double-leg squats, single-leg squats target all the major muscle groups of
the lower extremity. An advantage of single-leg squats is that they isolate one leg
at a time, which can help address muscle imbalances that may exist between the
legs. Targeting all the major muscle groups of the lower extremity improves
kicking strength and endurance as well as strength with starts and turns.
During the exercise, you should use the back leg for balance purposes only.
As your confidence and balance improve, you can substitute a physioball for a
bench. Give extra attention to the positioning of your knee as you lower into the
squatting position. Repeated inward dropping of the knee and forward
translation past the toes are technique flaws. If you notice these flaws, modify
either the weight or number of repetitions to reduce the intensity of the exercise.

Dumbbell step-ups are another good exercise for targeting all the major muscle
groups of the lower extremity at the same time. Strength gains will carry over to
improved strength and distance off the starting blocks, especially with track
starts because of the single-leg isolation, as well as turn walls. Targeting of the
knee extensors will transfer to force development and stamina with kicking.
To maximize the benefit of the exercise, emphasize a slow, controlled descent
from the top of the box. The difficulty of the exercise can be modified by
altering the height of the box.
VARIATION
Barbell Step-Up
As your strength improves, using dumbbells may become impractical, at
which time you can implement the use of a barbell. When using a barbell,
rest it on the trapezius as if you were performing a barbell squat, but be
aware that the weight will shift farther from the center of gravity compared

This exercise engages all the major muscle groups of the lower extremity in a
dynamic fashion that incorporates a balance component. Use of this exercise will
lead to improved kicking performance and have a beneficial effect on starts and
turns.
To avoid leaning your torso forward during the exercise, in the starting
position pick an object at eye level and maintain focus on that object throughout
the entire lunge. By using this technique your head will stay up, and
subsequently your torso will remain upright. Pay close attention to the position
of your knee in relation to your foot. In the ending position your lower leg
should be perpendicular to the ground.
VARIATIONS
Walking Lunge
To perform this variation, instead of pushing back, shift your weight
forward. Push off your front leg and bring your back leg to the forward
position, recreating the lunge position.
Diagonal and Lateral Lunge

Swimming Focus
This exercise targets a select group of muscles that are responsible for internal
rotation of the hips, a movement that is primarily seen in swimming during the
recovery phase of the breaststroke kick as the heels are brought toward the
buttocks. Breaststrokers will therefore benefit most from the exercise. But other
swimmers should not ignore the exercise, because a small rotational component
takes place during the other strokes. Like the rotator cuff muscles of the
shoulder, these muscles play a protective role and help stabilize the hip joint.
This exercise is also useful for teaching balance and postural control, especially
for younger swimmers.
Emphasis should be placed on the rotational movements performed during
exercise because this is the key to targeting the rotary muscles. The knee
extensors and gluteus maximus can also be incorporated by adding a slight knee
bend as you reach toward the ground. As your confidence and strength grow,
you can hold a medicine ball in both hands to increase the difficulty of the
exercise.

By targeting a group of muscles that are responsible for externally rotating the
hip, this exercise can help increase the forces generated during the propulsive
phase of the breaststroke kick. Like the hip’s internal rotators, the external
rotators also function as hip stabilizers, making this an exercise that all
swimmers should consider for injury prevention purposes. The single-leg nature
of the exercise and combined movements of the upper trunk also make this a
useful exercise for improving balance and linking movements between the upper
and lower extremities. As mentioned in the previous exercise, the emphasis
should be on maintaining balance and the rotational movements. The knee
extensors and gluteus maximus can also be incorporated by adding a slight knee
bend as you reach toward the ground. As your confidence and strength grow,
you can hold a medicine ball in both hands to increase the difficulty of the

The primary targets of RDLs are the gluteus maximus and the hamstring muscle
group, muscles that are important in extending the hips when performing starts
and when transitioning into a streamlined position off each turn wall. The gluteal
muscles and hamstrings are also important in extending the hips during the
propulsive portion of the breaststroke kick.
To ensure proper performance of the exercise, focus on the following: (1)
Keep your head up because looking downward will roll the shoulders and place
extra stress on the back, (2) keep the back flat during the entire movement, and
(3) isolate the movement to the hips.

Swimming Focus
Breaststrokers who want to strengthen their hamstrings will find this a useful
exercise. This exercise is also valuable because it targets the hamstrings, gluteus
maximus, and erector spinae, which contribute to holding a tight streamlined
position. Those who do not have access to a formal weight room will find this a
good exercise for the hamstrings because the only equipment needed is a
physioball.
Before implementing this exercise, you must first master the physioball bridge
exercise described in chapter 6 (page 138). To maintain proper body position, the
core muscles must be activated during the entire exercise. Failure to recruit the
core stabilizers will cause the hips to drop downward and decrease the
effectiveness of the exercise. To avoid placing undue stress on the neck and
head, make sure that you maintain shoulder contact with the ground.

be on holding the body in a straight line from the ankles through the knees,
hips, and shoulders.

Execution
1. Lie facedown on a hamstring curl machine and hook your heels under the
roller pads.
2. Pull your heels toward your buttocks in an arcing motion.
3. Slowly lower the weight to the starting position.

--- Page 420 Text ---
Muscles Involved
Primary:Biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus
Secondary:Gastrocnemius

--- Page 421 Text ---
Swimming Focus
Although the hamstrings actively contribute to the kicking motions performed
during all four strokes, their involvement is greatest in the recovery phase of the
breaststroke kick as the heels are drawn toward the buttocks. Swimmers tend to
be quad dominant, resulting in a strength imbalance between the quadriceps and
hamstrings. To address this imbalance, swimmers should incorporate exercises
that isolate the hamstrings.
Breaststrokers should rotate the toes outward to mimic more closely the
movements performed in the water. This positioning also increases recruitment
of the biceps femoris. Avoid lifting the hips off the bench when performing the
exercise. Perform the movements in a slow, controlled fashion. Do not try to
kick the roller pads toward your buttocks; pull them instead.

Leg Extension

--- Page 424 Text ---
Execution
1. Sit on the leg extension machine and hook your ankles under the roller
pads.
2. Extend your legs until your knees are straight.
3. Slowly lower your legs back down to the starting position.

--- Page 425 Text ---
Muscles Involved
Primary:Rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, vastus medialis
Secondary:None

--- Page 426 Text ---
Swimming Focus
This exercise directly targets the quadriceps muscle group and the rectus femoris
in a manner that helps to strengthen the propulsive kicking phase of all four
strokes. The same muscles also contribute to the lower-extremity movements
that take place during starts and when pushing off a turn wall.
To maximize the benefit of the exercise, you must fully extend the knees in
the ending position and lower the weight in a slow, controlled manner. When
performing the exercise, focus on pushing the roller pads as opposed to trying to
kick them toward the ceiling.
SAFETY TIP
Swimmers who are currently experiencing knee pain or have a recent
history of it should avoid this exercise because it can place increased
stress on the patellar tendon and the undersurface of the patella
(kneecap) as it glides over the femur.

--- Page 430 Text ---
Muscles Involved
Primary:Tensor fasciae latae, gluteus medius
Secondary:Gluteus maximus, rectus femoris

--- Page 431 Text ---
Swimming Focus
The tensor fasciae latae and gluteus medius are two important stabilizers of the
pelvis. They also make minor contributions to the kicking movements that take
place with all four strokes. Strengthening of these muscles is often overlooked in
dryland programs. This exercise should be cycled into the dryland program at
various times during the year to ensure that the muscles do not become
neglected. Breaststrokers, who depend more on strong and stable hips, should
incorporate it more often. The involvement of the rectus femoris and gluteus
maximus can be increased by increasing the amount of knee flexion.
SAFETY TIP
Placing the exercise band below the knee can put undue stress on the
tendons and ligaments surrounding the knee.

--- Page 432 Text ---
VARIATION
Band Diagonal Shuffle
Adding the diagonal movement will greatly increase the activation of the
rectus femoris, which can improve kicking strength across all the strokes.
This variation, however, will decrease the activation of the gluteus medius.

--- Page 433 Text ---
Standing Hip Adduction

--- Page 435 Text ---
Execution
1. Stand sideways to a backstroke flagpole with a band fixed to the pole and
the ankle closer to the pole. Tighten your core muscles to stabilize your
hips.
2. Allow the resistance of the band to pull your leg out to the side.
3. Keeping your knee straight, pull your leg across and in front of the
stabilizing leg.
4. Slowly return to the starting position.

--- Page 436 Text ---
Muscles Involved
Primary:Adductor magnus, adductor longus, adductor brevis, pectineus, gracilis
Secondary:Transversus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique

--- Page 437 Text ---
Swimming Focus
Direct targeting of the adductor muscle group can help the breaststroker increase
the strength and stamina of the kick.
When performing the exercise, tightening the core stabilizers and holding the
upper body in a tall, upright posture will help to isolate the adductor muscle
group. Swimmers who are currently experiencing or have a recent history of
knee pain should anchor the resistance band just above the knee.

Execution for Inversion
1. Supporting the foot off the ground, wrap the exercise band around the
forefoot so that the resistance is coming from an anchor point to the
outside of the foot performing the exercise.
2. Without rotating the knee or hip, pull the toes toward the midline of the
body.
3. Slowly return to the starting position.

--- Page 442 Text ---
Execution for Eversion
1. Supporting the foot off the ground, wrap the exercise band around the
forefoot so that the resistance is coming from an anchor point to the
inside of the foot performing the exercise.
2. Without rotating the knee or hip, pull the toes away from the midline of
the body.
3. Slowly return to the starting position.

--- Page 443 Text ---
Muscles Involved
Primary:Tibialis anterior and tibialis posterior (invertors); fibularis longus and
fibularis brevis (evertors)
Secondary:Flexor digitorum longus and flexor hallucis longus (invertors);
fibularis tertius (evertor)

--- Page 444 Text ---
Swimming Focus
The ankle invertors (tibialis anterior and tibialis posterior) and the ankle evertors
(fibularis muscle group) are important stabilizers of the ankle joint.
Incorporation of exercises targeting these muscles can help protect the ankle
joint by improving its dynamic stability. Strong ankle invertors provide support
to the ankle during flutter and fly kicking and help maintain the foot in a slightly
inverted position. Strengthening the ankle evertors helps with the positioning of
the ankle and foot as the legs are being set for the whip portion of the
breaststroke kick. The ankle evertors also provide lateral stability to the ankle,
which can help protect against ankle sprains when performing cross-training
activities such as running.

CHAPTER 8
WHOLE-BODY TRAINING
This chapter focuses on whole-body exercises that require simultaneous muscle
activation from muscles of the upper extremity, core, and lower extremity.
Because the previous chapters discussed the specifics of joint and muscle
anatomy, muscle actions, and their role in swimming, the focus of this chapter is
to describe the importance of whole-body training and the role of these exercises
in enhancing swimming performance.
The focus of the previous chapters has been on exercises that isolate a single
joint or, through a combination of movements, the joints of the upper extremity
or lower extremity. In contrast, the exercises in this chapter integrate the upper
and lower extremities during total-body movements, allowing one exercise to
link these areas with the core. These exercises involve multiple joints and
multiple muscle groups and are therefore very functional, or sport specific.
As the number of joints and muscle groups recruited during an exercise
increases, so does the specificity of the exercise. For example, a simple triceps
extension isolates one joint, the elbow, and one muscle group, the triceps brachii.
Comparatively, the burpee, an exercise described later in this chapter, is a total-
body exercise that incorporates movements of the lower extremity and upper
extremity and, in turn, multiple muscle groups. The differences between the two

--- Page 446 Text ---
kinds of exercises are obvious; the question that arises concerns the comparative
advantages and disadvantages of each. The primary advantage of the triceps
extension is that it isolates a single muscle group. As a result, controlling the
degree of resistance (by increasing or decreasing the weight) placed on the
muscle is easy, and the focus can be directed to strengthening only the triceps.
The main disadvantage is that the movement is not swimming specific because it
involves only a single joint. On the other hand, the primary advantage of the
burpee exercise is that multiple joints and muscle groups are involved and it
emphasizes jumping into a streamline at the end of the exercise; it is a
swimming-specific exercise. Other advantages are that it requires coordinated
movements, activates the core musculature, and includes an explosive jumping
component. Through the coordinated movements of the upper and lower
extremities and activation of the core musculature, swimmers will find that these
exercises help to improve the strength and efficiency of the strokes. A
disadvantage of burpees and other total-body exercises is that because multiple
muscle groups are recruited in unison, stronger muscles may compensate for
weaker muscles. For example, an amazingly fast swimmer may also be the
slowest kicker on the team if his or her upper-body stroke mechanics are strong
enough to compensate for the lower-extremity kicking weakness. Although total-
body exercises are important, you need to perform the more focused upper-body
and lower-body multijoint movements and additional isolation exercises to have
a comprehensive dryland program. Think of the total-body movements as your
main set and the other exercises as the drills and technique work that fine-tune
your stroke.
Besides having a total-body focus, several of the exercises emphasize
explosive movements. The principle of specificity applies here. The best way to
improve your ability to explode off the starting blocks and turn walls is to
incorporate explosive exercises into the dryland program. The primary focus
with these exercises is to help you learn to generate power through the lower
extremity and core. The advantage of using exercise outside the pool to increase
power production is that performing multiple repetitions in succession is easier,
and technique feedback and corrections are more easily provided.
With these exercises come some special considerations. The first is that
because these exercises incorporate multiple joint movements, the joint
movements must be properly coordinated. An example of a poorly coordinated
exercise would be to start the streamline before starting the jump when
performing the burpee exercise. Initiating the streamline early removes the
force-generating swinging motion of the arms that helps you jump higher. A
swimming analogy would be to bring your arms into a streamlined position

--- Page 447 Text ---
before initiating your jumping motion off the starting block. Lack of
coordination can turn a total-body movement into several isolated single-joint
exercises, decreasing the sport specificity. Additionally, because of the
complicated nature of the exercises, technique perfection should be imperative.
Therefore, when first using these exercises, you should focus on the quality of
the movement, not the quantity. This advice is especially relevant with the
jumping and explosive exercises, not only because uncontrolled explosive
movements present a high risk for injuries but also because the associated
landings place increased stress on the lower extremities. One way to ensure
proper technique is to begin these exercises by using little or no weight to
engrain proper technique before building strength or power. A final
consideration is the importance of the core-stabilizing musculature when
performing these exercises. The core stabilizers function not only as the link
between upper-and lower-body movements but also as stabilizers and protectors
of the upper and lower back. Therefore, you must set the core stabilizers at the
start of every exercise. Chapter 5 provides a thorough overview of how to set the
core stabilizers.
A group of total-body exercises known as the Olympic lifts are extremely
beneficial in developing speed, strength, and power. But because these complex
exercises require teaching and supervision by qualified personnel (such as
certified strength coaches), they are not included in this text. Two of the more
common Olympic lifts that should be considered for advanced swimmers, when
adequate instruction and supervision are available, are the hang clean and the
hang snatch. These are two of the best total-body exercises for developing power
through the core and lower extremity. Swimmers who specialize in the sprint
events (50 to 100 meters or yards) will benefit the most from these lifts. The
primary gains will be in explosiveness off the starting blocks and turn walls.
Because of the skills required to perform these exercises, guidance should be
obtained from a certified Olympic weightlifting coach or a certified strength and
conditioning specialist.
All the exercises included in this chapter are beneficial because they are total-
body in nature and, like the Olympic lifts, help to generate strength and power
through the core. Advantages of these exercises are that they do not necessarily
require instruction and supervision by a certified strength coach. As a general
reminder, you should always have a coach supervise your program so that you
can receive continual feedback on your technique.

--- Page 452 Text ---
Swimming Focus
By linking the movements of the upper and lower extremities and incorporating
trunk rotational movements, this exercise strengthens the linkage between the
arms and legs during freestyle and backstroke. Emphasizing shoulder retraction
at the end of the exercise will transfer to the initial recovery process during
freestyle.
To enhance the linkage between the arms and legs, setting the core at the start
of the exercise is crucial. Doing this engages the core-stabilizing musculature.
When performing the exercise, you should perform the movements of the upper
and lower extremities in unison; separating the movements will decrease the
cross-linking benefits. As with other exercises involving the lower extremity,
when dropping down, the front of the knee should not extend past the tip of the
toes.

--- Page 457 Text ---
Swimming Focus
This excellent dryland exercise can be easily incorporated into a circuit-training
program because no equipment is required. The primary focus of the exercise is
the transition from the push-up position into the streamlined position.
Emphasizing quickness when drawing the feet up under the hips will improve
your speed with the open turns performed during butterfly and breaststroke.
Jumping into a tight streamlined position will transfer to improved streamlining
off the turn walls for all strokes.
As with regular push-ups, holding a tight body position is important; you
should be able to draw a straight line from the ankles, through the hips, to the tip
of the head. Sagging or arching of the low back is a technique flaw that can lead
to undue stress on the spine. To protect the body, particularly the knees, from
excessive pounding, you should land from the jump with the knees slightly bent
to absorb the landing. Performing the exercise on a nonslip exercise mat will
help protect the lower extremities from excessive pounding.

--- Page 458 Text ---
SAFETY TIP
Before incorporating this exercise into the dryland program for a
young swimmer, he or she should demonstrate the strength and
coordination to perform a push-up properly.

--- Page 463 Text ---
Swimming Focus
This transitional exercise helps you focus on exploding off the starting blocks
into a tight streamlined position. As you jump from the blocks, the initial focus
should be on jumping for maximal height. The focus then quickly shifts to
holding the tight, vertical streamline. A reaction drill component can be added to
the exercise by having you jump on cue.
SAFETY TIP
For safety reasons, the exercise should be performed only where the
pool is at least 5 feet (150 cm) deep. The depth of the pool will dictate
how long the swimmer should hold the streamlined position. For

--- Page 464 Text ---
shallower pools, the swimmer should break the streamline by slightly
bending the knees on entry into the water to absorb the landing when
reaching the bottom of the pool. With deeper pools, the streamline can
be held longer, ideally until the entire body has entered the water.
VARIATION
Dryland Block Jump Start Into Streamlined Position
The dryland variation can be used to incorporate the exercise into a circuit
program or a lifting program in a weight-room environment. To avoid
placing undue stress on the joints of the lower extremity, the knees should
be slightly bent to absorb the landing when initially contacting the ground.

--- Page 469 Text ---
Swimming Focus
This exercise specifically targets the muscles that you use to explode off the
starting blocks. The key to maximizing the benefit of the exercise is to position
the exercise bands so that in the starting position a small amount of tension is
already placed on the bands. This tension ensures that the increased resistance
and strengthening benefits will occur throughout the entire movement.
To make the exercise as realistic as possible, you should focus on transitioning
into a streamlined position, just as you would during a regular start. To protect
your back, set the core-stabilizing musculature at the start of the exercise and
hold it tight during the entire movement. After forward movement ends, you can
bring a foot forward to stabilize the body. Reaching out and then falling on an
outstretched hand is a common cause of injury to the upper extremity.

--- Page 470 Text ---
SAFETY TIP
Because of the complexity of this exercise, younger swimmers should
not perform it.

--- Page 475 Text ---
Swimming Focus
Box jumps are a valuable exercise for developing speed and strength in the
lower extremities to improve your ability to explode off the starting blocks and
turn walls. Jumping up onto the box has two primary advantages when compared
with a normal jump for height: (1) The height of the box serves as a motivational
target, and (2) landing on the box reduces the stress placed on the lower
extremities. The box jump also serves as a good exercise for learning how to use
the arms to increase the jump height, which translates into improved distance
and speed off the starting blocks. You can increase jump height by explosively
swinging the arms at the initiation of the jump.
Two common flaws associated with the exercise are tucking the legs to the
chest instead of truly jumping up in the air and not keeping the chest up.

--- Page 476 Text ---
SAFETY TIP
To avoid placing undue stress on the lower extremity, step down softly
off the box instead of jumping down.

Swimming Focus
The overhead reaching component of the exercise helps swimmers, particularly
backstrokers, develop confidence and strength when initiating their stroke. The
combined diagonal and rotational movements make this a good exercise for
strengthening the core musculature while at the same time enhancing the linkage
between the upper extremity and lower extremity. The leg component helps all
swimmers improve their strength during starts and turns. Backstrokers will find
the exercise particularly useful because it is a dryland exercise that allows them
to focus on linking the movements of their arms and legs in a manner similar to
that used in performing a start off the wall.
Added emphasis can be placed on the legs by deepening the squat at the start
of the exercise. As with other lower-extremity exercises, be sure that the knee
does not translate past the tips of the toes. To incorporate the trunk rotational
movement, visually focus on following the path of the hands while performing
the entire movement.
A good way to introduce this exercise to young swimmers is to begin with no
resistance and later use a low-weight medicine ball.

--- Page 482 Text ---
VARIATION
Diagonal Medicine Ball Lift
Using the medicine ball for resistance allows you to add an explosive
component to the exercise. When performing the movement pattern with a
