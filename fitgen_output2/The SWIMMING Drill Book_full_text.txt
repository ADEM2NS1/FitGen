Foreword
A special note for coaches from Coach Kirk Johansen.
A few years ago, I attended a coaching conference where one of the speak-
ers was the late, great Cecil Colwin, the legendary swim coach from Canada
who wrote Swimming Into The 21st Century. One of the points that Cecil made
is that we, as coaches, need to strive to reach a level of “intuitive coaching.”
He described this kind of coaching as having such a solid foundation of
stroke technique drills and teaching skills that we can adjust each individual
swimmer’s stroke technique to help him or her become more efficient and
effective. Only by having a strong foundation in the fundamentals can we
then “make things up” and be creative enough to modify a swimmer’s stroke
so that she or he achieves a personal best performance.
I have been a coach and teacher for many years, and I have learned that we
as coaches are always teaching. For us to evolve as teachers, we need to learn
and grow constantly. We always have to practice teaching the fundamentals
that are presented in this book. And then, with practice and repetition, as with
anything else, we can take these fundamental drills and stretch them to fit
the needs of our swimmers. This is the art of coaching—intuitive coaching.
It’s no accident that Cecil Colwin endorsed the first edition of this book.
My invitation to coaches at any level is to use this book as I have—to master
the teaching of these drills as appropriate for your group of swimmers.
Then, observe your swimmers carefully and be prepared to change. Be
open to making continual adjustments in how you teach. Remember, the
swimmers are merely a reflection of your teaching and coaching. Don’t be
afraid to be different and to experiment. That approach is precisely how this
book came together—because Ruben is an innovator and has observed and
experimented with teaching his swimmers for many years. Having known
Ruben for over 25 years, I have seen that his teams were clearly well coached.
His swimmers had excellent stroke technique and executed their races with
precision. This book will help you do the same with your swimmers.
Most important, have fun!

Preface
In the past several years, since the writing of Swimming Drills for Every
Stroke, exciting new developments have occurred in the understanding of
how the body can move more efficiently and fluidly through the water.
Research continues to show that the most significant factors in improved
performance are technical—efficiency of strokes, starts, and turns—rather
than physical conditioning. The Swimming Drill Book incorporates those
developments into a refined series of drills that have produced excellent
results. In addition, the language of communicating these new concepts and
skills to both age-group and senior-level swimmers has been fine-tuned so
that swimmers get it almost right away.
The book begins with a chapter on body position and buoyancy. Most of
these concepts were derived from Dr. Bill Boomer, the U.S. Olympic swim-
ming team guru. By simplifying the drills and developing a specific sequence
of practicing the drills in daily workouts, swimmers have improved in effi-
ciency from 25 to 40 percent.
A chapter on breathing and kicking and one on sculling will prepare
swimmers for the chapters on the individual strokes. A new concept in the
book concerns the body angle while swimming backstroke and freestyle.
By using the sciences of physics and kinesiology, I have tested stroke effi-
ciency to show that the optimal level of rotation is not 90 degrees, a popular
notion, but approximately 45 degrees. The physics of the human body and
its buoyancy are analogous to that of a sailboat, prompting the concept of
the “sailboat angle” of rotation. From the kinesiological perspective, this
concept is consistent with producing maximum muscular power through-
out the entire stroke cycle.
Improving in the pool isn’t only about body position, breathing and kick-
ing, and the strokes. Quick starts, turns, and finishes are also important to
the success of the swimmer. Three chapters provide an array of drills for
every type of start, turn, and finish. Additionally, the new final chapter
incorporates strength training drills done outside of the pool to enhance
swimmers’ performance. This training complements work done in the pool
and enables athletes and coaches to work on improving fitness along with
swimming skills.
Coaches and swimmers at all levels can use this book to increase practice
effectiveness, improve competitive times, and enhance fitness.

Introduction
Swimming requires a combination of physical strength and technical
finesse. Because water is foreign to humans, the technical aspects of moving
through it become critical at the competitive level. Most swimmers who
participate in the sport are relatively inexperienced in proper technique.
For them, progress is dramatic when their technique improves. But even
for the most experienced swimmer, small technical improvements can
make the difference between qualifying and not qualifying for nationals
or Olympic trials.
This book covers the fundamentals needed for competitive swimming.
All the essential drills are presented to ensure that a swimmer is compe-
tent in the basics of competitive swimming. Mastering the basics builds the
foundation of future development and refinement.
Swimmers need to have a planned approach to developing good technique
that is simple to learn, proven, and tested. Swimmers who use this book will
benefit by learning effective ways to practice the skills of swimming. They
will perform better and swim faster in competition. They are more likely to
stay interested in swimming and will therefore enjoy the sport more.
Coaches need to have a well-planned, comprehensive curriculum. They
also need a system that is flexible and can be adapted to a variety of situa-
tions. This book will help coaches by providing an organized approach to
stroke instruction. By using this system, they can communicate the course
outline more effectively in advance, thereby gaining support from swim-
mers and parents. After a coach becomes skilled in using these drills, he or
she can easily detect and correct stroke deficiencies, helping the athletes
become faster and better swimmers.
Let’s say you have 16 weeks to prepare for a major competition. A good
way to organize instruction is to divide drill training into three sections.
Spend the first 9 weeks teaching the drills presented in this book in chap-
ters 1 through 7 and 9 in sequential order. Cover one chapter per week.
Next, over the following 4 weeks, repeat the drills in chapters 3 through 6
to polish and correct technique. To warm up, spend 3 weeks focusing on
starts, turns, and finishes (chapters 9 through 11), along with brushing up
any major stroke deficiencies.

xvi Introduction
After you have your overall 16-week plan in place, organize each week
like this:
Day 1: Introduce the first two or three drills and practice them.
Day 2: Review the drills learned the previous day and then introduce
three or four more and practice them.
Day 3: Review all the drills previously learned and introduce the final set
of drills and practice them.
Day 4 and 5: Review all key drills in a progression.
Do your normal warm-up routine, but include at least one key drill learned
the previous day. After you have covered the entire system, a key drill from
each stroke can become part of the warm-up. Each week, change the key drill.
Your swimmers should memorize the key drills and preform them weekly.
To introduce and teach each drill, follow these steps:
• Explain: Provide a complete description of how the drill is performed.
• Demonstrate: Show how the drill is performed by using the diagrams
or demonstrate the drill yourself. (With younger swimmers, a helpful
approach is to use a swimmer of the same age who is proficient in the
drill to demonstrate.)
• Correct: Have swimmers perform the drill after your initial explana-
tion and demonstration. Point out what they have done correctly. Next,
focus on one point at a time. Correct any errors until the swimmers do
the drill properly.
• Repeat: After the swimmers can perform the drill correctly, have them
repeat it until the drill becomes a habit. Make sure that the swimmers
do not develop improper techniques.
Running practices that focus on stoke technique requires a commitment
to improve. Many coaches rarely focus on technique during their practices
because they believe it can take away from “training.” But when a swim-
mer has developed bad habits of poor stroke technique, improving those
deficiencies can be very difficult. Slowing down and giving the swimmers
an opportunity to practice these drills through repetition and correction
will vastly improve their efficiently. In my practices, we dedicate part of
the warm-up and at least one set strictly to drill work. We are constantly
practicing and reinforcing the skills in this book to continue our efforts to
improve. I try to correct stroke deficiencies quickly to prevent my swimmers
from developing any bad habits.
Coaches, your job is not an easy one, and the rewards come all too slowly.
I hope that this material makes your job easier and more enjoyable.
Swimmers, my hope is that you enjoy performing these drills. You likely
have much to learn about swimming. Learn it a little at a time. I hope that
this book helps you master all the important skills and helps you swim
easier and faster.

Chapter 1
Body Position
and Buoyancy
Water is not a natural environment for humans. To move through the water, you
must learn to relax and allow the water to support your natural buoyancy—
that is, your ability to float. Positioning the body for maximum buoyancy with
minimum effort is fundamental to swimming faster.
One of the keys to improving body position and buoyancy is understand-
ing that head position often dictates the ease with which the rest of the body
moves through the water. Because of the dense weight of the head, slight
changes in its position can significantly alter the position of the trunk and
legs. If the head is too high, there is increased drag through the torso and
the kick is much less effective. If the head is too low, drag increases as well.
The goal is to create a connected body line from the head through the spine.
The drills in this chapter will
• enable you to feel how your body is positioned in the water,
• improve your ability to relax and allow your body to be supported by
the water,
• improve your ability to move through the water with less effort, and
• improve your efficiency in swimming all the strokes.
You can improve your strokes almost instantly by learning how to relax
and control your body position. Although these drills are simple, they pro-
vide a transformational foundation for how you experience your body in
the water and for improved performance. Even experienced swimmers gain
tremendous improvement in their efficiency by practicing these drills. In
my experience coaching swimmers in my stroke clinics, these drills alone
can improve efficiency (measured by strokes per lap) by 25 to 40 percent
on average. Whether you are a beginner or an international-level swimmer,
these drills are fundamental to your success.

1 HEAD AND BODY POSITION
Purpose
To help you experience the different sections of your body and to learn the
importance of head position.
Procedure
1. Stand on deck with your back to a wall that is taller than you.
2. Place your heels against the wall.
3. Push your hips against the wall.
4. Tuck your chin in and place your shoulder blades against the wall.
5. Gently move your head back until it is touching the wall. You should
now have four contact points: heels, hips, shoulder blades, and back of
head.
6. Take a small step away from the wall and try to maintain the same
posture.
7. Step back against the wall to see whether you were successful.
Focus Points
• This posture will likely feel different from your normal standing posture.
That’s okay. Just feel how your body is lined up when these four contact
points are touching the wall.
• Start with your heels and then move up to your hips, shoulder blades,
and head.
Tips
• Practice standing or sitting with your ribs stretched upward. This will
help you maintain good posture in and out of the water.
• Have a buddy correct you if you slouch.
• Try to create a straight line from the top of your head, through your spine,
and down to your hips.

4 STANDING STREAMLINE
Purpose
To introduce the streamline arm position. This skill is the most important one to
master in competitive swimming. Every stroke in competitive swimming begins
with streamline. This drill sets up the succeeding drills in the buoyancy series.
Procedure
1. Stand with your back against a wall.
2. Place your heels, hips, and shoulder blades against the wall as in the
Head and Body Position drill.
3. Allow your head to bend forward and bring your chin down.
4. With your arms out in front of you, place one hand directly over the
other with your fingerstogether. Line up your middle fingers.Whichever
hand will begin the first st oke should be on the bottom.
5. Wrap the thumb of the top hand around the bottom hand to lock your
hands so that you cannot pull them apart (a).
6. Straighten your arms overhead so that your elbows are straight and your
hands are against the wall. Your elbows should be as close together as
possible.
7. Bring your head back to rest against your arms. Now you are in a stream-
line (b).
Focus Points
• Hold your hands correctly—one hand over the other.
• Reach up and back so that your elbows are completely straight.
• Your head should be in front of your arms.
• You should feel four contact points against the wall: hands, shoulders,
hips, and heels.
Tips
• Have your coach work with you to ensure that you can do this standing
away from the wall.
• Practice in front of a mirror to check your streamline position.

5 STREAMLINE FLOAT
Purpose
To learn how to stretch your body into the streamline position and reach
maximum buoyancy, thereby allowing the water to support your body. This
is by far the most difficultexercise for many swimmers, and achieving it may
require extensive practice and body control. This is the third key drill in the
buoyancy series.
Procedure
1. Position yourself in the middle of a lane.
2. Take a deep breath and hold it.
3. Move into the dead swimmer’s float position(a).
4. Gradually extend your arms into the streamline position (b).
5. Gradually extend your legs and point your toes (c).
6. Give your body time to rise up to the surface.
7. Your goal is to have all four buoyancy points at the surface: hands,
shoulders, hips, and heels (d).
Focus Points
• Keep your chin tucked in.
• Do not force this or try to kick your way up. Let the water support your
body.
• Tighten your back and hips if your legs are sinking.
• Keep your toes pointed while you extend into the streamline position.
Tips
• Have your coach place a kickboard over your hips and heels so that you
can feel when you have pushed them to the surface.
• Partner up with a buddy so that you can check each other.

Chapter 2
Breathing and
Kicking
After your body position is adjusted for maximum buoyancy, you need to
build the foundation for breathing and kicking. Proper mechanics of breath-
ing and kicking might be the simplest skills to perform in swimming, but
they are often overlooked. Proper breathing and kicking are critical for feel-
ing comfortable in the water, maintaining good body position, and moving
quickly and efficiently through the water.
The lungs and muscles of the rib cage are designed to bring oxygen effi-
ciently to the blood stream and subsequently to the rest of the body. For
years, many people have been taught to hold their breath or to limit their
breathing while swimming. This practice can cause physiological problems
including oxygen deprivation, muscle spasms, lactic acid buildup, and loss
of consciousness. Learn how to exert conscious control over your breathing
while swimming to enhance oxygen transfer and swim more effectively.
Work in the science of swimming, especially that of Dr. Marty Hull, has
led to the development of many training devices designed to enhance kick-
ing. Even if you use these devices, you need to develop excellent kicking
propulsion while maintaining proper body position.
A fast and efficient swimmer kicks through the water with the body in a
streamline—a stretched position—and performs comfortable and relaxed
breathing. Holding the breath wastes energy.
The drills in this chapter will help you kick in a streamline position with
proper breathing. Swimming with less drag and less friction saves energy
and time. Improved kicking and breathing mechanics can often lead to dra-
matic results. This chapter is the next layer in the foundation for excellent
swimming technique.

10 OVER AND UNDER BREATHING
Purpose
To ensure correct breathing. Your breathing should be relaxed; holding your
breath wastes energy.
Procedure
1. Face the wall and hold on to the gutter with both hands. Position your
feet against the wall or on the bottom (a).
2. Tilt your head up and down from just above the surface of the water to
just below the surface (b).
3. As soon as your mouth and nose go below the surface, breathe out and
hum as you blow steady bubbles. This action will ensure a constant
exhale while you are underwater. Breathe in only when your mouth is
above the surface.
4. Breathe slowly and stay relaxed. Repeat the motion at least 20 times in
a row.
Focus Points
• Do not continue to breathe out when you lift your head up. If someone
can hear you breathing out or if you spray water out of your mouth, then
you need to concentrate on breathing out only underwater and breathing
in only above water.
• Breathe in through your mouth and out through your nose.
• Remember to hum as you blow bubbles!
Tips
• Place a lit candle (real or imaginary) in front of you above the surface.
Don’t blow out the candle!
• Try to hum as long as you can. When you can no longer hum while blow-
ing bubbles (hum bubbles), you are ready to breathe again.

11 FLUTTER KICK DECK DRILL
Purpose
To help you see and feel how to do the flutter kick
Procedure
1. Sit on the edge of the deck. With your toes pointed and your legs extended
straight over the water, touch just your toes to the surface of the water.
Then, lower your legs so your feet are about 12 inches (30.5 cm) under
the water. Keep your legs close together.
2. Slowly raise one foot toward the surface and then lower it back down to
12 inches (30.5 cm) under the water while raising the other foot. Continue
alternately raising and lowering your feet, making sure that your feet are
close together as they pass each other. Keep the toes pointed toward the
opposite end of the pool.
3. Kick the water up toward the surface, but do not go above the surface.
Gradually increase the speed of the kick.
4. As your speed increases, bend your knees a little and relax your ankles.
Focus Points
• Keep your toes pointed toward the opposite end of the pool. Avoid point-
ing your toes up to the sky.
• “Boil” the water, but do not splash—that is, kick just under the surface of
the water so that the motion is confinedto the surface, rather than send-
ing water into the air.
Tips
• Ask someone to stand in the water and hold his or her hand just under
the water with the palm facing the pool floo . Kick the palm with the top
of your foot. If your toes hit first, they need to be pointed mo e.
• Practice leg raises. Hold on to a bar or the back of a chair and stand straight
with one foot flaton the ground. Point the other foot out in front of you and
touch your big toe to the ground. Keeping your leg straight, lift it about
12 inches (30.5 cm) off the ground. Hold the position for two seconds.
Slowly lower your leg and touch your big toe to the ground. Repeat 10 to
20 times. Switch legs.
• Advanced variation: Do this drill as a dry-land exercise. Lie on your back
and place your hands flat underneath your buttocks. Raise your legs 6
inches (15 cm) off the ground and flutter kick with your toes pointed.
This exercise will also work your abdominal muscles! Your legs should
stay straight; kick with your upper thighs and your ankles with minimal
bend in the knees.

12 VERTICAL FLUTTER KICK
Purpose
To help you develop the full power of the flutterkick. Vertical kicking is perhaps
the quickest way to develop a powerful, efficient kick
Procedure
1. Position yourself vertically in water deep enough that your toes cannot
touch the bottom of the pool.
2. Face the lane rope and hold on to it with your arms extended.
3. Slowly flutter kick, keeping your body in a vertical position with good
posture (a). Your feet should separate about 12 inches (30.5 cm).
4. Gradually kick a little harder so that your shoulders rise above the
surface (b, c).
Focus Points
• Keep your knees fairly straight.
• Maintain excellent posture. Many swimmers tend to push their hips back;
focus on keeping them straight and staying completely erect.
• Keep your feet moving back and forth and maintain a small separation.
Avoid bending your hips and knees and doing a bicycle kick.
Tips
• When you are able, try kicking in the vertical position with sculling (see
chapter 3).
• For an added challenge, bring your hands above the surface.
• For an even greater challenge, position your arms in streamline.
• For an extreme challenge, add a weight belt.
• Advanced variation: Practice sprint kicking by performing a fast vertical
flutterkick for 20 seconds and then resting for 10 seconds. Repeat this at
least four times.

13 PUSH AND FLOAT ON BACK
Purpose
To establish the feel of the proper body position for the backstroke.
Procedure
1. Hold on to the gutter or wall and place your feet on the wall at around
hip depth, keeping your knee bend as close to 90 degrees as possible (a).
2. Let go of the wall and slowly push off with your legs. Straighten your
body and float along the surface for about five seconds
3. Keep your arms at your sides. Arch your back a little so that your
abdomen stays along the surface. Feel the bottom of your rib cage at the
surface. It’s okay if your legs sink a little (b).
4. Breathe comfortably and keep your upper body on the surface.
Focus Points
• Feel the bottom of your rib cage staying at the surface.
• Keep your head back far enough that your ears are just under the water.
• Point your toes as you float
Tip
Ask someone to place a half board or a noodle on your abdomen as you begin
to float. See how long you can keep it the e.

14 SLOW FLUTTER ON BACK
Purpose
To practice correct body position for the backstroke while adding a kicking
action.
Procedure
1. Begin with the back float from the previous drill and gradually add a
slow flutter kick. Kick just fast enough to keep the bottom of your rib
cage at the surface (a, b).
2. Kick for one lap.
3. As you pass the far side flags,place one arm above your head to ensure
that you do not crash into the wall.
4. Stop before you get to the wall.
Focus Points
• Kick as slowly as possible while maintaining correct body position.
• Stay relaxed! Keep your head back and enjoy yourself.
Tip
Ask someone to place a half board or a noodle on your abdomen as you begin
to kick. See how long you can keep it there.

15 STREAMLINE BACK FLUTTER KICK
Purpose
To introduce the streamline arm position with kicking. Maintaining a good
streamline will reduce friction and help you slice through the water with little
energy.
Procedure
1. Place one hand over the other with your fingers together. Line up your
middle fingers. Either hand can be on top
2. Wrap the thumb of the hand on top around the lower hand to lock your
hands so that you cannot pull them apart (a).
3. Straighten your arms overhead so that you cradle or brace your head
between your arms. Your arms should be at least slightly behind your
ears, and your elbows should be completely locked (b).
4. Push off the wall to a back float (as in the Push and Float on Back drill)
but hold a streamline position.
5. Gradually add a slow kick. Keep your abdomen up and make the bottom
of your rib cage your focus point. Think in the following pattern: float,
streamline, kick (c).
Focus Points
• Concentrate on each aspect in the following order: float,streamline, kick.
• Relax; don’t force it.
• Keep your toes pointed and your ankles relaxed.
• Kick slowly.
• Keep your head back. If you lift your head, your hips will sink.
• Arch your back to help keep you afloat
• Keep your hands just under the water.
Tips
• Using a kickboard or noodle (as described in the Push and Float on Back
drill) works well here.
• Stand in front of a mirror to check your streamline position.
• Observe the following three rules for an excellent streamline and commit
them to memory:
1. Place one hand over the other.
2. Lock the thumb.
3. Brace the head.

16 SLOW FLUTTER ON FRONT
Purpose
To practice correct body position for the freestyle while adding a kicking action.
Procedure
1. Start at the wall and take a deep breath.
2. Push off from the wall with your eyes facing down. The back of your
head should be touching the surface. You should also feel your shoulders,
hips, and heels at the surface.
3. Gradually add a flutter kick. Kick just fast enough to keep your hips
touching the surface.
4. Kick and slowly exhale (hum bubbles) until you need to breathe; then
stop, breathe, and repeat.
Focus Points
• Kick as slowly as possible while maintaining correct body position.
• Feel your hips touching the surface at all times.
• Kick the water, not the air. If you can hear your kick, your feet are coming
up too high.
• Keep your toes pointed.
• Kick with your ankles and thighs, not with your knees.
• Stay relaxed!
Tips
• Have your coach or a partner place a half board or noodle just above your
hips. See whether you can keep it there.
• Imagine you are snorkeling and looking at all the fish at the bottom of
the ocean.
• Perform this drill with a snorkel.

17 STREAMLINE FRONT FLUTTER KICK
Purpose
To develop good kicking mechanics while kicking freestyle on your front side.
This position is frequently used in training sets.
Procedure
1. Start at the wall and take a deep breath.
2. Push off the wall and place your hands in a prone streamline position.
Keep your hands, shoulders, hips, and heels at the surface.
3. Slide for two seconds. Then, begin a quick, steady flutter kick. Keep your
toes in the water at all times. The heels of your feet should just barely
break the surface of the water. Your hips should be right at the surface (a).
4. Keep your head tucked in under your arms. Slowly exhale to let your air
out and go as far as you can; then stop, breathe, and repeat (b).
5. As you develop your skill, start taking freestyle side breaths instead of
lifting your head to breathe.
Focus Points
• Keep your arms in the streamline position.
• Avoid lifting your feet above the surface. While splashing may look
impressive, it does nothing but waste energy.
• Keep your hips up.
Tips
• Position your head so that it is just barely breaking the surface or is
slightly below the surface. This positioning will help you get ready for
the freestyle drills.
• Do this with the snorkel.

18 BREASTSTROKE KICK DECK DRILL
Purpose
To help you see and feel how to do a proper breaststroke kick.
Procedure
1. Sit on the edge of the deck with your legs extended over the water. Keep
your heels just below the surface at all times during this exercise. Begin
with your legs together and your toes pointed. The inner sides of your
feet and your thighs should touch (a).
2. Bring your legs in toward your body (bend at the knees and keep the
heels together) until your knees are at a 90-degree angle. Keep your heels
close together and your toes pointed to the sides of the pool (b).
3. Rotate your feet out and around to catch the water with the inner sides
of your feet and your calves. Keep your knees close together through the
kick (c).
4. Squeeze the water between your legs while keeping your feet flexed (d).
5. Bring your legs completely together and finish with your toes pointed.
You should see and feel the powerful squeeze of the water.
Focus Points
• Develop the following pattern: heels in, toes out, squeeze, together.
• Finish each kick with your knees straight and your toes pointed.
• Catch as much water as possible on the inner sides of your feet when you
squeeze your legs together.
Tips
• You can practice this kick almost anywhere. Try it while you are sitting
on the floor watching television or on your bed befo e you go to sleep.
• Advanced variation: Begin in a leg-lift position and do not let your feet
touch. This exercise is great for the abdominal muscles!

19 INVERTED BREASTSTROKE KICK
Purpose
To develop a balanced breaststroke kick with good body control. This drill
prevents exaggerated hip action and improper leg mechanics. Anyone with a
weak breaststroke kick should emphasize this drill.
Procedure
1. Push off the wall and float on your back in a streamline position along
the surface (a). Keep your chest up while floating
2. After counting to three (one thousand one, one thousand two, one
thousand three), complete a breaststroke kick (b).
3. Count to three after each repetition.
Focus Points
• Keep your upper-body position stable. Your head and chest should not
go under the water. If they do, you are likely not keeping your feet up
high enough.
• Keep a tight streamline. Your hands should stay just below the surface.
• Finish each kick in a floatingposition with your chest up and your toes
pointed and near the surface.
• Do not allow your knees to rise more than 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the surface.
Tips
• Move across the pool with as few kicks as possible. Make it a contest
with a friend!
• Training: Incorporate this drill as part of practice. Try fivesets of 100 yards
with 30 to 45 seconds of rest between sets. This provides a measure for
improving power and efficienc .

20 STREAMLINE BREASTSTROKE KICK
Purpose
To further the development of your breaststroke kick.
Procedure
1. Start at the wall and take a deep breath.
2. Push off the wall and place your hands in a prone streamline position.
Keep your hands, shoulders, hips, and heels at the surface.
3. Slide for two seconds. Then perform the breaststroke kick with a three-
count hold between kicks (a, b). When you finish the kick, your hips
should be at the surface. The heels of your feet should just barely break
the surface of the water (c).
4. Keep your head tucked in under your arms. Slowly exhale to let your air
out and go as far as you can; then stop, breathe, and repeat.
Focus Points
• Keep your arms in a tight streamline and keep your head tucked in under
your arms.
• Finish each kick with a tight squeeze and make sure that your toes are
pointed.
• Each time you keep your feet together for a count of three is called a glide.
You’ll need to remember this for later drills.
• Keep your knees from drifting wider than shoulder-width apart.
Tips
• Have someone watch you to verify that you are squeezing the kick and
keeping your hips up at the end of each kick.
• Move across the pool with as few kicks as possible.
• Training: Incorporate this drill as part of practice. Try fivesets of 100 yards
with 30 to 45 seconds of rest between sets. This provides a measure for
improving power and efficienc .

21 BUTTERFLY KICK DECK DRILL
Purpose
To feel the body action of the butterfly st oke.
Procedure
1. Stand on the deck with your hands on your hips. Keep good back
posture at all times during this exercise; avoid rounding your back and
shoulders. Always look forward.
2. Begin by pushing your hips back and your chest forward while keeping
your back and legs straight. (The correct position will feel like you are
starting to lean over to get a drink from a drinking fountain.) Push your
hips as far back as you can while maintaining your balance (a).
3. Return your hips to a straight position. Push your hips forward, bend
your knees slightly, and keep your back slightly arched (b). Return to the
straight position.
4. After you are comfortable with the motions, start to blend them in a
smooth, continuous action. Try to feel your hips moving through a full
range of motion.
Focus Points
• Keep your neck flexibleso that you always look forward. Your chin should
be tucked in when your hips are forward and should stick out when your
hips are back.
• Keep a slight arch in your lower back at all times.
• At first, push the hips as far forward and as far back as possible. Then
speed up and move your hips just 2 to 4 inches (5 or 10 cm) forward and
2 to 4 inches back.
Tips
• Practice in front of a mirror to ensure that you are always looking forward.
• Do this drill in shallow water (about waist deep) and really feel how the
water moves.

22 MERMAID DOLPHIN KICK
Purpose
To feel the complete body action of the butterfl .
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Imagine yourself as a mermaid or merman swimming in the
sea.
2. Take a deep breath. Push off the wall on your front side under the surface.
Keep your hands down by your sides and look down at the bottom of
the pool. Do not use your arms at all in this drill.
3. Push downward with your forehead to start the whiplike, up-and-down
action of the kick (a). Keep the head angle changing but primarily look
down (b, c).
Focus Points
• Do the surface dive slowly. Feel your body slide into the deeper water.
• Keep your head moving at all times.
• Look down at the black line on the bottom of the pool. If you are looking
forward, your hips will not be able to create enough power for a strong
kick.
Tips
• Have someone watch you under the water to verify that you are not
looking forward.
• Use a monofin to help you get the body action of the kick

23 DOLPHIN DRILL
Purpose
To feel the body action of the butterfly st oke while at the surface.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Imagine yourself as a dolphin swimming on the surface of
the ocean. This drill has the same body action as the previous drill, but
you are at the surface.
2. Take a deep breath. Push off the wall on your front side along the surface.
Keep your hands down by your sides and look down at the bottom of
the pool (a). Only the back of your head will break the surface. Do not
use your arms in this drill.
3. Push downward with your forehead to start the whiplike action of the
kick (b). Keep the head angle changing but primarily look down. As you
push your forehead down, allow your hips to come up (c). Then allow
your feet to slide above the surface and begin to kick down (d). Your
head will begin to come back up to break the surface as you kick down.
4. Break the surface with your head and repeat.
5. Your body will “stitch” the surface of the water. Your head, back, hips,
and feet will all break the surface in progression with each kick. Keep
the motion fluid.
6. Go as far as you can with one breath; then breathe and repeat.
Focus Points
• Keep your head moving at all times.
• Look down at the black line on the bottom of the pool. If you are looking
forward, your hips will not be able to create enough power for a strong
kick.
• Remember to move with your forehead first
• Develop a steady rhythm.
Tips
• Stay relaxed and see whether you can make it all the way across the pool
without having to stop and breathe.
• Training: Incorporate this drill into your training by doing 10 sets of 25
(with 30 to 45 seconds rest between sets) as fast as you can while main-
taining excellent body action and control. This will help you get the feel
of the butterfly st oke for competition.

24 SUPERMAN DOLPHIN KICK
Purpose
To feel the body action of the butterflystroke with your arms extended out in
front of your body.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Imagine you are Superman and you are dolphin kicking
through the water. This drill will have the same body action as the previous
two drills, but your arms will be extended out in front of your body.
2. Take a deep breath. Push off the wall on your front side along the surface.
Keep your hands out in front of you while you look down at the bottom
of the pool (a).
3. Use your hands instead of your head to start the body action. Push
downward with your hands to start the whiplike action of the kick (b).
Keep your head angle changing along with your hands, but primarily
look down. As you push your hands down, allow your hips to come
up (c). Then allow your feet to slide above the surface and begin to kick
down. Your head will begin to come back up to break the surface as you
kick down.
4. Break the surface with your head and repeat.
5. Your body will “stitch” the surface of the water. Your hands, head, back,
hips, and feet will all break the surface in progression with each kick.

25 STREAMLINE DOLPHIN KICK
Purpose
To practice the body action of the butterfly st oke in streamline.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. (This drill should also be done without fins to develop the
skill.) Push off the wall and place your hands in a prone streamline
position with your arms above your head (a).
2. Perform the dolphin kick by pushing with your hands, then your
abdominal muscles, then your hips, then your knees, and finally your
feet up to the surface (b, c).
Focus Points
• Stay in streamline when you start the butterfly action
• Use your hips to provide the main power source for the kick. Bend your
knees just a little while using your hips to drive the motion. In the stream-
line do not let your head bob in relation to your arms. Your head should
remain relatively still and centered in line with the spine.
Tips
• Start off underwater and then gradually come to the surface. See if the
kick feels the same while performed underwater as compared to swim-
ming at the surface.
• Do slow, big, powerful kicks at first.Gradually build speed. As you get
faster, your kicks will be shallower and quicker.
• Training: Incorporate this drill as part of your kicking sets. Try 10 sets of 25
at 45-second intervals. Work on speed while you hold a tight streamline.

Purpose
To practice the body action of the butterfly st oke.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Push off the wall and float on your back with your arms
down at your sides.
2. Begin the dolphin kick by pushing your abdominal muscles up (a). Then
progressively push your knees and then your feet up to the surface,
creating a whiplike action beginning with the abdominal muscles (b).
Your hands and head may go up and down a little; that’s okay. Put one
hand above your head to protect it as you approach the wall.
Focus Points
• Push your abdominal muscles up above the surface on each kick.
• Power the motion of the kick using your hips (not the knees) and bend
your knees just a little.
Tips
• Start off underwater and then gradually come to the surface. See whether
the kick feels the same underwater as it does as you move up to the surface.
• Do slow, big, powerful kicks at first. Build speed late .

28 DOLPHIN TAIL WALK (VERTICAL DOLPHIN KICK)
Purpose
To feel the body action, speed, and power of the butterfly kick
Procedure
1. Imagine watching dolphins at a marine park. Picture dolphins as they
kick up above the surface and seem to walk backward on the surface
with their tails. Their bodies move back and forth quickly and powerfully
as they gradually move backward. You will attempt to imitate this
movement.
2. Put on fins. Push off the wall on your back with your feet deep, your
arms down at your sides, and your head above the surface. Use quick,
strong dolphin kicks to keep your head and shoulders above the water
as you gradually kick backward (a). This one is a challenge! You will
really feel your abdominal muscles (b).
Focus Points
• Feel your hips moving back and forth as quickly and powerfully as pos-
sible.
• Kick from your hips (not your knees) and bend your knees just a little.
Tips
• For an advanced version, keep your hands just above the surface at your
sides (b).
• To build great power, try the drill while wearing a weight belt.
• Training: Incorporate this drill as part of your vertical kicking sets. Stay
in one position and kick as high as you can, especially with the hands
above the surface. Try four sets of 20-second vertical kicking sprints at
30-second intervals.

Chapter 3
Sculling
By learning how to interpret sensations of moving pressure, swimmers of
average ability can acquire the subtleties of advanced stroke technique.
Talented swimmers coached in these skills will likewise achieve expertise
and better performance.
For effective arm action in all the strokes, you need to learn how to gen-
erate propulsion through the shape of your hands and forearms as you
move through the water. For many years, pulling paddles have been used
to increase the power of the arms in the strokes. If these paddles are used
with too much force, however, the swimmer runs the risk of injuring the
shoulder. Sculling drills may be the best and safest way to learn the propel-
ler-like propulsion methods that swimming scientists have long considered
the most effective.
The drills in this chapter provide practical ways to
• practice pulling action, lifting action, and the finish of all strokes;
• learn about the pitch, lift, and angles of attack (creating whirlpools
gives you direct feedback);
• improve your feel for the water; and
• strengthen your hands, forearms, and wrists.
By modifying your body position and the direction of your sculling,
you can feel how to apply pressure in the water and you can position your
fingers, hands, wrists, and forearms for the most effective movement. The
drills in this chapter offer a primer in the art of sculling. In addition, some
fun and challenging training recommendations are provided to improve
arm propulsion.

29 STANDING WHIRLPOOLS
Purpose
To develop the foundation for propulsive arm movement in all the strokes. This
drill presents the basic sculling action. The drills that follow use this basic action.
Procedure
1. Stand in shoulder-depth water. Extend one arm with your hand about 12
inches (30 cm) deep (a).
2. With your palm facing downward and your wrist strong, begin to trace a
figure eight on its side. Sweep up and out; then sweep down and in (b, c).
This is the basic sculling action.
3. Your figu e eight should be 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45 cm) wide. These
movements are short but strong.
4. Keep the pressure on the palm of your hand. Use enough pressure to
create a whirlpool at the surface.
5. Switch hands and repeat.
Focus Points
• Quickly change the angle of your hand as you move it back and forth.
• Keep your wrists strong.
• Rotate from your elbow.
• Feel the pressure on your hand and forearm.
Tip
Practice sculling with different hand shapes: a fist, two fingers out, finger
together, fingers sp ead, and fingers together with the thumb out

30 SWEEP IN AND SWEEP OUT
Purpose
To develop coordination in sculling with both hands and to improve your
instinct in the water.
Procedure
1. Stand in shoulder-deep water. Start with both arms extended in front of
you a little wider than shoulder-width apart and your hands about 12
inches (30 cm) deep.
2. Using the same action as in the previous drill, scull with the hands
moving in opposite directions at the same time. Sweep out with both
hands (a); then sweep in with both hands (b).
3. Start slowly and gradually move your hands more quickly to create two
whirlpools.
Focus Points
• Quickly change the angle of your hands as you move them through the
water.
• Keep your wrists strong.
• Rotate from the elbow.
• Feel the pressure on your hands and forearms.
Tips
• Practice sculling with different hand shapes: a fist,two fingersout, finger
together, fingers sp ead, and fingers together with the thumb out
• Move to deep water and see whether you can create the whirlpools at the
surface while you flutter kick and stay in a vertical position

Chapter 4
Backstroke
Even though most swimmers primarily swim freestyle in their practices, I
begin the process of developing the competitive strokes by introducing the
backstroke first. The fundamentals of the backstroke are similar to those of
the freestyle except that the face is not submerged in the backstroke; there-
fore, head-turning mechanics are unnecessary, and it is easier to breathe. In
addition, the arm stroke is performed with the arms out to the side of the
body. Both backstroke and freestyle require good hip rotation and excel-
lent kicking.
The backstroke is the only competitive stroke performed on the back.
Executing it requires technical skills and a high degree of comfort while
swimming on the back. In addition, swimmers must practice safely to pre-
vent injury.
The best backstrokers
• maintain excellent body position with their hips and torso up high;
• have a smooth, relaxed stroke recovery with their arms entering directly
in line with their shoulders;
• have excellent head control and keep the head steady;
• have good hip rotation, torso rolling, and shoulder lift;
• have flawless kicking; and
• pull through the water efficiently and with great power.
The drills presented in this chapter will help you improve all these fun-
damental aspects of your backstroke. In addition, training tips help you
incorporate these skills into your regular practice schedule.

42 BACKSTROKE RECOVERY ON DECK
Purpose
To isolate and emphasize the arm action of the backstroke recovery.
Procedure
1. Stand next to a wall that is taller than you are when your arms are
stretched over your head.
2. Position your body with your side to the wall so that your shoulder is 1
or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) from the wall (a). You will be using only the arm
next to the wall. Keep that arm close to the wall at all times during this
drill.
3. Start with your arm straight and your palm against your thigh. Lift your
arm up as if you were going to shake hands with an imaginary person in
front of you (b). Keep your arm straight.
4. Rotate your arm inward at the shoulder as your raise it. Keep your elbow
straight and turn your palm down. By the time your hand is as high as
your head, your palm should be facing down.
5. Continue to rotate your palm as you lift your arm. When your arm is
directly overhead, your palm should be facing the wall (c). Repeat this
movement several times. Begin slowly and gradually build up speed.
Focus Points
• Imagine painting a large arc with your fingers as you do this drill
• Perform this drill slowly and with great control.
• Stay close to the wall.
Tip
Practice at home in front of a mirror to verify that your arms recover directly
above your shoulders.

43 STREAMLINE BACKSTROKE KICK
Purpose
To practice full-speed backstroke kicking while maintaining correct body position.
Procedure
1. Repeat the Slow Flutter on Back drill and Streamline Back Flutter
Kick drill from chapter 2, but put on fins for more power. Hold a good
streamline and correct body position (a, b).
2. Begin to kick faster and more forcefully.
Focus Points
• Remember to float, st eamline, and kick.
• Keep your hands just under the water.
• Keep your toes pointed and your ankles relaxed.
• Boil the water but do not splash.
• Keep your head back so that your ears are under the water and are cradled
by your arms.
• Keep your abdomen up; feel the bottom of your rib cage on the surface.
Tips
• See how hard you can kick to boil the water as much as possible. Have a
boiling contest with a friend! Remember to boil, not splash.
• Training: This is a key drill to incorporate into the kicking sets that helps
to reinforce good body position and streamlining. Try 10 sets of 25 at
30-second intervals or 4 sets of 50 at 1-minute intervals. Senior-level
swimmers can do these sets without fins

44 ONE-ARM EXTENDED BACK KICK
Purpose
This drill is an intermediate step to help you move into the correct backstroke
position.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Push off the wall on your back with only one arm above your
head in a half-streamline position.
2. Position your extended arm with your palm facing up and your thumb
in. Straighten your elbow. Extend your arm forward from your shoulder,
close to but not quite touching the head. Keep your other arm down at
your side.
3. Use a flutter kick to move along the surface. Keep the bottom of your rib
cage up and keep your head steady (a, b).
Focus Points
• Keep your head stationary. Keep your ears level and just below the surface.
• Keep your shoulders steady.
• Control the position of your hand above your head so that your palm
faces up.
Tip
To ensure your shoulders are staying steady and your rib cage is high enough
during the drill, balance a cup on top of your chest, right at the bottom of your
sternum.

45 BACKSTROKE SIDE GLIDE AND KICK
Purpose
When we study how the body moves most effectively through the water during
the backstroke or freestyle, we notice that the best swimmers have a certain
degree of rotation in the long axis and that their bodies stay high in relation to
the surface of the water. Here is a simple explanation of how this works.
In chapter 1, you saw that the body has natural buoyancy and that some
people have better buoyancy than others. The best swimmers move through
the water with most of the body below the surface, but a good deal of the body
is above the surface, too. Humans are not designed to move through the water
as fishdo; we do not move completely underwater with our bodies in vertical
positions. The closest representation of the human body’s natural buoyancy
is a sailboat. If you have ever operated a good-sized sailboat, you’ll probably
recognize what I mean.
Much of the sailboat is actually underwater. As it moves through the water,
an interesting thing happens when the sails catch the wind just right: the boat
lifts and cuts through the water more easily. This usually happens when the
boat is at an angle. Likewise, swimmers can shape their body positions for the
freestyle and the backstroke at angles that give the body more lift, reduce drag,
and increase speed.
Procedure
When you are providing propulsion from a flutterkick, you can position your
body at an angle, giving it the appearance of a sailboat, for additional lift. For
most people this angle is about 45 degrees, but it can vary from one person to
another. It is known as the sailboat position or sailboat angle.
The key is to feel your body lift to the highest position possible while moving
through the water. A higher body position results in less drag, which makes it
easier to move through the water and swim faster.
1. Put on fins.Push off from the wall on your back and immediately shape
your body into the sailboat position. Allow yourself to glide as far as
possible while holding this position.
2. Add a slow flutter kick and continue to hold the sailboat position
Focus Points
• Keep your head straight.
• On one side of your body, feel your shoulder, your elbow, and the side of
your rib cage at the surface.

46 LATERAL BACKSTROKE KICK
Purpose
To establish the sailboat phase of the backstroke with control of your body and
hand positions. This drill is the most important one in the backstroke series.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Push off as you did in the One-Arm Extended Back Kick
drill.
2. Rotate your extended arm deeper in the water and move your body to
the sailboat angle as you kick (see the Backstroke Side Glide and Kick
drill). When your body is in the sailboat angle, you should feel your
shoulder, your elbow, and the side of your rib cage on one side at the
surface.
3. Rotate your extended arm so that your palm is vertical with the pinky
down and the thumb up. Your arm should be 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 cm)
below the surface.
Focus Points
• Keep your head stationary and in a straight alignment. Keep your ears
level and just below the surface.
• Feel your shoulder, your elbow, and the side of your rib cage at the surface.
• Keep the wrist of your extended arm straight.
Tips
• For the hand position, think of your thumb as a periscope and make sure
you keep the periscope in position to come up.
• Advanced variation: Use a freestyler hand paddle on the extended arm. I
like this hand paddle because of the skew, which allows the swimmer to
feel the correct alignment. No other hand paddle has this feature.
• Try this drill with your eyes closed and see whether you move in a straight
line.
• Try balancing a cup or water bottle on your forehead while you do this
drill to encourage a straight alignment.
• Training: This is an important drill to incorporate into the kicking sets.
As you increase the speed and intensity, this drill will help you findthe
right position for arm placement in the backstroke. Do four to eight sets
of 25, alternating arms after each set. Gradually increase your speed as
you improve your arm position. Senior-level swimmers can do this drill
without fins and with the f eestyler hand paddle.

47 SHOULDER ROLL
Purpose
To isolate and emphasize the shoulder rotation action of the backstroke.
Procedure
1. Put on fins; this drill requires strong kicking.
2. Float on your back and flutter kick with your arms down at your sides.
Keep your head position steady and slowly roll one shoulder up and
into the sailboat angle.
3. Pause so that you can feel your shoulder, your elbow, and the side of
your rib cage at the surface (a). Hold the position for a count of three.
4. Slowly roll your body to the other side (b). You should feel your rib cage
up at the surface the whole time you are rolling.
5. Continue rolling from one side to the other and back again. After you
pass the backstroke flags at the other end of the pool, put one arm above
your head so that you can finish safely at the wall. (The flags on either
end of the pool, called backstroke flags, are there to help you turn or
finish properly.)
Focus Points
• Keep your head steady.
• Roll slowly. It is not important how fast you do this drill but how well
you do it!
• Keep your kicking quick and constant.
Tips
• Advanced variation: Position your body vertically in deep water. Have
someone on the deck place his or her hands on both sides of your head
and hold you just above the surface. Work on rolling your shoulders back
and forth to create a washing-machine action.
• Training: Senior-level swimmers can do this drill without finsand work
on the timing of their shoulder rotation.

48 FLAG DRILL
Purpose
To emphasize the beginning of the recovery phase of the backstroke.
Procedure
1. Begin as you did in the Lateral Backstroke Kick drill (a).
2. After you have rolled your body to one side (keeping one arm above the
body and one at your side), hold the sailboat angle and lift the arm on
the same side as the shoulder that is up (b).
3. Keep your elbow and wrist straight and your thumb up and pinky down.
Slowly lift the arm just 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) above the surface of the
water. Then slowly lower the arm back to your side.
4. Roll to the other side and repeat (c, d).
Focus Points
• Keep your head steady.
• Roll slowly and then lift.
• Kick hard as you lift your arm so that your body can stay up.
Tip
Look down the top of your arm as you lift. Make sure that your arm is straight.

49 GUIDED ONE-ARM BACKSTROKE
Purpose
To emphasize the backstroke pulling action in combination with the recovery
and rolling actions.
Procedure
1. Put on fins.
2. Flutter kick in a lateral backstroke position with the extended arm right
next to the lane rope and your body in the sailboat angle (a). Hold this
position for a count of three. You use only the extended arm that is next
to the lane rope; the other arm stays down at your side.
3. Grab the lane rope. Gently pull your body along the rope (b) and complete
the pull-down at your thigh.
4. As you complete the pull, roll the shoulder of your pulling arm up so
that you are in the sailboat angle on the other side (c). Hold this position
for a count of three while you continue to kick.
5. Slowly recover the pulling arm by lifting it through the air (d). Your hand
travels in a large arc until it enters the water overhead. Rotate your arm
during the recovery so that your thumb comes out of the water first and
your pinky enters the water first. Your hand should enter the water next
to the lane rope with the periscope thumb up.
6. As your hand enters the water, roll the opposite shoulder up into the
sailboat angle. This completes one cycle.
7. Continue to repeat this cycle. Keep your arm extended in the water
above your head when you pass the flags so that you finish safely at the
wall. You should follow this pattern: 1, 2, 3, pull, roll, 4, 5, 6, recover, roll.
Focus Points
• You should roll back and forth into the sailboat angle.
• Stay close to the lane rope.
• Perform the drill slowly.
• Keep your kicking fast and strong.
Tip
Recite this pattern to yourself as you do the drill: 1, 2, 3, pull, roll, 4, 5, 6, recover,
roll.

50 CONTROLLED ONE-ARM BACKSTROKE
Purpose
To develop the complete backstroke action with control. This is the second key
drill in the backstroke series.
Procedure
Perform this drill exactly as you did the previous drill, but don’t use the lane
rope for pulling. The pulling action will be along an imaginary lane rope that
is about 1 foot (30.5 cm) deep.
1. Put on fins.
2. Kick in a lateral backstroke kicking position right next to the lane rope
with your extended arm next to the rope (a). Hold this position for a
count of three. You use only the arm that is extended next to the lane
rope; the other arm stays down at your side.
3. Pull under the lane rope along an imaginary lane rope (b) and complete
the pull-down at your thigh.
4. As you complete the pull, roll the shoulder of the pulling arm above the
surface (c). Hold this position for a count of three while you continue to
kick.
5. Slowly recover the pulling arm (d). Your hand should enter the water
next to the lane rope with the periscope thumb up.
6. As your hand enters the water, roll the opposite shoulder up. This com-
pletes one cycle.
7. Continue to repeat this cycle. Keep your arm extended above your head
when you pass the flags so that you finish safely at the wall. Remember
this pattern: 1, 2, 3, pull, roll, 4, 5, 6, recover, roll.
Focus Points
• You should roll from the sailboat angle on one side to the other.
• Stay within 2 inches (5 cm) of the lane rope.
• Keep your kicking fast and strong.
Tip
Recite this to yourself as you do the drill: 1, 2, 3, pull, roll, 4, 5, 6, recover, roll.

(a). Hold this position for a count of three.
2. Pull with both arms at the same time all way to your hips.
3. Recover both arms at the same time (b). Concentrate on feeling your
hands enter the water at the ten o’clock and two o’clock positions. After
your hands enter the water, hold this position (your arms stretched
overhead and your hands barely underwater) for a count of three (c).
4. Pull both arms at the same time and finish at your side (d). This completes
one cycle.
5. Continue to repeat this cycle. Keep your arms above your head when
you pass the flags so that you finish safely at the wall.
Focus Points
• Keep your body position steady. Avoid bouncing.
• Perform the drill slowly.
• Keep your kicking fast and strong.
• Make sure your hands enter the water at the ten o’clock and two o’clock
positions.
Tips
• Think of pulling on imaginary lane ropes that are close to you on both
sides.
• Advanced variation: Perform this drill with a pull buoy between your
legs while you keep your body steady.

52 L DRILL
Purpose
To emphasize the middle of the recovery phase of the backstroke while keep-
ing maximum buoyancy and to start coordinating the recovery with the pull
to emphasize timing and stroke rate.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Kick in a lateral backstroke position with your right arm
extended and your left arm down at your side (a) as you did in the Flag
drill.
2. Hold this position and kick for a count of five
3. Keep the right arm extended as you lift your left arm straight up to a
90-degree angle from the shoulder (L position). Hold this position and
kick for a count of five(b).
4. Continue recovering your left arm until your left hand enters the water
and touches your right hand.
5. Pull your right arm through the water and roll your shoulder and hips
until your right arm is down at your side. You are now in a lateral
backstroke kicking position with your right side up (c).
6. Repeat these steps using your right arm while your left arm stays
extended.
Focus Points
• Make sure you are in the sailboat position on one side.
• Perform the drill slowly and smoothly.
• Keep your kicking steady and strong.
Tips
• Keep your head steady as you perform this drill.
• Look at your hand above you when it is in the L position. Stay focused.

53 CONTROLLED TWO-ARM BACKSTROKE
Purpose
To develop the complete backstroke action with control and coordination in
both arms. This is the third key drill in the backstroke series.
Procedure
This drill is the same as the Controlled One-Arm Backstroke drill, but in this
drill you use both arms.
1. Put on fins. Kick in a lateral backstroke kicking position with your right
arm extended and your left arm down at your side (a). Hold this position
for a count of three.
2. Switch arms at the same time by pulling with your right arm and
recovering with your left arm (b) until you reach the lateral backstroke
kicking position with your left arm up and your right arm down (c).
Hold this position for a count of three.
3. Repeat the switch. This is one stroke cycle.
4. Continue to repeat this cycle. Keep your arm extended above your head
when you pass the flags so that you finish safely at the wall.
Focus Points
• Roll from one side to the other.
• Perform the drill slowly and smoothly.
• Keep your kicking fast and strong.
Tips
• Switch your arms at close to the same time. Imagine a teeter-totter: Let
your shoulders rock back and forth with that motion. Let your shoulders
lead the way. First rotate the shoulders and then rotate the arms.
• Training: To reinforce these mechanics, hold the lateral position on each
side for a count of six; do two sets of 25. Then do two sets holding for a
count of three and two sets holding for a count of one.

54 CONTINUOUS ONE-ARM BACKSTROKE
Purpose
To emphasize stroke control and body roll while focusing on just one arm. This
is the fourth key drill in the backstroke series.
Procedure
Perform this drill exactly as you did the Controlled One-Arm Backstroke but
without pausing between strokes.
1. Put on fins. Start in a lateral backstroke kicking position (a). You use the
arm extended above your head; the other arm stays down at your side.
2. Using a continuous action, pull and recover one arm (b-d). Concentrate
on excellent shoulder and body roll and a steady head position.
3. Keep one arm above your head when you pass the flags so that you
finish safely at the wall.
Focus Points
• Keep rolling from one side to the other.
• Perform the stroke smoothly. Do not pause at any point in the stroke.
• Keep your kicking fast and strong.
Tip
Pay attention your shoulders; rotate each one into the sailboat angle each time.
Remember to imagine that teeter-totter movement.

Purpose
To emphasize stroke control and body roll while coordinating your arms.
Procedure
Perform this drill exactly as you did the Controlled One-Arm Backstroke but
use both arms at the same time.
1. Put on fins. Kick in a lateral backstroke kicking position.
2. Using a smooth, continuous action, switch both arms at the same time (a).
3. Let your shoulders lead the arm action. Lift your shoulders to the sailboat
angle on the recovery. Do not pause at any point in the stroke.
4. Continue to repeat the cycle. Extend one arm above your head when you
pass the flags so that you finish safely at the wall (b).
Focus Points
• Keep rolling from one side to the other.
• Perform the stroke smoothly. Do not pause at any point in the stroke.
• Keep your kicking fast and strong.

56 BACKSTROKE FINAL ADJUSTMENT
Purpose
To practice the backstroke while focusing on the correct position of your hands
as they enter the water. Now that you have excellent shoulder and body roll
in the backstroke, you will be able to swim with what feels like a wider stroke.
Procedure
1. Your hands should feel as if they are entering the water at the ten o’clock
and two o’clock positions. This will feel deceptively easy, and if the
stroke is correct, it should be.
2. Swim a smooth, controlled backstroke (a, b). Concentrate on feeling
your hands enter the water at the ten o’clock and two o’clock positions.
You may also notice that the stroke moves a little quicker. This is okay.
Maintain your good shoulder roll, steady body position, and strong
kicking.
3. Have your coach or training partner stand on the deck at the end of
your lane to see whether your hands enter the water right above your
shoulders. Do not over- or underreach. The most common problem is
overreaching (when your hands enter past the line of the respective
shoulder, such as when your hand enters directly over your head). Make
adjustments as necessary.
Focus Points
• Make sure that your hands enter the water at the ten o’clock and two
o’clock positions.
• Don’t forget to maintain all the correct mechanics of the backstroke: steady
body position, quick and strong kicking, and a good shoulder roll.
Tips
• Swimming next to the lane rope is another way to check your arm entry
position. Your hand should enter the water right next to the lane rope.
• While swimming next to the lane rope, perform a few strokes with your
eyes closed to help you really feel the stroke.

Chapter 5
Freestyle
Freestyle is the fastest of the competitive strokes. In competition, however,
swimmers often try to speed up by moving their arms faster through the
air. They try so hard that their strokes deteriorate, slowing them down. To
move faster, swimmers must balance good technique with strong pulling
and kicking.
Efficiency is vital to swimming freestyle fast. In the past few years, much
has been learned about the way that the best swimmers in the world swim
freestyle. Sprinters tend to have straighter arms for a faster turnover and
higher stroke rate rather than a long stroke that focuses on distance per
stroke. Distance swimmers tend to have more of a front-quadrant stroke
that resembles the catch-up freestyle in some ways. New research supports
a shallower pull stemming from the elbow to improve the efficiency of the
stroke. The drag applied to the hand and forearm is much less than that
for the upper arm, so swimmers are trying to pull with a bent elbow under
the water while keeping the upper arm as close to the surface as possible.
The best freestylers
• maintain excellent head and body position with their bodies high out
of the water;
• have a smooth, relaxed stroke recovery with the elbows high;
• have excellent head control;
• breathe comfortably;
• have good hip rotation, torso rolling, and shoulder lift;
• have flawless kicking;
• pull through the water efficiently and with great power;
• catch the water with the elbow high during the catch phase; and
• pull all the way past the hip until the hand releases to the recovery.
The drills in this chapter will help you apply the characteristics of the
best freestylers to your stroke.

57 STREAMLINE FREESTYLE KICK, NO BREATH
Purpose
To practice full-speed freestyle kicking while maintaining a flatbody position.
Procedure
1. Start at the wall with fins on.
2. Take a deep breath, push off the wall, and place your hands in a streamline
position—nose down, with the hands, shoulders, hips, and heels at the
surface (a).
3. Slide for a couple of seconds and then start kicking with a quick, steady
flutter kick (b). Keep your toes pointed and in the water at all times. The
heels of your feet should just barely break the surface of the water. Your
hips should be right at the surface.
4. Keep your head tucked in under your arms. Slowly let your air out of
your nose and go about halfway across the pool. Then stop and repeat.
Focus Points
• Keep your arms in the streamline position. The arms should be behind
the head with the elbows locked in a tight streamline.
• Kick the water, not the air. In other words, avoid lifting your feet above
the surface of the water. While the splashing may look impressive, it does
nothing! Kick from the thighs and the ankles, not the knees.
• Keep your hips up.
Tips
• Try to position your head so that it just barely breaks the surface or sits
slightly below the surface. This positioning will help get you ready for
the freestyle drills.
• Do this drill with the snorkel.

58 ONE-ARM EXTENDED FREESTYLE KICK
Purpose
To help you transition into the sailboat angle. This drill is a novice to interme-
diate step.
Procedure
1. Put fins on. Begin by pushing off the wall on your front with just one arm
extended in a half-streamline position (a).
2. Positon your extended arm with the palm facing down. Your elbow
should be straight, and your arm should be extended forward from the
shoulder, close to but not quite touching the head.
3. Keep your other arm down at your side.
4. Use a flutter kick and move along the surface (b). Keep your shoulders
and hips up.
5. Keep your head steady.
6. Slowly let out your air as you go about halfway across the pool and then
stop. Repeat.
7. Add a freestyle side breath to continue performing the drill down the
pool.
Focus Points
• The head should remain stationary. Keep the ears level and just below
the surface.
• Keep your shoulders steady.
• Control the position of your extended hand so that the palm faces down.
Tip
Do this drill with the snorkel.

59 FREESTYLE SIDE GLIDE
Purpose
To establish the sailboat angle phase of the freestyle with control of the body
and hand positions. This is the most important drill of the freestyle series.
Procedure
1. Review the discussion in the Sailboat Angle drill in chapter 4. You will
focus on getting into the sailboat angle while on your front side.
2. Put on fins. Start by pushing off on your front. Have one arm extended
and begin flutter kicking(a).
3. Rotate the extended arm forward in the water and move the body to
the sailboat angle as you continue kicking. You should feel the shoulder
coming out of the water with the elbow and the side of the hip on the
other side all being at the surface. This position is the sailboat angle.
4. Rotate the extended arm so that the palm is horizontal, facing down. The
arm should be 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) below the surface (b).
5. Look straight down at the bottom of the pool. Only the back of your
head should be breaking the surface.
6. With a steady kick, go halfway across the pool without a breath. Stop
and repeat.
Focus Points
• Keep the head stationary and in straight alignment.
• Feel the shoulder, elbow, and side of the hip all on the same side at the
surface.
• Keep the wrist of the extended arm straight.
Tips
• For an advanced version, use a freestyler hand paddle on the extended
arm.
• Kick with your body right over the black line without letting the extended
arm move across the line.
• Try this drill with your eyes closed and see whether you move in a straight
line.
• Be sure to keep the head straight while rotating to the side glide position.
• Also, try this with the snorkel.

60 FREESTYLE SIDE GLIDE WITH BREATHING
Purpose
To add the breathing action of the freestyle and to continue to practice control
of the body position and head position. This is another key drill in the freestyle
series.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Push off the wall into the position described in the Freestyle
Side Glide drill. Hold the sailboat angle steady throughout this drill.
2. Begin kicking while looking down at the bottom with the back of your
head just barely above the surface (a). Hold this position for a count of
three. Be sure to blow a steady stream of bubbles out of your nose while
humming (hum bubbles).
3. Rotate your head to turn away from the extended arm. Turn the head
enough so that your mouth is at the surface and you can sneak in a
breath (b). Inhale.
4. Rotate your head back down so that you are looking straight down
again. Begin to blow bubbles as soon as your face reenters the water.
5. Continue to repeat the cycle.
Focus Points
• When your face is in the water, look straight down.
• Rotate at the neck to breathe. Keep the crown of your head in one spot.
Rotate the head; don’t lift it.
• Keep your body in the sailboat angle. Feel your shoulder, elbow, and hip
up at all times.
Tips
• Practice this drill on both sides so that you learn to be comfortable with
alternate breathing.
• Use a freestyler hand paddle on the extended arm to help you get the feel
of keeping your body on keel while you breathe.

61 SHARK FIN DRILL
Purpose
To establish the sailboat angle phase of the freestyle while holding a high elbow
recovery position and controlling the body and hand positions. This is a key drill
of the freestyle series. The drill develops core strength and helps you visualize
the recovery action of the arm movements.
Procedure
1. This drill begins the same as Freestyle Side Glide drill did—you must be
in sailboat angle to perform this drill correctly.
2. Put on fins. Start by pushing off on your front. Have one arm extended
and begin flutter kicking (a).
3. Rotate the extended arm forward in the water and move the body to
the sailboat angle as you continue kicking. You should feel the shoulder
coming out of the water with the elbow and the side of the hip on the
other side all being at the surface. This is the sailboat angle.
4. Rotate the extended arm so that the palm is horizontal, facing down. The
arm should be 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) below the surface (b).
5. Look straight down at the bottom of the pool with just the back of the
head breaking the surface.
6. After you are in the sailboat angle, lift the elbow high out of the water.
7. Reach the hand as far forward as you can while keeping the elbow as
high as possible (c).
8. With a steady kick, go halfway across the pool without a breath. Stop
and repeat.
Focus Points
• Keep the head stationary and in straight alignment.
• Feel the shoulder, elbow, and side of the hip all on the same side at the surface.
• Keep the wrist of the extended arm straight.
• Keep the elbow as high as possible.
• Reach the upper hand as far forward as you can.
Tips
• For an advanced version, use a freestyler hand paddle on the extended arm.
• Kick with your body right over the black line without letting the extended
arm move across the line.
• Be sure to keep the head straight while you rotate to the sailboat angle
and lift the hand out of the water.
• Keep the elbow as high as you can while putting the shark finhand as
far forward as possible.
• Also, try this with the snorkel.

62 ZIPPER DRILL
Purpose
To emphasize the proper mechanics for the arm recovery. This drill is excellent
for helping swimmers with chronic shoulder problems retrain their strokes,
and it usually corrects the problem. Most shoulder pain is caused by improper
mechanics, not a deficiency of a pain eliever!
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Hold a half board at the bottom with one arm and push off.
Move your body to the sailboat angle with your head in the breathing
position and kick.
2. Place your other arm down at your side so that the back of your hand
is against your thigh (a). Then grab an imaginary zipper between your
thumb and forefinger and pull the zipper up along your body until you
reach your armpit (b). Allow your wrist to flex
3. Your thumbnail should stay against your body, pointing toward the
middle of your body. Your palm should remain facing up. As you pull up,
your wrist should be relaxed and your elbow should come straight up.
4. After you complete the lifting action, slowly return the arm in the same
manner to the starting position. Continue to repeat this cycle. Be sure to
practice on both sides.
Focus Points
• Keep the body in the sailboat angle with your head in the breathing posi-
tion.
• Perform this drill slowly and with control.
• Lift the elbow straight up as you pull up.
• Be sure to attempt the keep the hand out of the water as long as possible
after the zipper action. Letting the hand hit the water right after the zip
will cause your hand entry to be too close to the head.
Tips
• Try doing this drill while facing a lane rope or high wall. Keep your hand
next to your body, which will force you to recover properly.
• Variation: Perform the drill without a kickboard.

63 FINGERTIP DRAG
Purpose
To emphasize the proper mechanics for the arm recovery. This drill is excellent
for helping swimmers with chronic shoulder problems retrain their strokes, and
it usually corrects the problem. This drill is similar to the Zipper drill in that it
helps with recovery. It also helps with extension. Maintaining the high elbow
during the recovery is important for efficient swimming
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Push off the wall. Move your body to the sailboat angle with
your head in the breathing position and kick.
2. Pull through the water with your other arm down at your side so that
the back of your hand is against your thigh (a). Next, lift the elbow out
of the water so that only the fingertipsare in the water. Then, move them
up along your body until you reach maximum extension out in front (b).
Allow your wrist to flex.
3. Your hands should travel under the elbow as they recover. Your palm
should start facing up as you begin the drag and finishfacing down when
the hand enters the water. As you lift the elbow and begin the drag, your
wrist should be relaxed and your elbow should come straight up.
4. After you complete the lifting action, slowly drag the hand out as far
as possible so that the hand enters out in front of the body. Continue to
repeat this cycle. Be sure to practice maintaining a high elbow on both
sides to maintain balance.
Focus Points
• Keep the body in the sailboat angle with your head still.
• Perform this drill slowly and with control.
• Lift the elbow straight up as you begin the drag.
• Be sure to drag out the hand as far as possible before entering the water;
a short hand entry will create needless drag.
Tips
• Try combining this drill with the Zipper drill to practice a keeping high
elbow in all parts of the stroke; we call this the Zipper Drag drill.
• You can also add the Fingertip Drag drill to the Catch-Up Freestyle drill.

64 CONTROLLED ONE-ARM FREESTYLE
Purpose
To isolate the proper mechanics of the freestyle, one arm at a time. This drill is
another important part of the freestyle series.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Hold a half board with one hand. Place your other hand
(which will be pulling) under the board with the knuckles against the
board. Start with your eyes looking down and position the back of your
head just barely above the surface. Your back and hips will be flat on
the surface. Kick while you hold this position for a count of three as you
blow bubbles (a).
2. After counting to three, begin to pull your arm down and roll your body
to the sailboat angle (b). As your hand passes under your shoulder, your
head should begin turning to the side to breathe.
3. Complete the pull in the stretch position, the same position you used
in the Freestyle Side Glide drill. As you finish the pull, the palm will
be facing up (c). Hold this stretched position for an additional count of
three.
4. Begin the zip-up action to bring your elbow up. As your hand reaches the
middle of your back, begin to return your head to the forward position
(d). (The hand should not pass in front of your face on the recovery.)
5. When the hand reaches the shoulder, rotate the hand forward so that it
can slice into the water just in front of the half board (e). Then, slide the
hand under the half board to complete the cycle (f). Practice with each
arm.
6. Repeat this cycle to yourself as you perform the drill: 1, 2, 3, pull, breathe,
stretch, 4, 5, 6, elbow, head, hand.
Focus Points
• Keep your head low so that the hips stay up.
• Keep the kicking steady.
• Concentrate on one step at a time.
Tip
For an advanced version, perform this drill next to a lane rope. Use the top of
the rope as a guide for your hand when recovering your arm. Let the fingernail
of your firstand middle fingersgently glide across the top of the lane rope as
if it were a piano.

65 THREE-COUNT SWITCH FREESTYLE, NO BREATH
Purpose
To develop the coordinated two-arm freestyle action with control of the timing.
This drill will also allow you to feel the complete extension of the freestyle
stroke. This is the next key drill in the freestyle series.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Start by kicking in the position described in the Freestyle
Side Glide drill with the left arm extended and the right arm down at
your side (a). The shoulder of your right arm will be above the surface.
Keep your eyes looking down and hold your breath. Kick in this position
for a count of three.
2. Switch arms at the same time by pulling with the left arm and recovering
with the right arm until you reach the position described in the Freestyle
Side Glide drill, with the right arm up and the left arm down (b–e). Kick
in this position for a count of three.
3. Repeat the switch. This completes one stroke cycle. Continue to repeat
this cycle.
4. Try to go all the way across the pool without breathing. Use the rhythm
of 1, 2, 3, switch, 1, 2, 3, switch.
Focus Points
• Keep your eyes down and hips up.
• Move from the sailboat angle on one side to the sailboat angle on the
other side.
• Perform the drill slowly and smoothly.
• Keep the kicking quick and strong.
• Keep the head still when rotating side to side.
Tips
• For an advanced version, perform this drill with a swimmer’s snorkel.
It works well because you can practice the control of the stroke without
having to move the head to breathe.
• You can also add the use of freestyler hand paddles—one on each hand.
• Variations: You can make it a progression from a six-count switch to a
three-count switch to a one-count switch to learn proper timing, exten-
sion, and great rotation.

66 SWIVEL FREESTYLE
Purpose
To add the dimension of breathing in the freestyle action with control of the
timing. This drill, the next key drill in the freestyle series, will help you feel the
complete extension of the freestyle stroke while breathing.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Start by kicking in the position described in the Freestyle
Side Glide drill with the left arm extended and the right arm down at
your side. The shoulder of your right arm will be above the surface.
Rotate your head to the breathing position. Kick in this position for a
count of three.
2. With a synchronized action of rotating the head through the water all the
way to the breathing position on the other side, switch arms at the same
time by pulling with the left arm and recovering with the right arm until
you reach the sailboat angle, with the right arm up and the left arm down
(a–c). Kick in this position for a count of three.
3. Repeat the switch and head rotation (d–f). This completes one stroke
cycle. Continue to repeat this cycle.
4. Use the rhythm of 1, 2, switch and breathe, 1, 2, switch and breathe.
Focus Points
• Move from the sailboat angle on one side to the sailboat angle on the
other side.
• Perform the drill slowly and smoothly.
• Rotate the head smoothly, keeping the crown of the head in the water.
• Keep the kicking quick and strong.
Tips
• For an advanced version, perform this drill with your eyes closed for a
few strokes and see whether you move in a straight line.
• You can also do this drill with freestyler hand paddles.
• Remember, this is only a drill, so you do not want to breathe to each side
after every stroke. Ideally, you want to swim with a still head position.

67 THREE-COUNT SWITCH FREESTYLE
Purpose
To develop the coordinated two-arm freestyle action with control of the timing.
This drill will also allow you to feel the complete extension of the freestyle stroke
with breathing to one side first.This is the next key drill in the freestyle series.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Start by kicking in the position described in the Freestyle
Side Glide drill with the left arm extended and the right arm down at
your side (a). The shoulder of your right arm will be above the surface.
Keep your eyes looking down and remember to blow bubbles. Kick in
this position for a count of three.
2. Switch your arms at the same time by pulling with the left arm and
recovering with the right arm until you reach the sailboat angle with the
right arm extended and the left arm down (b). As you switch, rotate your
head to breathe to your left (c). Kick in this position for a count of three.
3. Repeat the switch (d) and rotate the head so that your eyes are down.
This completes one stroke cycle. Continue to repeat this cycle for the
entire lap.
4. Change to breathing on the other side on the next lap. Get comfortable
breathing on either side.
5. The rhythm for this drill is 1, 2, 3, switch and breathe, 1, 2, 3, switch.
Focus Points
• Keep the crown of your head down and rotate your head when you
breathe.
• Move from the sailboat angle on one side to the sailboat angle on the
other side.
• Perform the drill slowly and smoothly.
• Keep the kicking quick and strong.
Tips
• Use freestyler hand paddles, which are specificallydesigned to enhance the
freestyle technique. You will get the feel of how to move the arm through
the water and how to recover properly.
• Try a few strokes with your eyes closed and see whether you stay in a
straight line.
• Variations: You can make it a progression from a six-count switch to a
three-count switch to a one-count switch to learn proper timing, exten-
sion, and great rotation.

68 THREE-COUNT SWITCH FREESTYLE
WITH ALTERNATE BREATHING
Purpose
To develop alternate breathing with the coordinated two-arm freestyle action.
This is the next key drill in the freestyle series. This drill is like the previous
drill, except that the timing is a little quicker and the breathing occurs on every
third stroke.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Start by kicking in the sailboat angle with the left arm
extended and the right arm down at your side. The shoulder of your
right arm will be above the surface (a). Keep your eyes looking down
and remember to blow bubbles. Kick in this position for a count of two.
2. Switch your arms at the same time by pulling with the left arm and
recovering with the right arm (b, c) until you reach the sailboat angle
with the right arm extended and the left arm down. As you switch, keep
your eyes looking down and slowly blow bubbles. Kick in this position
for a count of two (d).
3. Switch your arms at the same time by pulling with the right arm and
recovering with the left arm until you reach the position described in the
Freestyle Side Glide drill, with the left arm extended and the right arm
down (e). As you switch, rotate your head to breathe to your right. Kick
in this position for a count of two.
4. Repeat the switch and rotate the head so that your eyes are down. This
completes one stroke cycle. Continue to repeat this cycle for the entire
lap, breathing every third stroke.
5. Get comfortable breathing on either side.
6. The rhythm for this drill is 1, 2, 3 switch, 1, 2, 3, switch, 1, 2, 3 switch and
breathe.
Focus Points
• Keep the crown of your head down and rotate your head when you
breathe.
• Move from the sailboat angle on one side to the sailboat angle on the
other side.
• Perform the drill slowly and smoothly.
• Keep the kicking quick and strong.
Tips
• Use freestyler hand paddles.
• Try a few strokes with your eyes closed and see whether you stay in a
straight line.

69 CATCH-UP FREESTYLE
Purpose
To help you improve your arm extension during the breath so that your body
position stays high while beginning the recovery without having the extended
arm drop into the pull too soon.
Procedure
1. Begin by kicking in a streamlined position with the head down in the
water and exhaling (a).
2. Pull with your left arm while keeping the right arm extended in front (b).
3. As you are pulling with the left arm, roll your body to maximize extension
to the right. Continue to keep the right arm extended (c).
4. Return your body into streamline as you recover the left arm.
5. Bring your left hand to touch on top of your right hand (catch up) (d).
6. Then pull with your right arm while keeping the left arm extended in
front.
7. As you pull with the right arm, roll your body to maximize extension to
the left. Continue to keep the left arm extended.
8. Return your body into streamline as your recover the right arm.
9. Bring your right hand to touch on top of your left hand (catch up). Repeat.
10. When you need to breathe, you can breathe during the pull phase on
either side as needed.
Focus Points
• Keep the extended arm steady as you pull with the other arm.
• Keep your kicking rhythm steady at all times.
• While swimming, keep your head down in the water in a comfortable
position. The head is heavy, and lifting it higher could become tiring over
time. Try to keep the head in alignment so that the top of the head stays
underwater and the back of the head breaks the surface.
• Keep your front arm extended while breathing to keep your body position
higher in the water and make it easier to get air while you roll to breathe.
• Keep your strokes nice and smooth.
Tips
• Stay relaxed and perform this drill slowly so that you get the feel of the
breathing position.
• Be sure to practice this drill breathing on both sides so that you can be
more comfortable with alternate breathing, which can come in handy in
rough waters.
• Another way to practice this drill is to hold on to a small kickboard or
stick out in front.

70 CONTINUOUS ONE-ARM FREESTYLE
Purpose
To isolate the proper mechanics of the freestyle, one arm at a time. To execute this
advanced drill properly, you need to have excellent kicking and stroke control.
Procedure
The action of this drill is similar to that of the Continuous One-Arm Backstroke
drill. Remember to move your shoulders back and forth continuously from the
sailboat angle on one side to the sailboat angle on the other side.
1. Put on fins. Start in the position described the Freestyle Side Glide drill. Use
the extended arm in front and keep the other arm down at your side (a).
2. Using a smooth, continuous action, pull and recover the arm you are
working (b). Concentrate on excellent body roll and good head position
control. Reach and pause briefly when your arm is fully extended. Pause
briefly when you finish the stroke with your hand down at your side.
3. Breathe on the opposite side that you are pulling (c). Roll the opposite
shoulder so that it completely breaks the surface and reaches the sailboat
angle. Keep the hips up.
4. Time the breath so that you are breathing away from the arm that is
moving. The breath should start exactly as the stroking arm hits the
water.
5. Repeat the action for the other arm.
Focus Points
• Rotate from the sailboat angle on one side to the sailboat angle on the other.
• Keep the hips up as you rotate from one side to the other.
• Perform the stroke slowly and smoothly.
• Get full extension on every stroke. Reach all the way forward and pull
all the way back.
• Time the breath with key words: touch, roll, breathe.
• Keep the kicking quick and strong.
Tips
• Feel the shoulder and upper arm of your down arm come above the sur-
face when you extend the pulling arm forward.
• For an advanced version, try this drill with the freestyler hand paddle.

71 CONTINUOUS TWO-ARM FREESTYLE
Purpose
To emphasize stroke control and shoulder roll with the coordination of using
both arms.
Procedure
1. Perform this drill as you did the Continuous One-Arm Freestyle drill but
use both arms at the same time.
2. Put on fins. Start by kicking in a one-arm streamline position (a).
3. Using a smooth, continuous action, switch the arms at the same time (b).
Pause briefly at the point of full extension in the stroke (c). Be sure to
reach full extension and to complete each pull.
4. Continue to repeat the cycle (d). Use alternate breathing.
Focus Points
• Rotate from the sailboat angle on one side to the sailboat angle on the other.
• Keep the hips up as you rotate from one side to the other.
• Perform the stroke slowly and smoothly.
• Get full extension on every stroke. Reach all the way forward and pull
all the way back. Pausing brieflywhen you stretch and when you finish
is okay.
• Keep the kicking quick and strong.
Tips
• Use freestyler hand paddles.
• Try to slice your hands as they enter the water. Make sure they slice into
the water cleanly and notice whether you have very few air bubbles pass-
ing past your face as you swim. The fewer air bubbles you see, the better.
With younger swimmers, I like to use the analogy of slicing the cheese off
the pizza. This image helps with a shallow hand entry.
• Be sure to practice alternate breathing.

72 WINDMILL DRILL
Purpose
To emphasize having a straight-arm freestyle. Sprinters, like Nathan Adrian,
an Olympic gold-medalist, keep their arms straight during a sprint race. This
drill will help you practice straightening the arms, which is counter to what
most swimmers have learned. This drill is the final one in the f eestyle series.
Procedure
1. Perform this drill as you did the Continuous Two-Arm Freestyle drill but
keep the arms straight the entire time, especially at the elbow.
2. Put on fins. Start by kicking in a one-arm streamline position (a).
3. Using a smooth, continuous action, switch the arms at the same time (b).
Keep the arms straight through the pull all the way into the recovery (c).
Be sure to reach full extension and to complete each pull.
4. Continue to repeat the cycle.
5. Perform this drill without breathing. Breathing will stop the arm cycle
and slow the stroke rate, so you should do this drill only for short
distances, no more than a 25 yards or meters at a time.
Focus Points
• Rotate less than you would normally.
• Keep the hips up as you start the strokes, keeping the arms as straight as
possible the entire time.
• The stroke should cycle a little faster than normal.
• Get full extension on every stroke. Reach all the way forward and pull
all the way back.
• Keep the kicking quick and strong.
Tip
Variation: For a short distance, such as 15 yards (meters), spin the arms as fast as
possible and do not worry about technique. Focus on moving the arms quickly.
We call this drill the Spinner drill.

Chapter 6
Breaststroke
The breaststroke offers perhaps the greatest variability in style among the
strokes. There are almost as many styles of breaststroke as there are breast-
stroke coaches. In swimmers who have excellent upper-body strength rela-
tive to their kicking power, we see more emphasis on the arm action, a high
head lift, and an almost butterfly undulation in the body action. For swim-
mers who have most of their power coming from their legs, the head action
may be less prominent and the stroke may be flatter. Determining the best
style for each swimmer can be a bit of an art, and lots of variation is seen.
Some fundamentals, however, are common to almost all great breaststrokers.
The best breaststrokers
• reach an extended position, or glide, at least for an instant on every
stroke, assuring full extension and maximum efficiency;
• pull using an outsweep, insweep, and recovery, accelerating from
the beginning of the pull and not pausing until again reaching full
extension;
• keep their hips high throughout the entire stroke;
• complete the kick with a strong squeeze and pointed toes; and
• maintain good head control, always keeping the chin tucked in.
The breaststroke drills in this chapter will teach you these essential tech-
niques for enhancing your stroke. After mastering these fundamentals, you
can develop you own variation.

73 STANDING BREASTSTROKE PULLING ACTION
Purpose
To develop the correct mechanics for the breaststroke pull.
Procedure
1. Stand in shallow water so that your shoulders are just above the surface.
Position your arms out in front of you so that your thumbs are touching
and your palms are facing down and slightly out (a). Hold this position
for a count of three.
2. Begin the pulling action by sweeping your hands outward just under
the surface. You should reach a point where the fingers are still pointing
forward (before they begin to point out to the sides) and your hands
are apart about the length of one arm (b). In essence, you will shape
an equilateral triangle; your arms will be the sides, and the distance
between the hands will be the base.
3. Rotate the hands inward (c), begin to bend the elbows back, and sweep
your hands in (d). Your fingertips will “draw” the sides of the equilateral
triangle with the fingertips still facing forward. Sweep in until the
fingertips of both hands come together directly in front of and next to
your chest (e).
4. Shoot the hands forward together, just at or below the surface. Extend
your arms completely forward to the starting position (f). Repeat the cycle.
Focus Points
• Keep your body standing straight.
• Draw the triangle with your fingertips
• Perform this drill slowly and smoothly at first and then increase your
speed.
• Pause only in the starting position.
Tips
• Watch your hands as you perform this drill. You should always see them
in front of your shoulders.
• Use freestyler hand paddles. Focus on keeping the tip of the paddle facing
forward at all times as you sweep out and sweep in.

74 VERTICAL BREASTSTROKE PULL
Purpose
To develop the correct mechanics for the breaststroke pull. This drill enhances
arm pull speed and helps swimmers who tend to overpull or who have a slow
arm pull.
Procedure
Perform the Standing Breaststroke Pulling Action drill, but adding vertical
kicking in deep water.
1. Wearing finsin deep water, flutter kick in a vertical position with your
body straight and head above the surface. Touch thumbs in front of your
body, palms facing down and slightly out (a). Hold for a count of three.
2. Begin the pull by sweeping your hands outward just under the surface
(b). You should reach a point where the fingers are still pointing forward
(before they begin to point out to the sides) and hands are an arm’s
length apart. Try to shape an equilateral triangle with your arms as the
sides, and the span between your hands as the base.
3. Rotate the hands inward, begin to bend the elbows back, and sweep your
hands in (c). Your fingertips draw the sides of the equilateral triangle,
with fingertips still facing forward. Sweep in until the fingertips of both
hands come together in front of you near your chest (d).
4. Finally, shoot the hands forward together, just below the surface (e).
Extend your arms completely forward to the starting position. Repeat
the cycle.
Focus Points
• Keep your body straight.
• Pause only in the starting position.
• Accelerate and lift as you pull.
• As you sweep your arms in, lift your body above the surface, at least to
midchest height.
• Shoot your hands forward quickly.
Tips
• As you perform this drill, you should always see your hands in front of
your shoulders.
• Try using hand paddles. Keep the tip of each paddle facing forward at all
times as you sweep out and in.

75 QUICK HANDS BREASTSTROKE
Purpose
To isolate the proper mechanics of the breaststroke pull and to emphasize the
speed and lift needed for the stroke. Keeping your head up permits you to see
your arm pull in action and serves as a self-check. The drill is also more chal-
lenging with the head up.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Kick forward with your arms extended in front of your body,
head lifted, your eyes just above the surface, and your chin tucked in.
Hold your arms extended for a count of three. Then, pull and recover
quickly, using the breaststroke arm motion you practiced in the previous
two drills (a).
2. Get plenty of lift while pulling. Lift your shoulders higher above the
surface, but keep your chin tucked in (b). Return your head to the
starting position with the eyes just above the surface. Continue to repeat
the cycle (c).
3. The eyes should be just above the surface in the starting position. Keep
your chin tucked in while pulling. Look downward at about a 45-degree
angle, keeping the head angle steady.
Focus Points
• Be sure to breathe. Blow bubbles when your lower face is in the water so
that you can breathe in quickly when you pull.
• Keep your chin tucked in. Lift the body, not the chin.
• Really stretch and hold the extension for a count of three.
Tips
• When your arms are out in front, you create a window that you can look
through toward the bottom of the pool. Keep your chin tucked in so that
you can always look through the top of the window. Make sure that your
head angle remains steady.
• For an advanced drill, use freestyler hand paddles. Focus on keeping
the tip of each paddle facing forward at all times as you sweep out and
sweep in.

76 BREASTSTROKE PULL AND FLUTTER KICK,
HEAD DOWN
Purpose
To isolate the proper mechanics of the breaststroke pull and to emphasize the
speed and lift needed for the stroke while getting the body to a position with
as much buoyancy as possible. This drill is the same as the previous one, except
that you change your head position to start in the sliding position.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Kick forward with your arms extended in front of your
body, with your eyes down, the back of your head just above the surface,
and your chin tucked in. Hold your arms extended for a count of three.
Then, pull and recover quickly, using the breaststroke arm motion you
practiced in the previous two drills (a–c).
2. Get plenty of lift while pulling. Lift your shoulders higher above the
surface but keep your nose down and your chin tucked in. Return
your head to the starting position with the eyes just above the surface.
Continue to repeat the cycle.
3. The eyes should be looking straight down in the starting position. Keep
your chin tucked in while pulling. Look downward right into the surface
of the water when you pull and keep the head angle steady.
Focus Points
• Be sure to breathe. Blow bubbles when your face is in the water so that
you can breathe in quickly when you pull.
• Look down, look down, look down! You can still breathe without having
to look forward.
• Keep your chin tucked in. Lift the body, not the chin.
• Really stretch and hold the extension for a count of three. Feel your hips
come up to the surface when you extend.
Tip
For an advanced drill, use freestyler hand paddles. Focus on keeping the tip of
each paddle facing forward at all times as you sweep out and sweep in.

77 PULL, BREATHE, KICK, GLIDE
Purpose
To integrate the breathing and kicking phases of the breaststroke so that you can
feel the glide created in the power phase of the kick. Review the breaststroke
kicking drills from chapter 2 before embarking on this drill.
Procedure
1. Hold the bottom edge of a kickboard with the fingers on top and the
thumbs wrapped around underneath. Start by pushing off with your
nose down and your head barely breaking the surface. Your arms should
be completely extended, and your shoulders, hips, and heels should all
be at the surface. Point your toes (a).
2. After you push off the wall, hold the slide position for a count of three.
Be sure to blow bubbles the whole time that your face is in the water.
3. Lift your head up so that your chin is on the surface (b). Your chin should
be tucked in, and your eyes should be directed downward. Inhale.
4. As you lower your head back into the water, begin your kick by bringing
your heels in and then rotate the toes out (c).
5. As your head comes back into position in the water, kick out and squeeze.
You will be kicking into the slide position (d).
6. Exhale while your face is back in the water (e). Hold the slide position for
a count of three and then repeat the cycle.
Focus Points
• Concentrate on this pattern: breathe, kick, slide.
• Feel how your body slices through the water when you kick and then slide.
• After you finish the slide, lift your head firs
• Feel your hips and heels return to the surface during the slide.
Tips
• Move across the pool with as few kicks as possible and determine your
average number of kicks.
• For a variation, take only one breath for every two or three kicks to help
you develop the feel for the slide.
• Try this workout set: Do three 100s kicking, striving for the fewest number
of kicks for each 100. This workout is the best way to develop the power
of the breaststroke.

78 DOUBLE GLIDE BREASTSTROKE
Purpose
To develop the timing for the breaststroke and to emphasize the glide portion
of the stroke. This drill is especially useful with new swimmers and with swim-
mers who have timing issues that need to be corrected.
Procedure
1. Review gliding. Push off the wall with your nose down, in a streamline.
Feel your hands, shoulders, hips, and heels at the surface. Take a breath
before you push off and then slowly exhale when your face is in the
water. Hold the glide for a count of six.
2. Insert one stroke in between two glides. Push off from the wall and slide
for a count of three. Then, use this pattern to do one stroke: pull (a),
breathe (b), kick (c), glide. Glide for another count of three and stop.
3. Practice this drill until the stroke becomes fluid and the glide position is
established quickly after the stroke.
Focus Points
• Be sure to have your nose down on the glide portions.
• Keep your chin tucked in as you lift and breathe.
• Recover your hands high so that you can return to the glide position
quickly.
Tips
• Measure the distance you travel when you only glide for a count of six.
Make sure that when you add a stroke of breaststroke, you go much farther.
• Make a game of seeing how far you can go with the two glides and one
stroke.

79 CONTROLLED BREASTSTROKE
Purpose
To emphasize control along with the proper timing and extension for the
breaststroke.
Procedure
1. In this drill, you practice the breaststroke with one pull for each kick
and glide, one after another (a–d). Follow this pattern: pull, breathe, kick,
glide. Hold each glide for a count of three.
2. Keep your nose down on the slide. On the slide, the back of your head
should be at the surface.
3. Count the number of strokes per lap. You should strive for the fewest
number of strokes with the three-count glide timing.
Focus Points
• Maintain an even rhythm.
• Hold the glide for a count of three on each stroke.
• Keep the pull quick and get plenty of lift.
• Control the head and body position.
Tip
To get closer to the timing needed for the racing stroke, gradually reduce the
length of time that you hold the glide position. The shorter the race is, the quicker
the glide should be; the longer the race is, the longer the glide should be. Here
are the glide times to shoot for in races:
• For the 200, hold for a count of two or three.
• For the 100, hold for a count of one or two.
• For the 50, hold for a count of one.
Coaching note: After the swimmer masters the stroke with consistent head
control, the head angle can be modifiedto promote optimum body position on
the glide. Keep in mind that the breaststroke allows a lot of individual variation.

80 TWO KICKS TO ONE PULL
Purpose
To develop the proper timing and extension of the breaststroke. This is a supple-
mental drill for breaststroke.
Procedure
The kicking action is the same as the one you used in the Controlled Breaststroke
drill. You now add the pulling action to every other kick (a–f).
1. Follow this pattern: pull, breathe, kick, slide, and then kick, slide. Hold
each slide for a count of three.
2. Keep your nose down and your eyes looking down at the bottom. On the
slide, the back of your head should be at the surface.
Focus Points
• Kick with an even rhythm.
• Keep your hands in a steady position when not pulling. Locking the
thumbs helps.
• Keep the pull quick and get plenty of lift.
• Control your head position.
Tips
• Keep track of the number of kicks you take each lap. Determine your
average. Try to decrease the number each time you practice this drill.
• Use this drill as part of your warm-up before a race to help you feel how
you slide through the water after each kick.
• Advanced: To help with breath and stroke control, do the same drill with
three kicks for each pull. We call this drill the Triple Kick Breaststroke drill.

81 BREASTSTROKE PULL WITH DOLPHIN KICK
Purpose
To emphasize the hip action needed for the different dolphin breaststrokes by
combining the breaststroke and the butterfl . Not all swimmers will feel com-
fortable with this technique, which uses more of a dolphin action with the hips.
This drill is not essential, but it can be effective for many swimmers, depending
on their strengths and weaknesses.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Start on your front by dolphin kicking in a streamline position
(a). Take a breaststroke pull and breathe while you pull (b).
2. As you recover, drive your head down into the water, push your hips up,
and then finish with the downward part of the dolphin kick. Be sure to
stretch your arms out far in front of you (c). As you kick down, begin to
pull again. Continue to repeat.
Focus Points
• Stretch forward with your arms.
• Get your hips and legs up on every kick.
• Keep the pulling action quick.
• Try to stay up fairly high and resist going too deep under the surface.
Tips
• To get a better sense of the proper rhythm, try breathing on every other
pull or every third pull.
• The rhythm of this drill will vary depending on your ease with the dolphin
kick. If you are comfortable with this action, the rhythm can be quite quick.
• Advanced: Take off the fins.Alternate between one dolphin kick and one
breaststroke kick as you maintain the breaststroke pulling action. Work
on getting a consistent rhythm even with the different kicks.

82 OVER THE BARREL BREASTSTROKE
Purpose
To develop and practice the wave body action of the breaststroke during the
recovery. This drill also helps to correct low hips that create drag and impede
the glide. Many outstanding breaststrokers have an undulation in their breast-
stroke similar to that of the dolphin motion. A dolphin action of the body is
legal in breaststroke as long as the feet only rise during the motion and do not
kick downward.
Procedure
For this drill, you want to imagine that you are moving the body cleanly over
a barrel that is barely submerged, just below the surface of the water.
You basically do the same arm action and kick that you used in the Standing
Breaststroke Pulling Action drill and Vertical Breaststroke Kicking drill. The
difference now is that during the recovery of the breaststroke, you are trying
to get the hands and hips over the barrel.
1. Push off the wall at the surface in a glide position.
2. The pull remains the same as the pull for the normal breaststroke: out
sweep, in sweep, recover (a).
3. As you begin to move the hands out in front to begin the glide, you want
to get your hands and then your hips over the barrel (b).
4. Getting the hips over the barrel adds the dolphin undulation into the
breaststroke (c).
5. As you continue to glide through the water, you want your body to
remain at the surface (d).
Focus Points
• Get the hips up and over the barrel.
• Hold the glide position until the dolphin undulation ends and you can
glide through the water.
• The glide portion begins as the breaststroke kick finishes
Tip
Practice this drill until the dolphin undulation begins to feel like part of your
normal stroke.

83 TENNIS BALL BREASTSTROKE
Purpose
To correct improper head and eye position in the breaststroke. Your head should
stay in line with your spine as much as possible during the breaststroke, espe-
cially the glide. You need to keep the chin tucked in close to the chest during
the breath of the breaststroke. This drill keeps the head in the correct position.
Procedure
1. Start by placing a tennis ball under your chin. Squeeze the ball between
your chin and your chest.
2. Push off the wall in a glide position (a).
3. Swim normal breaststroke while holding the tennis ball under the chin (b).
4. Attempt to swim without dropping the ball (c).
Focus Points
• Keep the head in line with the spine.
• Try to keep the ball in place.
• In both the stroke and the glide, the ball should stay tucked under the chin.
Tips
• Hold the tennis ball in place and glide as long as possible while maintain-
ing the correct head position.
• Variation: Use the tennis ball when performing other breaststroke drills
such as the Quick Hands Breaststroke drill and the Breaststroke Pull With
Dolphin Kick drill.

Chapter 7
Butterfly
When performed correctly, the butterfly is probably the most graceful
and beautiful of all the strokes. But, it is also the most difficult stroke for
swimmers to master. The butterfly requires the most arm strength to lift
the body above the surface, and getting the proper timing can require
considerable practice.
To learn to swim butterfly well, the best approach is to do the drills at
short distances while maintaining excellent stroke technique. This idea also
translates to training, because maintaining good technique during training
sets is better than allowing the quality of the stroke to deteriorate. Repeating
good-quality butterfly swimming sets up proper muscle memory and effi-
cient swimming during races. Be patient. With consistency of good technical
execution, you will make great progress with your butterfly!
The best butterfliers
• have excellent serpentine body action and move through the water
with a fluid wave action;
• have strong kicks, generating power from the hips;
• have good head position, looking primarily down and keeping the chin
tucked in while breathing;
• recover their arms with the elbows straight and thumbs down; and
• perform two dolphin kicks for every one butterfly stroke.
The following drills will help you achieve these fundamentals in your
strokes as well as excellent timing.

84 MERMAID DRILL WITH BREATHING
Purpose
To feel the body action of the butterflystroke while at the surface. This drill is
a modificationof the Dolphin drill from chapter 2, and it is a key drill in begin-
ning the butterfly series
Procedure
1. This drill has the same body action you used in the Dolphin drill (chapter
2), except that you add breathing in sync.
2. Imagine yourself as a dolphin swimming at the surface on the ocean.
3. Put on fins. Take a deep breath. Push off the wall on your front side
along the surface, keeping your hands down by your sides and looking
down at the bottom of the pool. Just the back of your head will break the
surface (a). Do not use your arms on this drill.
4. Use your head to start the body action. Push downward with your
forehead to start the whiplike action of the kick (b). Keep the head angle
changing, but primarily look down. As you push your forehead down,
allow the hips to come up (c). Then allow your heels to slide above the
surface and begin to kick down (d). Your head will begin to come back
up to break the surface as you kick down.
5. Break the surface with your head and repeat.
6. Your body will “stitch” the surface of the water. Your head, then your
shoulders, then your hips, and finallyyour heels will break the surface
in progression with each kick. Keep the motion fluid. You will break the
surface in the following pattern: head, shoulders, hips, and heels.
7. Go as far as you can with one breath, breathe, and then repeat.
8. Then work on breathing every third kick with a consistency of rhythm.
9. After you breathe, bring your head into the water first—fo ehead first
Focus Points
• Be sure to keep your head moving at all times.
• Look down at the black line on the bottom of the pool. If you look forward,
your hips cannot create enough power for a strong kick.
• Remember to move with your forehead first
• Develop a steady rhythm.
Tip
Work on being able to breathe in sync with this drill, once every three kicks.
This breathing pattern will help you when you get to the other butterflydrills.

85 SUPERMAN FLY WITH BREATHING
Purpose
To develop the feel of the body action of the butterfly while in the extended
position and to set up the body position for the pulling action of the stroke.
Procedure
This drill is the same as the previous drill, except that your arms are extended
out in front.
1. Put on fins. Stretch your arms out in front with your hands shoulder-
width apart, elbows straight, palms facing down and out at about 45
degrees, and shoulders relaxed.
2. Inhale deeply. As you exhale, push off the wall on your front side along
the surface, keeping your hands stretched out in front of you and looking
down at the bottom of the pool. Just the back of your head will break the
surface (a). Your arms should stay extended throughout the drill with no
pulling or sculling action.
3. Use your head to start the body action. Push downward with the
forehead to start the whiplike action of the kick (b). Keep the head angle
changing, but primarily look down. As you push your forehead down,
allow the hips to come up (c). Then allow your heels to slide above the
surface and begin to kick down. Your head will begin to come back up to
break the surface as you kick down.
4. Break the surface with your head and repeat.
5. Your body will “stitch” the surface of the water. Your head, then your
shoulders, then your hips, and finallyyour heels will break the surface
in progression with each kick. Keep the motion fluid. You will break the
surface in the following pattern: head, shoulders, hips, and heels.
6. Go as far as you can with one breath, breathe, and then repeat.
7. Then work on breathing every third kick with a consistency of rhythm.
8. After you breathe, bring your head into the water first—fo ehead first
Focus Points
• Keep your head moving at all times.
• Look down at the black line on the bottom of the pool. If you look forward,
your hips cannot create enough power for a strong kick.
• Remember to move with your forehead first
• Develop a steady rhythm.
Tip
Work on being able to breathe in sync with this drill, once every three kicks, to
help you when you get to the other butterfly drills

86 SETUP OF BUTTERFLY DEVICE
Purpose
To set up a teaching tool that can safely enhance teaching the proper body
action of the butterfl .
Procedure
Over the years, I have used all kinds of tools to teach the butterflyaction. The
following simple invention seems to work well and helps to correct sunken hips
and inverted butterfly st okes.
Here’s what you’ll need to make your own butterfly device:
• A 9-foot (2.7 m) section of quarter-inch (65 mm) nylon rope
• A pair of pliers
• Two short bungee cords
• A hollow, spongy water noodle with a smooth surface
1. Pass the rope through the middle of the noodle so that you have an even
amount of rope on each end.
2. Tie a cinch knot on each side of the noodle so that the knot is close to the
noodle and keeps the noodle from sliding in either direction.
3. Tie a loop knot on each end of the rope.
4. Attach one end of a bungee cord on each loop and clamp down using
some pliers. Now the butterfly device is ready for attachment.
5. Place the device perpendicularly across a lane by hooking the bungee
cords on the cable of the lane rope. Put it about 6 yards (5.5 meters) away
from the wall.

87 OVER THE BARREL WITH DEVICE
Purpose
To develop the undulation and wave body action of the butterflywith the lift
of the arm pull. This drill also helps to correct the inverted butterflyaction that
makes you drop your hips.
Procedure
For this drill, you want to imagine moving your body cleanly over a barrel that
is barely submerged just below the surface of the water.
1. Position the butterfly device across the lane about 6 yards (5.5 meters)
away from the wall. You can also place some sort of marker (such as a
diving brick) directly under the device on the bottom.
2. Put on fins. Start at the wall facing into the lane.
3. Push off underwater on your front in the Superman flyposition—about
2 or 3 feet (60 to 90 cm) deep. Start your dolphin kicking action (a).
4. When you get close to the butterfly device, start to angle yourself upward
so that your hands are headed right for the device and your head breaks
the surface just in front of the device (b, c).
5. Just as your hands almost touch the device, pull your arms down as hard
as you can, all the way to your thighs. Create as much power as you
can to lift your body over the noodle as cleanly as possible—preferably
not even touching it. Go over the noodle headfirst and then curl your
forehead down so that your forehead enters the water first. Follow with
the hips and finally the legs (d, e).
6. After your body clears the noodle, kick downward with a dolphin kick (f).
7. Kick a couple more dolphin kicks while underwater and then stop.
Focus Points
• Be sure to start deep enough underwater so that you can create the neces-
sary power from your pull.
• Breathe quickly.
• Remember to enter forehead first after you clear the noodle
• Relax your legs as you clear the noodle and then kick after you clear it.
Tip
Practice this drill until you can go over the noodle smoothly and easily.

88 POP AND STOP
Purpose
To develop power from the arm pull along with the timing of the body action
of the butterfl .
Procedure
This drill is the same as the Over the Barrel With Device drill, except that you
don’t use the device and you repeat the action down the lane.
1. Put on fins. Start at the wall facing into the lane.
2. Push off underwater on your front in the Superman flyposition—about
2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 cm) deep. Start your dolphin kicking action.
3. Do three or four dolphin kicks underwater and then start to approach
the surface. When you get close to the surface, imagine the butterfly
device being there. Start to angle yourself upward so that your hands
are headed for the surface.
4. Just as your hands almost touch the surface, pull your arms down as
hard as you can, all the way to your thighs. Create as much power as you
can so that you can lift your body over the imaginary noodle as cleanly
as possible (a). Break the surface headfirst and then curl your forehead
down so that your forehead enters the water first (b). Follow with the
hips and finally the legs (c).
5. Your hands should pop out of the water past the hips. The hands stop
there; they do not recover around the side.
6. After your body clears the surface, kick downward with a dolphin kick.
7. Kick a couple more dolphin kicks while underwater, perform an under-
water recovery, and extend your arms in front again.
8. Repeat the sequence down the lane.
Focus Points
• Start far enough underwater so that you can create sufficientpower from
your pull.
• Breathe very quickly.
• Enter forehead first after you b eak the surface.
• Relax your legs as you break the surface and then kick after your hips
reenter the water.
Tip
Be relaxed underwater, and then explode through the surface with great power
from your pull.

89 STANDING BUTTERFLY ARM ACTION
Purpose
To develop proper mechanics of the arm stroke, particularly the recovery and
entry.
Procedure
The most common fault in the butterflyarm stroke is the hugging recovery. It
occurs when the arms recover with the thumbs turned upward and the palms
facing forward—just like giving a hug. Recovering this way makes the stroke
less effective. This drill works to eliminate that type of entry.
1. Lean forward a little, bending at the waist. Place your hands on your
knees. Raise your arms so that the backs of the hands (knuckle side) are
turned inward (a).
2. Simultaneously sweep both arms outward to about twice shoulder-width
apart. Bend the elbows a little and rotate the hands inward to press back
toward the waist (b). Continue to sweep the hands back, passing by the
hips.
3. The arms will continue to press back until they are straight back and
the palms are facing up (c). At this point, the hands should be as close
together as possible.
4. Begin the recovery phase by first relaxing the wrists and turning the
arms so that the wrists lead the motion and the thumbs are pointing
downward and back.
5. Keeping the elbows straight and the arms level, move the arms forward
until they are directly in front of each shoulder (d). This action completes
the cycle.
Focus Points
• Maintain strength in the wrists during the pulling phase and keep them
straight.
• Finish the pull with the palms facing up.
• Relax the wrists on the recovery.
• Let the wrists lead the recovery; the thumbs are pointing downward and
back.
• Keeps the thumbs down and the elbows locked during the recovery.
Tips
• Practice this drill slowly.
• Try practicing this drill in the water while standing up with your shoulders
just above the surface.

90 POWER FLY
Purpose
To add the arm pull and recovery to the butterfly body action
Procedure
This drill has the same action as the previous drill, but you use no device and
you continue repeating the pull and recovery down the length of the pool.
1. Put on fins. Start at the wall facing into the lane.
2. Push off underwater on your front in the Superman flyposition—about
2 to 3 feet (60 to 90 cm) deep (a). Start your dolphin kicking action. Do
three or four dolphin kicks underwater and then move toward the
surface to breathe.
3. Just as you reach the surface with your hands, pull with both arms to lift
your body (b). Breathe when you reach the peak of your lift (c). As you
finish the pull and begin the butterfly recovery with the arms, return
your head down into the water, entering forehead first
4. By the time you reach the dive, your arms are in front of you again and
your head is down. Lock the thumbs up again right away. Get the hips
up (d).
5. Finish the stroke with a strong kick. Look down while kicking under the
water.
6. Repeat with three or four dolphin kicks underwater. Then, come to the
surface and repeat the sequence. The sequence will now be pull, breathe,
dive, kick.
Focus Points
• Remember this sequence: pull, breathe, dive, kick.
• Look down while kicking under the water.
• Get your forehead into the water first after b eathing.
• After breathing, get your hips up above the surface.
Tips
• Perform this drill by going across the width of the pool over alternate loose
lane ropes. Begin to pull just as you reach the lane rope. Do not touch the
rope with your arms; swim over it. This drill is fun and gives you good
practice. Try to touch the lane rope as little as possible.
• Training: If you are a beginning swimmer who is just learning or develop-
ing the butterfl , focus on performing this drill until you develop sufficien
strength and stamina to swim butterfly p operly for 25 yards (meters).

91 ONE-ARM BUTTERFLY
Purpose
To transition to the continuous body action of the butterflyat the surface while
gradually incorporating the arm action.
Procedure
1. Put on fins. Keep one arm out in front of you at all times and use the
other arm to pull (a).
2. Stay on the surface and keep the rhythm of pull, breathe, dive, kick in a
continuous fashion.
3. Breathe to the side of the pulling arm (b, c). Briefly lock the thumbs each
time you dive until you feel the kick.
4. Relax and go slowly. Look down when you dive. Lift up the hips after
breathing (d).
5. Repeat the cycle for the other arm.
Focus Points
• Maintain the rhythm: pull, breathe, dive, kick.
• Look down after you breathe.
• Lift up your hips after breathing.
• Lock your thumbs each time until you feel the kick.
Tip
Alternate arms every lap and then every four strokes.

To continue the transition to a complete butterfly by focusing on the body action.
Procedure
This drill combines the action of the One-Arm Butterflydrill with the two-arm
recovery.
1. Put on fins.
2. Stay on the surface and concentrate on maintaining the rhythm of pull,
breathe, dive, kick in a continuous fashion.
3. First, take two strokes (pull and recovery) with one arm (a), then two
strokes with the other arm (b), and finally two strokes with both arms (c).
Continue to repeat this cycle.
4. Try to breathe every other stroke. Breathe straight ahead when taking
the two-arm stroke; breathe to the side when taking the one-arm stroke.
Lock the thumbs up on each stroke when you dive until you feel the kick.
5. Relax and go slowly. Lift up the hips on each stroke as your hands come
together in front.
Focus Points
• Concentrate on the rhythm: pull, breathe, dive, kick.
• Look down and lift up your hips as your hands come together.
• Lock your thumbs each time until you feel the kick.
Tips
• See how slowly you can do this drill with control. Try to be smooth.
• Training: The following training set can help build stamina and good
technique. Do four sets of 75 in a butterflydrill series. The first25 is 3 +
3 + 3 of this drill, the second 25 is 2 + 2+ 2, and the final 25 is 1 + 1 + 1

93 CONTROLLED BUTTERFLY
Purpose
To complete the transition to a controlled butterflywith excellent rhythm. The
emphasis remains on the body action.
Procedure
This drill eliminates the one-arm action of the previous drill.
1. Put on fins. Use both arms for every stroke. Stay on the surface and
work on keeping the rhythm of pull, breathe, dive, kick in a continuous
fashion (a, b).
2. Try to breathe every other stroke. Lock your thumbs up briefly on each
stroke when you dive. Relax and go slowly. Lift up your hips on each
stroke as your hands come together.
3. As you become stronger, try using this rhythm: reach, kick. Your arms
entering the water is the reach. Your feet kicking down is the kick (c). The
timing between the reach and the kick should be even.
Focus Points
• Keep a nice, flowing hythm: pull, breathe, dive, kick.
• Eventually use this rhythm: reach, kick.
• Look down after each breath.
• Lift up your hips on each stroke.
• Lock your thumbs on each stroke until you feel the kick.
Tip
Stay relaxed. Let the stroke technique do the work for you. You may notice
that as you swim a little faster, a second kick in the middle of each stroke will
usually occur naturally. In doing this drill, however, you don’t need to focus on
the second kick. For most swimmers, this second kick is a minor kick that gives
balance to the rhythm of the stroke. For some, the second kick can become very
strong. The best approach is to focus first on a nice, fluid motio

Open-Water
Swimming
Open-water swimming has become increasingly popular. But for those who
do not have experience with open water, swimming in natural bodies of
water can be both scary and exhilarating. Whether you are a recreational
or competitive open-water swimmer, or a triathlete, the ability to navigate
and swim effectively in lakes and oceans poses different challenges than
swimming in a pool.
The best open-water swimmers
• breathe effectively and maintain a consistent rhythm,
• modify their stroke to deal with currents and waves,
• move around buoys efficiently,
• navigate effectively and stay on course,
• prepare for competition,
• deal with challenges well, and
• adapt to rough water with ease.
The drills and tips presented in this chapter are intended to help you adapt
to swimming in the open-water environment. With preparation, open-water
swimming can be lots of fun and quite exciting!

94 KICKING IN BREATHING POSITION
Purpose
Getting enough air while swimming in open water is critically important. This
drill and the next two drills are designed to help you improve your head and
body position so that you can breathe effectively in open water.
Procedure
1. Begin by kicking in a streamlined position with your head down in the
water and exhaling (a).
2. Pull with your right arm so that you finishwith your right hand at your
side. Your left arm stays extended out in front.
3. As you are pulling with the right arm, roll your body and head to the
right so that you can breathe.
4. Continue kicking while keeping your left arm extended forward and
your right arm at your side (b).
5. Take at least three full breaths while on your right side.
6. Recover the right arm forward into a streamline position with your head
down.
7. Pull with the left arm and repeat steps 3 through 6 on the left side.
Focus Points
• Keep your kicking rhythm steady at all times.
• Keep your front arm extended while breathing to keep your body position
higher in the water and to make it easier to get air while you roll to breathe.
• Roll your body as much as you need to so that you can breathe easily.
• Keep your head in alignment. Swivel your head to breathe, don’t lift it.
Tips
• Be sure to practice this drill on both sides so that you can be more comfort-
able with alternate breathing, which can come in handy in rough waters.
• If you are practicing in a pool, use the freestyler hand paddles to help you
get the feel of keeping your body on keel with the extended arm while
you breathe.

95 SWIM THREE, BREATHE THREE
Purpose
To help you improve your head and body position so that you can breathe
effectively in open water.
Procedure
1. Swim three relaxed strokes with your head down in the water, exhaling
on the first two st okes (a).
2. On the third stroke, roll your body to the side so that the pulling arm
ends at your side.
3. As you pull your third stroke, rotate your head to breathe.
4. Hold this position for three breaths (inhales) while kicking (b).
5. Roll your head back into the water and then swim three relaxed strokes.
6. Repeat the process but breathe on the other side.
Focus Points
• Keep your kicking rhythm steady at all times.
• While swimming, keep your head down in the water in a comfortable
position. The head is heavy, and lifting it higher could become tiring over
time. Try to keep your head in alignment so that the top of your head stays
underwater and the back of your head breaks the surface.
• Keep your front arm extended while breathing to keep your body position
higher in the water and make it easier to get air while you roll to breathe.
• Roll your body as much as you need to so that you can breathe easily.
• Keep your head in alignment. Swivel your head to breathe. Don’t lift it.
• Keep your strokes nice and smooth.
Tips
• Stay relaxed and perform this drill slowly so that you get the feel of the
breathing position.
• If you are practicing in a pool, use the freestyler hand paddles to help you
get the feel of keeping your body on keel with the extended arm while
you breathe.

96 CATCH-UP AFTER BREATH
Purpose
To help you improve your arm extension during the breath so that your body
position stays high while you breathe in open water.
Procedure
1. Begin by kicking in a streamlined position with your head down in the
water and exhaling (a).
2. Pull with your right arm while keeping the left arm extended in front.
3. As you are pulling with the right arm, roll your body and head to the
right so that you can breathe. Continue to keep the left arm extended (b).
4. Return your head back into the water as you recover the right arm.
5. Bring your right hand to touch on top of your left hand (catch-up).
6. Then, pull with your left arm while keeping the right arm extended in
front.
7. As you pull with the left arm, roll your body and head to the left so that
you can breathe. Continue to keep the right arm extended.
8. Return your head back into the water as your recover the left arm (c).
9. Bring your left hand to touch on top of your right hand (catch-up).
Repeat.
Focus Points
• Keep the extended arm steady as you pull with the other arm.
• Keep your kicking rhythm steady at all times.
• While swimming, keep your head down in the water in a comfortable
position. The head is heavy, and lifting it up higher could become tiring
over time. Try to keep your head in alignment so that the top of the head
stays underwater and the back of the head breaks the surface.
• Keep your front arm extended while breathing to keep your body position
higher in the water and make it easier to get air while you roll to breathe.
• Roll your body as much as you need to so that you can breathe easily.
• Keep your head in alignment. Swivel the head, don’t lift it.
• Keep your strokes nice and smooth.
Tips
• Stay relaxed and perform this drill slowly so that you get the feel of the
breathing position.
• Be sure to practice this drill breathing on both sides so that you can be
more comfortable with alternate breathing, which can come in handy in
rough waters.
• Another way to practice this drill is to hold on to a small kickboard or
stick out in front.

97 WIDER HAND ENTRY
Purpose
To develop a more stable and balanced stroke in an unstable environment that
will allow you to swim straighter.
Procedure
1. To get the feel of where to place your hands, begin by swimming freestyle
with your head up and at least your eyes out of the water. If you have
played water polo, this position will be familiar. Your arms enter into
the water about shoulder-width apart (a). Swimming this wide with the
head up should feel fairly comfortable.
2. Start swimming freestyle with your head in the water, but keep the arms
entering the water at the same width as you did with your head up.
3. Breathe normally, but keep the arms entering the water in this wider
position (b).
Focus Points
• Keep a nice, even rhythm as you swim. Swimming this way should feel
fairly easy, even if you are not getting as much distance per stroke.
• Pay attention to how you are able to stabilize your body position with
the movement of the waves.
Tip
Vary the width of your arm entry to find the ideal placement

98 CLEARING GOGGLES
Purpose
The goggles may occasionally catch a wave and fillup with water or get foggy.
In these situations, you need to clear your goggles without losing much momen-
tum or time.
Procedure
1. When you need to clear your goggles, roll onto your back while still
kicking with an easy kick (a).
2. Relax to breathe.
3. Clear your goggles and replace.
4. Roll back over to restart swimming (b).
Focus Points
• Be sure to relax when you realize that you need to clear your goggles.
• After you roll over, keep your head back comfortably and maintain an
easy kick.
• Take the time necessary to clear the goggles well and get a good seal when
you replace them.
Tip
Practice doing this several times in the pool before you try it in open water.

99 TURNING DRILL 1: ARM-EXTENDED TECHNIQUE
Purpose
To navigate turning around a buoy quickly and efficientl .
Procedure
1. If you are turning to the left around a buoy, keep your left arm extended
in front (a).
2. Paddle with your right arm and keep kicking.
3. Your body will turn to the left (b).
4. Restart your normal stroke after you have moved around the buoy (c).
5. Reverse the procedure if turning to the right around a buoy, keeping the
right arm extended in front.
6. Paddle with your left arm and keep kicking.
7. Your body will turn to the right.
8. Restart your normal stroke after you have moved around the buoy.
Focus Points
• Be sure to keep the extended arm fully stretched out in front.
• Kick rapidly to make the turn faster.
• Use quick, short strokes with the arm that is paddling around the buoy.
• Paddle hard.
Tips
• Practice this technique in the pool to get the feel of how you can change
the direction of your body quickly just by extending one arm.
• A good way to practice this technique is to take all the lane ropes out of
the pool, set up buoys, and practice maneuvering the turns.
• This technique might be the easier way to turn when many other swim-
mers are going around the buoy at the same time.

arm as you get close to the buoy.
2. Roll your right shoulder up and back as you begin to corkscrew
counterclockwise in toward the buoy (a).
3. Turn your body as you recover the right arm into the water (while on
your back) (b).
4. Continue to corkscrew and turn your body as you pull with your right
arm and recover with your left arm (returning to your front) (c).
5. Reverse the procedure to turn to the right around a buoy.
Focus Points
• Keep your stroke long and fluid as your oll and turn past the buoy.
• Keep a strong, steady kick.
Tips
• This technique can be a fast and fluidway to get around the buoy quickly
when no other swimmers are near you.
• A good way to practice this technique is to take all the lane ropes out of
the pool, set up buoys, and practice maneuvering the turns.

101 PEER FORWARD AND THEN BREATHE
Purpose
To help you sight and navigate so that you can stay on course with the least
amount of disruption to the stroke. The idea with this drill is to peer forward
just before you would normally turn your head to the side to breathe.
Procedure
1. If you will be breathing to the right, begin to lift your head forward as
your right arm enters the water.
2. Lift your head just enough to see forward while your mouth is still in
the water (a).
3. Lift your head quickly, and then, bring your eyes back down in the water.
4. Then, roll your head and body to the right as you pull with your right
arm and breathe (b).
Focus Points
• Keep your stroke smooth and steady.
• Think of sneaking a peek forward.
• Lifting your head forward should not disrupt your stroke.
• Look for objects in the background that can help you sight and stay on
course.
Tips
• Keep your line of sight from the buoy to an object in the background. The
sighting object should be higher than the buoy.
• If nobody is around you and you can’t see the buoy, stop. Use one of the
next techniques to regain your line of sight.

102 SCULL AND KICK
Purpose
To help you regain your line of sight if you are not able to do so by just peering
forward. This technique will give you a slightly higher line of sight.
Procedure
1. Extend both arms out in front while continuing your kick (a).
2. Begin to scull with your hands out in front just beneath the surface,
pressing the water down and raising up your head (b).
3. Look for your markers or buoy.
4. Readjust your direction as necessary.
5. Put your head back down in the water and resume swimming freestyle.
Focus Points
• Keep your kicking constant to help keep your body position high.
• Scull with your hands back and forth quickly to help you raise your head
high enough to regain your line of sight.
• Scull only long enough to help you regain your direction.
Tips
• Practice this drill in the pool frequently.
• If you’re out in choppy water, try to do this along the axis of the waves
or with the waves behind you. Try to avoid sculling directly into the face
of the waves; otherwise, you may get a mouthful of water!

103 BREASTSTROKE WITH HEAD UP
Purpose
To help you regain your line of sight if you are not able to do so by just peer-
ing forward. This method usually allows you to get your head higher than the
scull and kick does.
Procedure
1. Extend both arms out in front.
2. Begin to swim breaststroke, but allow the hips to sink a little so that you
can lift your head high as you sweep the hands in (a).
3. Look for your markers or buoy (b).
4. Readjust your direction as necessary.
5. Put your head back down in the water and resume swimming freestyle.
Focus Points
• Use a strong breaststroke kick but keep the hips low to help you get your
head up high.
• Sweep with your arms to help you raise your head high enough to regain
your line of sight.
• Swim head-up breaststroke only long enough to help you regain your
direction.
Tips
• Practice this drill in the pool frequently.
• If you’re out in choppy water, try to do this along the axis of the waves or
with the waves behind you. Try to avoid swimming breaststroke directly
into the face of the waves; otherwise, you may get a mouthful of water!

104 EGGBEATER TO TREAD WATER
Purpose
To help you regain your line of sight if you are not able to do so by the three
previous methods. This method can usually get your head even higher than
using breaststroke with the head up.
Procedure
1. Stop swimming and move to a sitting position with your head up above
the water and your shoulders at or slightly below the surface.
2. With your knees wide and your knees bent, rotate your feet in a circular
kick. The right foot moves counterclockwise, and the left foot moves
clockwise. Time the kick so that the left foot is out when the right foot is
in and the left foot is in when the right foot is out (a).
3. Use your hands to scull underneath the surface to stabilize your upper
body and to help in gaining lift (b).
4. Look for your markers or buoy.
5. Readjust your direction as necessary.
6. Put you head back down in the water and resume swimming freestyle.
Focus Points
• Make sure that the kicks are alternating and not simultaneous like in the
breaststroke.
• Use a strong kick along with sculling to help you get your head high
enough to regain your line of sight.
• Tread water only long enough to help you regain your direction.
Tips
• Practice this drill in the pool frequently.
• Treading water can be a lifesaving tool.
• If you’re out in choppy water, try to do this along the axis of the waves or
with the waves behind you. Try to avoid treading water directly into the
face of the waves; otherwise, you may get a mouthful of water!

Chapter 9
Starts
“Swimmers, take your mark. . . .” Then the gun or horn sounds! Watching a
swimmer perform a great start is like watching an act of true beauty: quick
release, tremendous launch through the air, smooth entry, tight streamline,
rapid travel through a great distance underwater, and then coming up well
ahead of the pack. For competitive swimmers, the start is by far the fast-
est part of the race. If it is performed well, the start can make a significant
difference in the outcome, especially in the sprint races. Conversely, a poor
start can leave a swimmer well behind.
These drills concentrate on
• teaching you how to dive,
• teaching different kinds of dives,
• developing leg strength and power,
• discovering your balance point when starting from the blocks, and
• attaining a tight streamline position and controlling the depth of your
dive.
The drills in this chapter help you make stronger and faster starts. All
these drills are fun as well. Swimmers always seem to like practicing starts!
225

105 JUMPING FROM THE BLOCKS
Purpose
To develop explosive leg power for the starts from the blocks.
Procedure
The two main positions for setting up on the blocks are the traditional start with
both feet forward and the track start with one foot forward and the other foot
back a little. Either setup can be effective, depending on the swimmer.
1. Place your feet at the edge of the block. For this drill, the traditional start
with both feet forward is usually better than the track start.
2. Bending your knees and using your arms to swing forward, jump from
the block into the pool and land feetfirst as far into the pool as you can
(a, b).
3. Extend your feet as you leave the block so that you spring off your toes.
Focus Points
• Keep your head forward.
• Get as much distance as possible. Use those legs.
Tips
• Practice jumping rope and performing standing broad jumps to increase
your leg strength and jumping ability.
• Have someone measure your distance.
• Give yourself a target to jump to.
• Variation: Try jumping over a noodle.

106 STANDING STREAMLINE JUMP
Purpose
To develop the mechanics of quickly extending the body into the streamline
position. This drill prepares you to make a clean entry into the water from the
blocks.
Procedure
1. Stand on the deck or in the water. Position your feet 2 to 4 inches (5 or
10 cm) apart.
2. Bend your knees and bring your hands down your legs below your
knees. Keep the arms straight (a).
3. Begin the movement of the jump by bringing the arms together in front
of you and swinging them upward as you jump up into a streamline
position (b). Jump as high as you can.
4. When you jump, push and point your toes. A cue we use with little kids
is ballerina toes.
5. Hold the streamline position as you land safely (c).
6. Repeat at least 10 times.
Focus Points
• Swing your arms forward and upward while keeping them straight. The
bigger the arm swing is, the more momentum you build for the jump.
• Stay balanced and return to the same spot that you left.
Tip
Stand in shallow water underneath the flagsso that you can jump up and touch
them. But, don’t look for the flagswhen you jump; make sure that your head
stays in the streamline position—arms tight behind the ears with streamline
locked in.

107 STREAMLINE JUMP FROM THE BLOCKS
Purpose
To take the next step in developing the start and practice getting into a streamline
position quickly off the blocks.
Procedure
This drill uses the same action as the standing streamline jumps, except that you
are on the blocks and jump up and out so that you land in the water.
1. Stand on the blocks. Position your feet 2 to 4 inches (5 or 10 cm) apart
with the toes over the edge.
2. Bend your knees and bring your hands down your legs below your
knees. Keep the arms straight.
3. Begin the movement of the jump by bringing the arms together in front
of you and swinging them upward as you jump up into a streamline
position (a). Jump forward and as high as you can.
4. Hold the streamline position as you land safely. Try to have a clean entry
so that your body is completely straight (b, c).
5. As you enter the water, keep your toes pointed down toward the water
to make a cleaner entry and get you used to pointing your toes during
a dive.
6. Repeat at least 10 times.
Focus Points
• Swing your arms forward and upward while keeping them straight. The
bigger the arm swing is, the more momentum you build for the jump.
• Get completely stretched out into a streamline and land feetfirst. Keep
the toes pointed.
• Keep your head looking forward only.
Tip
Have a coach use a shepherd’s crook or pole to attach a target of some sort that
you can jump up to and touch safely. But don’t look for the target when you
jump; make sure that your head stays in the streamline position.

108 STREAMLINE JUMP PLUS NOODLE
Purpose
To provide a sensory target to aid in the movement of quickly setting up the
streamline off the blocks.
Procedure
This advanced drill requires the assistance of a coach. You perform the same
action you did in the previous drill, but you knock away the noodle with your
arms as you jump.
1. Stand on the blocks. Position your feet 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) apart
with the toes over the edge.
2. Bend your knees and bring your hands down your legs below your
knees. Keep the arms straight (a).
3. Your coach will hold a noodle about waist height and about 2 feet (60
cm) in front of you.
4. Begin the movement of the jump by bringing the arms together in front
of you and swinging them upward as you jump up into a streamline
position (b, c). Knock away the noodle as you jump. Jump forward and
as high as you can.
5. Hold the streamline position as you land safely. Try to have a clean entry
so that your body is completely straight.
6. Repeat at least 10 times.
Focus Points
• Swing the arms forward and upward while keeping them straight. The
bigger and faster the arm swing is, the more momentum you build for
the jump. Knock away the noodle with a hard swing.
• Get completely stretched out into a streamline and land feetfirst
• Keep the head looking forward only.
Tip
For the coach: Stand on the side of the deck and attach the noodle to a pole so
that you can position it properly, and be prepared to get wet!

109 PUSH-OFF START FROM THE WALL
Purpose
To teach the mechanics of the release and body entry. If done properly, this start
is just like a butterfly entr .
Procedure
1. Position yourself in the water facing away from the wall. Your hands
are behind you holding the gutter wall, and your feet are up high on the
wall (a).
2. Lunge forward and slightly above the surface as you release from the wall.
Your arms will travel forward just as they do in a butterfly recovery (b).
3. As your hands come forward and together, get your forehead down and
dive into the water, just as you would for the butterfly (c).
4. Immediately reach a tight streamline position. You should have a clean
entry.
5. If you time it properly, you can perform a small dolphin kick as your feet
enter the water.
Focus Points
• Get your head down quickly as you enter the water.
• Punch a clean hole into the water as you enter.
• Get into a tight streamline right away.
Tip
Try diving over a noodle or some other soft obstacle.

112 SETUP ON THE BLOCKS
Purpose
To establish getting into good body position on the blocks in preparation for
the dive.
Procedure
You can do this drill with either the traditional setup or the track start setup,
depending on your preference. (Most swimmers and coaches prefer a track start
because it tends to produce a faster reaction time off the blocks.)
Traditional start setup (a):
1. Step forward to the front of the block and place your feet wide with your
big toes curled over the edge.
2. With your knees slightly bent, reach down with your hands until your
fingertips are just under the front bottom edge of the block. Barely
grab the edge of the block so that your grip is like a finger hold in rock
climbing. Make sure that your hands grab the block outside your feet.
3. Be sure to balance your body so that you are leaning forward without
falling in. Your hips should be up and forward.
Track start setup (b):
1. Stand with your heels at the back edge of the block.
2. Step forward with one foot only and place that foot with your big toe
curled over the edge.
3. With the forward knee slightly bent, reach down with your hands until
your fingertips are just under the front bottom edge of the block. Barely
grab the edge of the block so that your grip is like a finger hold in rock
climbing.
4. Push the heel of the back leg up and keep the knee of the back leg only
slightly bent.
5. Be sure to balance your body so that you are leaning forward without
falling in. Your hips should be up and forward. Your weight should be
evenly distributed between both legs.
Focus Points
• Barely grab the block outside the feet to allow you to release quickly.
• Balance forward to set up the quickest release and launch from the block.
Tip
Practice getting into position smoothly and consistently. Have a coach give the
command, “Take your mark,” and get your body into a stable position right
away. Be steady and ready!

115 STREAMLINE DIVING
Purpose
To develop the proper path in the air and in the water to gain the greatest speed
for racing starts.
Procedure
The start is the fastest part of the race, and the fastest part of the start occurs when
you travel through the air. The second fastest part of the start is the streamline
on entry into the water.
1. Set up on the blocks (a).
2. Take your mark (b).
3. Launch on command.
4. Enter the water in a streamline and hold the streamline position without
kicking or pulling (c). If you time it properly, however, you can have
one dolphin kick as you enter the water. Continue traveling through the
water as far as you can go until you break the surface. Then stop (d).
5. Measure how many sections of the lane rope past the flags you were able
to travel. The greater the number is, the better your streamline entry is.
Focus Points
• Get a great launch.
• Be in a streamline by the time you enter the water.
• Hold the streamline and slice through the water.
• Try to dive in with no splash.
Tips
• Have a contest to see who can travel the farthest in a streamline off the start.
• For the coach: Stand on the side of the pool and send off your swimmers.
Time them for 7 (younger) to 10 (older) yards (meters). Every 1/10 of a
second matters!

116 BUTTERFLY START
Purpose
To add the butterfly b eakout to the dive and entry.
Procedure
This start is a medium-depth entry.
1. Come down and take your mark. This time, hold steady at the balance
point.
2. On the command “Go,” release and enter the water (a).
3. After you enter the water, begin your butterfly breakout with a few (five
to eight) dolphin kicks to the surface (b).
4. Come to the surface and break out from under the water. Do not take a
breath on the breakout (c).
Focus Points
• Aim for a tight streamline on entry.
• Control your breathing for the first two or th ee strokes.
Tip
Do a dolphin kick as you enter the water.

117 BREASTSTROKE START
Purpose
To add the breaststroke pullout to the dive and entry. Many changes have
occurred in the rules of the pulldown. The current interpretation allows a dol-
phin kick while still in streamline.
Procedure
This start is the deepest of the dives. Generally, swimmers should reach a depth
of about 3 feet (90 cm).
1. Come down and take your mark. Hold steady at the balance point.
2. On the command “Go,” release and enter the water (a).
3. After you enter the water, begin your breaststroke pullout by holding
the streamline for a count of three.
4. Dolphin kick while still in streamline. Hold for a count of two.
5. Pull down and then hold for another count of two (b).
6. Bring your hands up along your body until they are in front of your eyes.
Then breaststroke kick up and stretch for a count of one before starting
the breaststroke (c).
Focus Points
• Aim for a tight streamline on entry.
• Control the gliding for the pullout. Be patient.
• The longer the initial glide is, the farther your pulldown will be.
Tip
See how far you can go underwater until you break the surface. Then, have
someone time how fast you can get to the same point on repeated efforts.

118 FREESTYLE START
Purpose
To add the freestyle breakout to the dive and entry.
Procedure
This start is the shallowest of the dives. You should reach the surface fairly
quickly after you are in the water, especially on the shorter sprint races.
1. Come down and take your mark. Hold steady at the balance point.
2. On the command “Go,” release and enter the water.
3. After you enter the water, dolphin kick to the surface and then switch to
flutter kick in a tight streamline position (a). Bring your head up fairly
quickly.
4. Begin the freestyle by pulling down with the arm that is on the bottom of
the streamline and breaking the surface (b).
5. Control your breathing for at least the first four strokes (c).
Focus Points
• Aim for a tight streamline entry.
• Kick hard and quickly.
• Come up to the surface quickly.
• Control your breathing.
Tip
Many swimmers now add several quick dolphin kicks during the underwater
streamline. Many coaches ask swimmers to perform fiveto eight dolphin kicks
in practice to build the skill into their strokes. Learning this skill early is vital
to developing the underwater dolphin kick. Having a strong dolphin kick can
be a distinct advantage. Test to see how many dolphin kicks help with your
underwater speed.

119 SIMPLE RELAY START
Purpose
To develop the mechanics and timing for a well-executed relay exchange.
Procedure
This process is for the start of the second, third, and fourth legs of the medley
relay or freestyle relay.
1. Set up on the blocks in either the traditional or track start foot placement.
2. Practice with your teammate sprinting in from about 12 yards (meters)
out.
3. As your teammate gets to about 10 yards (meters) away, extend your
arms forward so that they are directed at your teammate’s head (a).
4. Continue to follow your teammate with your eyes and your arms. Bend
over as your teammate approaches (b).
5. When your teammate is one stroke away from touching the wall, quickly
swing your arms all the way back.
6. Then quickly swing your arms forward as you launch off the blocks and
into your dive (c).
Focus Points
• For the relay exchange to be legal, your toes must still be touching the
blocks when your teammate touches the wall. If your feet have left the
block when your teammate touches, your relay will be disqualified
• Practice the timing with your teammates in the order that you will be
swimming in the race.
Tip
Practice this drill with a coach on the side who can tell you whether your
exchanges are legal or not. The coach can also let you know whether you need
to make your exchange sooner.

120 ADVANCED RELAY START
Purpose
To develop the mechanics and timing for a well-executed relay exchange for
more advanced swimmers.
Procedure
This process is for the start of the second, third, and fourth legs of the medley
relay or freestyle relay.
1. Set up on the blocks by standing at the back of the block.
2. Practice with your teammate sprinting in from about 12 yards (meters)
out.
3. As your teammate gets to about 10 yards (meters) away, extend your
arms forward so that your arms are directed at your teammate’s head (a).
4. Continue to follow your teammate with your eyes and your arms. Bend
over as your teammate approaches.
5. When your teammate is one stroke away from touching the wall, start to
take a double-arm backstroke.
6. As your arms rise at the start of the stroke step forward with the first
foot, and as the arms complete the double-arm backstroke step forward
with the second foot so that both feet are at the front of the block as you
dive in (b).
7. Then quickly throw your arms into streamline as you launch off the
blocks and into your dive (c).
Focus Points
• For the relay exchange to be legal, your toes must still be touching the
blocks when your teammate touches the wall. If your feet have left the
block when your teammate touches, your relay will be disqualified
• Practice the timing with your teammates in the order that you will be

121 BACKSTROKE START, SETUP,
LAUNCH, AND ENTRY
Purpose
To develop the mechanics for an effective backstroke start.
Procedure
Focus on getting your hips up high above the water as you leave the wall.
1. To learn to arch your back properly, practice in shallow water (4 to 5 feet
[120 to 150 cm] deep). From the wall, push off and immediately perform
a back dive into a handstand position. Try to hit the handstand just a few
feet (a meter) away from the wall.
2. Next, have someone hold a noodle at the surface about 3 to 5 feet (90 to
150 cm) from the wall (depending on your size). Try to dive backward
over the noodle without letting your hips touch it. Immediately reach a
streamline position and kick.
3. To set up for the backstroke start, hold on to the gutter. Place your feet
on the wall about shoulder-width apart, approximately 2 feet (60 cm)
deep (a).
4. Keep your hips out, away from the wall; do not tuck them in toward the
wall.
5. On the command “Take your mark,” bend your elbows and bring your
head in toward your hands but keep your hips out and keep your back
as straight as you can (b).
6. On “Go,” push with your hands, throw your hands and head back into
streamline, and spring off the wall. Push your hips up above the surface
and punch a clean streamline on the entry.
Focus Points
• Set up properly. Keep your hips out, away from the wall.
• Arch your back so that your hips clear the surface.
• Get into a tight streamline right away.
Tip
Practice taking off from the wall with your hands holding the gutter handles
before moving up to the handles on the blocks.

122 BACKSTROKE START
Purpose
To add the backstroke breakout to the launch and entry.
Procedure
Having a strong dolphin kick for the underwater work in this start is an advan-
tage. The rules prohibit traveling more than 15 meters underwater, so you’ll
need to come up sooner than that distance.
1. Set up on the wall with your hands holding the gutter or the handles of
the blocks.
2. On the command “Take your mark,” bend your elbows and bring your
head in toward your hands but keep your hips out.
3. On “Go,” release your hands, throw your head back, and spring off the
wall. Push your hips up above the surface and punch a clean streamline
on the entry (a).
4. Kick for a count of at least eight (b) and then pull one arm down to your
side to begin the backstroke arm action (c).
5. Control your depth so that you break the surface just as you finish your
first arm pull.
6. Complete about three strokes.
Focus Points
• Perform a clean entry.
• Control your depth.
• Hold a tight streamline for a count of eight or more while kicking.
• Pull only one arm down first befo e starting your backstroke.
Tip
After you master this drill with the flutter kick, you should add dolphin kicking
in the streamline position and try to get a lot more distance and speed. Gener-
ally, five to eight dolphin kicks are ideal, but be sure to control your depth.
Remember, you cannot travel more than 15 meters underwater.

Chapter 10
Freestyle and
Backstroke Turns
Approximately one-quarter of a race involves starts, turns, and finishes.
These maneuvers require skill, precision, and speed. Even small errors in
execution can separate the champion from the average swimmer. Swimmers
must consistently practice good starts, turns, and finishes.
These drills teach you how to
• perform a proper flip (somersault) for both the freestyle and backstroke
turns,
• control your breathing while approaching the wall on the freestyle turn,
• approach the wall smoothly and accurately for the backstroke turn, and
• land your feet properly at the wall and push off to a streamline position.
This chapter addresses the most frequently performed turn, the freestyle
turn, as well as the most troublesome turn, the backstroke turn. The following
drills provide a systematic approach to mastering the fundamentals of these
turns. Spending a fair amount of time to improve and practice these turns
is a worthwhile investment. Whether you are an age-group competitor, a
national-level competitor, a masters swimmer, or even an open-water swim-
mer, these turns require a consistent amount of dedicated time in practice.

123 STREAMLINE JUMPS
Purpose
To develop the quickness needed to get into a proper streamline position in
preparation for the streamline push-offs from the wall.
Procedure
1. Stand in shallow water at least waist deep, but not more than shoulder
deep.
2. Lift your arms so that your hands are at your sides near your shoulders
and bend your knees in preparation for a jump (a).
3. Jump straight up. As you jump, extend your arms upward into a
streamline position (b). You should reach the streamline by the time you
reach the peak of your jump. Hold the streamline as you land (c) and
then release.
4. Repeat at least 10 times.
Focus Points
• Jump straight up and as high as you can.
• Work on getting into a perfect streamline quickly.
Tips
• Do this drill facing a partner and have a third person or coach tell you
when to jump. Challenge each other to get into the streamline more quickly.
• Stand underneath the backstroke flagsif the depth works for you. When
you jump, see whether you are going straight up and touching the flags
each time.

124 JUMP AND SOMERSAULT
Purpose
To develop speed in performing the somersault and to get a sense of how to
somersault more quickly through the air.
Procedure
You should be able to do a basic somersault before attempting this advanced
drill. But, it’s lots of fun!
1. Stand in shallow water so that you are at least waist deep, but not more
than shoulder deep.
2. Bend your knees in preparation for a jump (a).
3. Jump straight up. As you jump, drive your head down between
your knees as you perform a complete somersault (b–e). Try to do the
somersault as high out of the water as possible. Land on your feet.
4. Repeat at least 10 times. Be sure to pause between jumps so that you
don’t get too dizzy!
Focus Points
• Your body will travel faster through the air than it will through the water.
Work on having your body somersault through the air as much as possible.
• The faster your body flips ove , the better.
Tip
Do this drill while facing a partner and have a third person or coach tell you
when to jump. Have plenty of space between you and your partner. Challenge
each other to go faster.

125 PUSH-OFF AND SOMERSAULT
Purpose
To develop control of the body position going into the turn and to use the head
and abdominals in performing the flip
Procedure
Before beginning this drill, you may want to review the Gliding in Streamline
drill in chapter 1.
1. Start at the wall with one hand on the wall, ready to push off.
2. Push off the wall at the surface on your front. Your nose should be down
and your arms should be down at your sides (a). Travel along the surface
for 4 to 5 yards (meters).
3. Using your head to start the action, drive the head down and under you
to perform a complete somersault (b–e).
4. Come to a stop and breathe.
5. Return to the wall and repeat as necessary.
Focus Points
• Absolutely do not lift your head to breathe until after you complete the
somersault.
• Drive your head down quickly to start the somersault. Your somersault
should be in a fairly tight tuck position. Do the somersault as high as
possible so that your body travels mostly through the air rather than
through the water.
Tip
As you perform the somersault, exhale and squeeze the abdominals.

126 ONE-ARM EXTENSION AND FLIP
Purpose
To develop the next step in the sequence—performing the flipstarting from an
extended position.
Procedure
This drill is the same as the previous one except that you extend one arm.
1. Start at the wall with one hand on the wall, ready to push off.
2. Push off the wall at the surface on your front. You nose should be down,
one arm should be extended forward, and the other arm should be down
at your side (a). Travel along the surface for 4 to 5 yards (meters).
3. Using your arm to start the action, pull the arm and head down and
under you to perform a complete somersault (b–e).
4. Come to a stop and breathe.
5. Return to the wall and repeat as necessary. Switch arms.
Focus Points
• Absolutely do not lift your head to breathe until after you complete the
somersault.
• Drive your arm and head down quickly to start the somersault.
• Drive the arm and head at the same time. Avoid the common pitfall of
pulling the arm first and then driving the head
• Keep plenty of lift and speed!
Tip
As you perform the somersault, exhale and squeeze the abdominals.

128 PLUS THREE STROKES,
PLUS THREE-COUNT STRETCH
Purpose
To develop the next step in the sequence—adding freestyle swimming before
the flip
Procedure
This drill is the same as the previous one, except that you add three freestyle
strokes and a three-count hold. The three-count hold, with kicking, is important
to setting up a stretched position before the turn. When the body is stretched,
it is higher and therefore able to flipmore through the air, which translates to
more speed.
1. Start at the wall with one hand on the wall, ready to push off.
2. Push off the wall at the surface on your front. Your nose should be down.
Swim three strokes of freestyle, counting each time your hand enters the
water as one (a). Then, hold the extended position and kick along the
surface for a count of three (b).
3. Using your arm to start the action, drive the arm and head down and
under you to perform a complete somersault (c–f).
4. Come to a stop and breathe.
5. Repeat, going back toward the wall. Switch arms.
Focus Points
• Absolutely do not lift your head to breathe until after you complete the
somersault.
• Be completely stretched out on the surface after your three strokes.
• Drive your arm and head down quickly to start the somersault.
• Drive the arm and head at the same time. Avoid the common pitfall of
pulling the arm firstand then driving the head. Keep kicking all the way
into the somersault.
• Keep plenty of lift and speed!
Tip
As you perform the somersault, exhale and squeeze the abdominals.

129 BACKSTROKE BREAKOUT
Purpose
To develop the next step for flipturns and to teach the proper method of begin-
ning the backstroke after a start or turn.
Procedure
1. Start by pushing off the wall underwater in a streamline position on
your back, about 2 feet (60 cm) deep (a–c). As you clear the wall, begin a
flutter kick(d).
2. Kick for a count of at least eight and then pull one arm down to your side
to begin the backstroke arm action (e).
3. Control your depth so that you break the surface just as you finish your
first arm pull (f).
4. Complete about three strokes.
5. Repeat.
Focus Points
• Control your depth.
• Hold a tight streamline for a count of eight or more while kicking.
• Pull only one arm down first befo e starting your backstroke.
Tip
After you master this drill with the flutterkick, you can add dolphin kicking
in the streamline position and try to get a lot more distance and speed. But, be
sure to control your depth. The dolphin kick is used mostly with the butterfly
and the backstroke start, but it is also effective for some swimmers in the free-
style push-off.

130 FOOT TOUCH
Purpose
To develop the next step for the flipturn. This drill reinforces breathing control
on the approach and teaches accurate landing of the feet at the wall.
Procedure
1. Begin about 10 to 12 yards (meters) from the wall. Swim freestyle toward
the wall (a). Control your breathing from the flags (5 yards [meters]) on in.
2. When you are at least two strokes from the wall, perform your somersault
and land your feet on the wall about 1 foot (30 cm) below the surface (b).
If you are too far away, continue to repeat the approach and gradually
turn closer to the wall until you find the right distance for your turn.
3. Do not push off; just land your feet. You should be able to look at your
feet while underwater to see where they land on the wall.
4. When your feet land properly on the wall, your body will be in a lounge
chair position underwater (on your back with the hips and knees slightly
bent) and your hands will be just above your head. Your feet will land
about 1 to 2 feet (30 to 60 cm) deep, depending on your size (c). (If you are
smaller, your feet will be higher; if you are larger, your feet will be lower.)
Focus Points
• Control your breathing so that you can focus on the wall.
• Perform a quick, high flip
• Look to see where your feet land.
Tip
Master the ability to pull through the turn with either arm.

131 FREESTYLE TO BACKSTROKE TURN
Purpose
To practice the proper mechanics of the turn and work on achieving the greatest
speed possible. This important drill should be practiced frequently.
Procedure
Now you combine the approach, the foot touch, and the backstroke breakout to
perform a freestyle to backstroke turn. This important drill will help you learn
to control your approach, push-off, and, eventually, speed. Practice doing it
correctly several times before you try to increase your speed.
1. Swim freestyle to the wall with proper breath control (a).
2. Perform your flip and land your feet on the wall, just as you did in the
Foot Touch drill (b).
3. Push off underwater into the streamline position (c) and start your
backstroke breakout (d).
Focus Points
• Be in control.
• Look to see where you land before you push off.
• Don’t rush it. Practice being accurate first
Tip
After you master the mechanics of this drill and consistently place your land-
ing correctly, try to anticipate the wall and begin to push off just before your
feet land. This way you will punch off the wall quickly, which will help you
develop the fastest turn possible.

132 CORKSCREW FREESTYLE BREAKOUT
Purpose
To develop the next step for the freestyle flipturn by teaching an effective method
for getting off the wall with the fastest mechanics possible.
Procedure
1. Start by pushing off the wall underwater in a streamline position on
your back, about 2 feet (60 cm) deep. As you clear the wall, begin a flutter
kick (a–c).
2. Kick for a count of four while holding the streamline position on your
back. Then, still holding the streamline, begin to corkscrew (a one-quarter
twist) slowly to your side while counting another four (d–f). Then, start
to come to the surface and pull the lower arm down in a freestyle stroke
as your body rotates to your front.
3. Control your depth so that you break the surface just as you finishyour
first arm pull.
4. Complete about three strokes of freestyle.
5. Repeat.
Focus Points
• Control your depth.
• Hold a tight streamline for a count of four on your back and for another
count of four as you corkscrew while kicking.
Tip
After you master this drill with the flutterkick, you can add dolphin kicking
in the streamline position and try to get a lot more distance and speed, but be
sure to control your depth. The dolphin kick is used mostly with the butterfly
and the backstroke start, but is also effective for some swimmers in the freestyle
push-off. You may want to use a combination of a few dolphin kicks followed
by flutter kicking

133 FREESTYLE TURN WITH KICKBOARD
Purpose
To learn how to finish the turn in streamline for the freestyle and backstroke
turns.
Procedure
The rules do not require you to be on your front when you leave the wall.
Because twisting on the wall slows the turn, this drill focuses on finishingin
the streamline body position before you push off the wall. Review the Freestyle
to Backstroke Turn drill.
1. Start out about 10 to 12 yards (meters) from the wall.
2. Hold two kickboards at the sides of your hips, one in each hand, with the
palms facing down (a).
3. Perform your flip and land your feet on the wall (b, c). Do not push off.
4. As you flip, do not move the boards. They will start at the hip at the
beginning of the flip.By not moving them at the end of the flip,they will
end up above your head.
5. This drill is only for practicing the setup of the streamline when finishing
the flip.You do not need to push off to do this drill correctly.
Focus Points
• Keep the boards still and in position as you perform the flip
• Finish the flipwith the arms extended above your head to simulate the
streamline.
• Be sure to finishthe flipon the back. This drill can be used for both free-
style and backstroke.
Tip
Focus on the mechanics first.You do not need to perform this drill quickly.

134 FREESTYLE TURN
Purpose
To complete the process for the freestyle turn.
Procedure
The rules do not require you to be on your front when you leave the wall.
Because twisting on the wall slows the turn, this drill focuses on rotating the
body after the push-off from the wall during the streamline portion of the turn.
Review the Freestyle to Backstroke Turn drill.
1. Start out about 10 to 12 yards (meters) from the wall.
2. Swim freestyle to the wall with proper breath control (a).
3. Perform your flip and land your feet on the wall (b, c).
4. Push off underwater into a streamline position on your back (d, e).
5. Kick for a count of four while holding the streamline position on your
back. Then, still holding the streamline, begin to corkscrew (a one-
quarter twist) slowly to your side while counting another four (f). Then
start to come to the surface and pull the lower arm down in a freestyle
stroke as your body rotates to your front (g).
6. Control your depth so that you break the surface just as you finish your
first arm pull.
7. Complete about three strokes of freestyle.
Focus Points
• Push off while still on your back.
• Rotate your body after you clear the wall, not while on the wall.
Tips
• Focus on the mechanics first befo e trying to increase your speed.
• Try to control your breathing for the firsttwo or three strokes after your
turn as well.
• Advanced: Add a few quick dolphin kicks as you come off the wall in
your streamline. The best swimmers are able to get several kicks in this
position to add speed before they start their stroke.

135 BACKSTROKE FINISH
Purpose
To teach you a safe method to determine the stroke count from the flagsto the
wall for the backstroke finish.This stroke count is important for both the finish
and the turn.
Procedure
1. Start at the middle of the pool. Swim backstroke at full speed toward the
wall.
2. Just as you pass directly underneath the backstroke flags, begin to count
your strokes. At first, take just two strokes past the flags and then kick in
the rest of the way, with your arm extended (a).
3. Finish by letting your hand touch the wall with your fingers pointing
down. Bend the elbow of the up arm just a little as you kick in on your
last stroke (b). You should not have to look back for the wall at all. Just
focus on the flags and your stroke count.
4. If you have plenty of room, add one more stroke the next time. As long as
you have a safe amount of room remaining, continue to add one stroke
at a time until you reach a safe number of strokes.
5. Be consistent in how you count the number of strokes you take from the
flags. Ideally, on your last stroke, your hand will enter the water between
1 and 3 feet (between 30 and 90 cm) from the wall. This finish will be safe.
Focus Points
• Practice this drill at full speed.
• Kick in hard.
• Focus on the flags, not the wall
• Be consistent in how you count your strokes.
• Know your stroke count!
Tips
• Taking fewer, more powerful strokes with lots of strong kicking is better
than taking than a greater number of choppy, short strokes. Try to estab-
lish the lowest number of strokes with great speed and complete safety.
• Advanced: Try adding a dolphin kick to the last stroke into the wall, but be
sure not dive underwater because doing so would result in disqualification

136 CORKSCREW SWIMMING
Purpose
To practice rolling properly onto the abdomen before performing the backstroke
flipturn. This action is called corkscrew swimming because you twist and spiral
through the water just as a corkscrew twists through a cork.
Procedure
1. Start by swimming one arm stroke of freestyle on your front (a).
2. While flutter kicking, turn your head to breathe and keep turning your
head and body so that you are on your back (b, c).
3. Recover the down arm using a backstroke recovery and pull with the up
arm.
4. Continue to turn your head and body in the same direction until you
are completely on your front side. This completes one corkscrew stroke.
5. Taking smooth and controlled strokes, swim the corkscrew stroke in
one direction for four strokes and then swim the corkscrew stroke in the
other direction. Repeat this several times.
Focus Points
• Keep the stroke smooth.
• Keep a steady kick.
Tips
• See how few corkscrew strokes you can take per lap. The fewer you need
to do, the better.
• This drill can be used as a game in which swimmers swim an entire lap.
They end up pretty dizzy, so it can be fun.

137 BACKSTROKE TURN
Purpose
To complete the process for the backstroke turn.
Procedure
Now you will be able to complete the backstroke turn. Remember what your
stroke count is for the backstroke finish. It should be the same total number
of strokes that you will take for the turn, but you might need to make a minor
adjustment to the number of strokes you take for the turn.
1. Subtract one from your stroke count for the backstroke finish. This
number will be the number of backstroke arm strokes you will take from
the flags while still on your back
2. After your arm enters the water for the last arm stroke, you roll to that
same side. Then, with the other arm, take one corkscrew stroke (freestyle
recovery) to get to your abdomen (a, b).
3. Now you are in position to do your flip, just as in the Freestyle to
Backstroke Turn drill (c–e). The total number of strokes for your turn
should be the same as for your finish.
4. Practice this drill first in the open water before trying it at the wall. Keep
the strokes smooth.
5. If you find that you are consistently too far from the wall, you may need
to add a stroke. If you find that you are consistently too close, you should
subtract a stroke. After you push off, complete the backstroke breakout.
Focus Points
• Keep a steady stroke rhythm.
• Keep a strong kick.
• Focus on consistency.
Tips
• Roll smoothly and gradually. Remember that the action must be continu-
ous after your shoulders are past the vertical position.
• Advanced: Add a few quick dolphin kicks as you come off the wall in
your streamline. The best swimmers are able to do fiveto eight dolphin
kicks in this position to add speed before they break out into their stroke.

Other Turns
and Finishes
Four of the seven turns in competitive swimming require a simultaneous
two-hand touch at the wall followed by the turning of the body and a push-
ing off into the next segment of the race. Many swimmers have difficulty
making these complex turns in a smooth manner. You need specific skills to
make these turns quickly and efficiently. Mastering certain details and cor-
recting faults can make a significant difference. This chapter addresses the
basic mechanics necessary to make these turns effectively and then covers
each one specifically.
These drills focus on
• touching and releasing quickly from the wall,
• developing the proper sequence of steps in making an effective turn,
• attaining a streamline position off the wall, and
• finishing into the wall or touch pad in a streamline position.
This chapter also addresses the backstroke to breaststroke turn, which
requires only a one-hand touch. Although considerable variation is possible
in the execution of this turn, the basic style, the reverse flip, and the new
crossover turn are all presented. After you master this approach, you can
then consider more advanced styles.

138 BREASTSTROKE FINISH
Purpose
To finish the b eaststroke properly.
Procedure
The most common error for this turn is taking more short strokes when approach-
ing the wall instead of taking fewer strokes and performing a strong kick and
glide into the wall.
1. Start from 10 to 12 yards (meters) from the wall. Swim breaststroke at full
speed toward the wall (a). When you reach the flags, try to take fewer
strokes to the wall.
2. On the last stroke, get your arms completely stretched out in front of you
in a streamline position as you kick and glide into the wall.
3. Drive your head down into the streamline as you finish into the wall.
Your fingertips should touch the wall underwater (b). Remember that
your hands must touch the wall at the same time. Otherwise, you could
be disqualified from a race.
Focus Points
• Finish in a streamline.
• Touch the wall underwater.
Tips
• Practice the breaststroke kick underwater while holding a streamline
position with your arms. See how far you can glide for each kick.
• Practice kicking into the wall underwater from about 5 to 10 yards (meters)
away. Get a feel for how much distance you can cover with each kick.

139 BASIC TWO-HAND OPEN TURN
Purpose
To understand the basic mechanics for the two-hand touch turn. This drill
applies to four turns: butterflyto butterfl , butterflyto backstroke, breaststroke
to breaststroke, and breaststroke to freestyle.
Procedure
All these turns require you to roll a little to the side after you have touched the
wall with both hands together. You should never release both hands from the
wall at the same time. You should use a two-step release of the hands. The first
hand to release goes underwater; the second hand to release travels over the
water. Follow these steps:
1. Touch the wall with both hands (a), bring your knees in under your chest
(b), and place your feet on the wall.
2. With one arm, pull an imaginary ripcord from the wall and turn to the
side. Roll the same shoulder back (c).
3. Push your head underwater.
4. Throw the trail arm past your head so that your hands come together (d).
5. Push off underwater and streamline.
Focus Points
• Practice the steps slowly and in order.
• On the butterflyto backstroke turn, drive the arm back directly over your
head. On the other turns, throw more to the side and in front of your face,
similar to a freestyle recovery.
• Remember the pattern: touch, turn, under, throw, push.
Tip
As you increase speed, try to release the first hand as quickly as possible

140 BASIC TWO-HAND OPEN TURN
WITH BACKSTROKE PUSH-OFF
Purpose
To develop the basic mechanics of the two-hand touch turn.
Procedure
This drill is only for practice, but it will help you develop the basic mechanics.
It is the simplest way to practice the turn mechanics.
1. Start from 10 to 12 yards (meters) from the wall. Swim breaststroke at
full speed toward the wall. When you reach the flags, try to take fewer
strokes to the wall.
2. On the last stroke, get your arms completely stretched out in front of you
in a streamline position as you kick and glide into the wall (a).
3. Drive your head down into the streamline as you finish into the wall.
Your fingertips should touch the wall underwater.
4. Touch the wall with both hands, bring your knees in under your chest,
and place your feet on the wall (b, c).
5. With one arm, pull an imaginary ripcord from the wall and turn to the
side. Roll the same shoulder back (d).
6. Push your head underwater.
7. Throw the trailing arm past your head so that your hands come together.
8. Push off underwater on your back and streamline (e).
9. Kick and do a backstroke breakout.
Focus Points
• Remember the pattern: touch, turn, under, throw, push.
• Remember, the most important part of any turn is the streamline! Make
sure you set yourself up to get an excellent streamline push-off.
Tip
As you increase speed, try to release the firsthand quickly. Then, try to pounce
off the wall into the streamline.

141 BREASTSTROKE PULLOUT
Purpose
To perform a proper breaststroke pullout for the starts and turns. This instruction
gives a general guide for good timing in the sequence. A well-executed pullout
is a distinct advantage in a race.
Procedure
1. Push off the wall on your abdomen, underwater, into a streamline
position, facing down toward the bottom (a). Hold this position for a
count of three.
2. Pull your arms down underneath you until your hands finish on your
legs just above your knees. Pull deeply, with your fingers pointing
downward (b, c). Hold the finish position for a count of two. You should
still be facing down.
3. Bring your hands up to your abdomen and bring your heels in to prepare
for the breaststroke kick (d).
4. Kick your legs and extend your arms directly forward into a streamline
position (e, f).
5. Hold the streamline position for a count of one.
6. Begin your breaststroke.
Focus Points
• Remember this pattern of gliding: three, two, one.
• Practice all the steps.
• Maintain consistent depth.
Tips
• This turn has several steps. Practice by adding one step at a time.
• For an advanced variation, see how far you can travel underwater when
you perform this drill correctly.

142 BREASTSTROKE TURN
Purpose
To perform a proper breaststroke turn. Proper execution is a matter of putting
together three parts—the approach, turn, and pullout.
Procedure
1. Swimming the breaststroke, approach the wall.
2. Unlike with the finish, let your hands touch next to each other on the
wall or on the gutter (a).
3. Perform the two-hand touch turn. Remember the pattern: touch, turn,
under, throw, push (b).
4. Hold the streamline position for a count of three and continue the rest of
the pullout (c).
Focus Points
• Keep your head low on the turn.
• Make your shoulders level before you do the pulldown. Otherwise, the
turn is illegal.
Tip
Bring your knees in as fast as you can after you touch to give you a faster turn.

143 BUTTERFLY FINISH
Purpose
To perform a proper finish for the butterfly.
Procedure
Swimmers commonly shorten their strokes as they approach the wall, but taking
fewer strokes and kicking in while holding a streamline position is faster.
1. Start from 10 to 12 yards (meters) from the wall.
2. Swim the butterfly at full speed toward the wall (a). After you get to the
flags, try to take fewer strokes to the wall and control your breathing.
3. On your last stroke, get your arms completely stretched out in front of
you in a streamline position as you dolphin kick to the wall (b).
4. Drive your head down into the streamline as you finish to the wall. Your
fingertips should touch the wall underwater. Remember, the hands must
touch at the same time. Otherwise, you could be disqualified from a race.
Focus Points
• Finish in a streamline position.
• If you are a little too far to touch right away, kick in.
• Touch underwater.
• Try to take the fewest number of strokes possible for the finish
Tip
If you have to kick in, accelerate your kick to hyperspeed; make it very quick.

144 BUTTERFLY BREAKOUT DRILL
Purpose
To perform a proper butterfly b eakout for the starts and turns.
Procedure
Swimmers often fail to streamline and dolphin kick underwater for a sufficient
distance.
1. Start from the wall. Push off in a streamline position and be sure to
control your depth (a).
2. As soon as you reach the fully extended streamline, begin to dolphin
kick at a quick pace.
3. Get in at least three kicks before beginning your pulling action to start
the stroke.
4. Control your depth so that you break the surface just as you finish
pulling on the first stroke (b). Also, control your breathing for the first
two or three strokes.
Focus Points
• Keep a tight streamline.
• Maintain quick kicking.
• Travel 5 to 10 yards (meters) underwater as quickly as you can.
Tip
Practice dolphin kicking underwater in a streamline as far as you can go. Build-
ing up your breath control during the breakout will help.

146 FLY TO BACK TURN
Purpose
To perform a proper butterfly to backst oke turn.
Procedure
The most common error in the butterfly to backstroke turn is releasing both
hands from the wall at the same time. The mechanics for the turn are the same
as those for the other two-hand touch turns.
1. Start 10 to 12 yards (meters) from the wall. Swim the butterfly at full
speed toward the wall.
2. Let your hands touch next to each other on the wall or on the gutter (a).
3. Perform the two-hand touch turn (b). Remember the pattern: touch, turn,
under, throw, push (but this time remember to throw directly overhead).
On this turn, the feet do not need to twist on the wall, just the shoulders.
4. Get into the streamline position and perform the backstroke breakout (c).
Focus Points
• Keep your head low on the turn.
• Lean your head straight back after the touch.
• Roll your shoulders so that you push off a little on your side.
• Drive the arm back directly over your head.
Tips
• Bring your knees in as fast as you can after you touch to give you a faster
turn.
• Watch your hand release from the wall and drive over your head.

147 BACKSTROKE TO BREASTSTROKE TURN
Purpose
To perform a proper backstroke to breaststroke turn.
Procedure
The backstroke to breaststroke turn has several variations. The open turn,
described next, is the simplest, and it is quite effective.
1. Start 10 to 12 yards (meters) from the wall. Swim the backstroke at full
speed toward the wall.
2. If there is a gutter, rotate your hand on the final stroke so that your palm
is facedown and your thumb extends downward. The fingers will then
slide over the gutter wall.
3. Grab the wall with one hand and pull in your feet underneath you so
that you can place your feet on the wall (a).
4. Drop your head underwater, throw your arm, and streamline into your
breaststroke pullout (b).
5. If there is no gutter, position your hand on the final stroke so that your
fingers are pointing to the opposite side and your thumb is pointing up.
Use your hand to push away from the wall as you position your body
for the push-off.
Focus Points
• Keep your head low on the turn.
• Use just one arm to perform the turn.
Tips
• Bring your knees in as fast as you can after you touch to give you a faster
turn.
• Try not to twist too much on the wall. Being a little on your side is all
right; in fact, it is a lot faster. Just remember that your shoulders have to
be level by the time you do your pulldown.

148 ADVANCED BACKSTROKE TO
BREASTSTROKE TURN, BACK FLIP
Purpose
To perform the reverse flip turn for backst oke to breaststroke.
Procedure
This advanced turn, if executed properly, can be remarkably faster—usually
by 0.8 to 1.1 seconds!
1. Start 10 to 12 yards (meters) from the wall. Swim the backstroke at full
speed toward the wall (a).
2. On the final stroke, drive the hand down low to place the palm on the
wall about 1 or 2 feet (30 to 60 cm) below the surface. Your fingers will
be pointing downward. As you take this last stroke, push your head
underwater as well.
3. As soon as your hand reaches the wall, push away from the wall and
begin to do a reverse somersault in a tuck position, driving the knees in
toward the chest (b). Flip all the way over to place your feet against the
wall. Your body will now be prepared to push off into a streamline (c).
4. Push off the wall into a streamline and perform a breaststroke pullout (d).
Focus Points
• Drive the hand low on the last stroke of the backstroke so that your hand
placement is low enough to aid in the flip
• Get your head underwater on the last stroke.
• Be sure to drive the knees in hard in doing the somersault.
Tips
• Bring your knees in as fast as you can after you touch to give you a faster
turn.
• Anticipate the wall after you flipover so that you can punch off the wall
quickly.

149 ADVANCED BACKSTROKE TO
BREASTSTROKE TURN, CROSSOVER
Purpose
To perform the crossover turn for backstroke to breaststroke.
Procedure
This advanced turn, if executed properly, can be even faster than the back flip
1. Start 10 to 12 yards (meters) from the wall. Swim the backstroke at full
speed toward the wall.
2. On the final stroke, reach your hand behind your ear while staying on
your back (a).
3. As soon as your hand reaches the wall, roll onto your abdomen and begin
to do a forward somersault in a tuck position, driving the knees in toward
the chest (b). Flip all the way over to place your feet against the wall. Your
body will now be prepared to push off into a streamline (c).
4. Push off the wall into a streamline, roll onto your abdomen, and perform
a breaststroke pullout (d).
Focus Points
• Stay on your back while reaching behind your ear to touch the wall. This
step is the most common time when swimmers make a mistake with this
turn.
• Be fully extended when reaching for the wall.
• Be sure to drive the knees in hard in doing the somersault.
Tips
• Flip as fast as you can so that you can push off quickly to perform the
flip turn
• Anticipate the wall after you flipover so that you can punch off the wall
quickly.
• A common mistake is to fliptoo close to the wall when doing the forward
somersault.

speed toward the wall.
2. Let your hands touch next to each other on the wall or on the gutter (a).
3. Perform the two-hand touch turn (b). Remember the pattern: touch, turn,
under, throw, push. Try to push off mostly on your side.
4. Get into the streamline position and do the freestyle breakout (c, d).
Control your breathing for at least two strokes.
Focus Points
• Keep your head low on the turn.
• Control your breathing for the first two st okes of the freestyle.
Tips
• Bring in your knees as fast as you can after you touch to give you a faster
turn.
• The most common error for this turn is failing to perform a streamline.
This turn starts the finalleg of the individual medley when most swim-
mers are tired. A great streamline here yields a distinct advantage.

Chapter 12
Strength Band
Exercises
Sport scientists and coaches of the most successful swimmers recommend
that an extensive dry-land program be introduced at the earliest stages of a
swimmer’s development. Strength training in the beginning of a swimming
career is crucially important because it encourages mastering of swimming
technique. Strength training has become a powerful way both to develop
anaerobic abilities and to strengthen the muscles used during propulsion.
A blend of strength and swimming training may be more productive than
only swimming.
Strength bands have become popular with swimmers and coaches alike.
Bands are versatile. Depending on the type you choose, you can focus on
upper-body pulling and pushing exercises to strengthen the muscles around
the shoulders, or you can target the underused muscles in the lower body
to help improve hip stability. You can even work your entire body as a unit
by establishing a link between the lower body, the core, and the shoulders.
Strength band exercises and drills are a great choice for swimmers for
several reasons:
• Bands primarily cause you to train in a standing position, meaning that
you’ll engage more muscle mass and require more core activation than
you would with other forms of resistance.
• Bands allow you to train at varying speeds, something that is not always
advisable when working with free weights.
• Bands are better suited for adding resistance when attempting to mimic
specific stroke mechanics.
Strength bands can be an excellent addition to your dry-land program
because they offer convenience and versatility.

152 DRY-LAND SWIMMING
Purpose
To warm up the muscles of the shoulders, particularly the upper back and the
rotator cuff, using a swimming-like motion.
Procedure
1. Attach a piece of elastic tubing (of low to moderate resistance) to a fence
or other stationary object and loop one end around each hand.
2. Lean forward at the waist so that your upper body is parallel to the
ground.
3. Perform arm pulls that mimic the swimming strokes.
Focus Point
Take care to maintain proper technique while pulling throughout the exercise.
Tip
Use this exercise to warm up the joints and muscle groups important to swim-
mers.

153 SQUAT
Purpose
To build strength in the gluteal muscles as well as muscles throughout the
lower body.
Procedure
1. Stand on a piece of heavy-resistance elastic band so that your feet are
approximately shoulder-width apart or slightly wider.
2. Grasp one end of the band with each hand and hold your hands at your
hips.
3. Lower yourself into a squat position so that your knees are bent to 90
degrees.
4. Drive with the legs and return to the starting position.
Focus Point
Make sure you maintain normal curvature of the spine. Push the chest out and
up, and do not let the knees come forward past the toes.
Tip
Although you should use weights or elastic bands, you can also use your body
weight for resistance when starting out.

To build strength in the inner thigh and in the gluteal muscles. You perform this
exercise the same way you did the classic squat, except that the foot position
places demands on the muscles of the inner thigh.
Procedure
1. Stand on a piece of heavy-resistance elastic
band so that your feet are wider than
shoulder-width apart and your toes
are pointed slightly outward.
2. Grasp one end of the band with
each hand and hold your
hands at shoulder level.
3. Lower yourself into a squat
position so that your knees are
bent to 90 degrees.
4. Drive with the legs and return
to the starting position.
Focus Points
• The band should be under
strong tension when you are
in the starting position.
• Make sure you maintain
normal curvature of the spine.
• Push the chest out and up.
• Do not let the knees come
forward past the toes.

161 LAT PULLDOWN
Purpose
To develop strength in the lats and the muscles of the upper back, some of the
most important muscles for generating the power behind your pull.
Procedure
1. Loop a piece of elastic tubing over a lifeguard chair, through a fence, or
over anything sturdy above your head.
2. Face the point of attachment and grasp the ends of the band above your
shoulders with your elbows extended forward.
3. Pull the bands down and back by bringing your hands to your chest
while bending your elbows.

Tip
The lats are the muscles that
give many swimmers their
V shape, and swimmers use
them every time they pull.
You will likely want to use
a fairly heavy resistance
when training these muscles
because the lats are among
the strongest muscles in the
body.
