DOPING CONTROL
All athletes should check the status of all medications they plan to take PRIOR to taking them.
This includes over-the-counter and prescription medications. It is the responsibility of the athlete to
ensure that no prohibited substance enters his/her system.
The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) offers a Drug Reference Line (719-785-2000)
and a Drug Reference Online (www.globaldro.com) where athletes, coaches, parents and medical
professionals may check to ensure that proper documentation is on file for their medications and
that they are consuming medications that are permitted.
Dietary supplements are considered “Take at Your Own Risk” as claims made by the
manufacturers/distributors of dietary supplements regarding the effectiveness or contents of their
products are not strictly regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Any commercial
dietary supplement is susceptible to containing substances that may appear on the Prohibited
Substance list(s) of FINA and/or the World Anti-Doping Agency. These substances may not be
listed on the ingredients label of the product. Athletes should visit USADA’s Supplement 411
website for detailed information regarding the supplement industry (including a high-risk list):
http://www.usada.org/substances/supplement-411/
Athletes are also strongly encouraged to check every ingredient of every product they plan to
consume as prohibited substances may be listed as ingredients.
To comply with the 2015 World Anti-Doping Code, FINA, USOC and USADA have all amended
their anti-doping rules. The rules are available at the offices of USA Swimming or may be found
online at the following websites:
WADA www.wada-ama.org
FINA www.fina.org
USOC www.usoc.org
USADA www.usada.org
The 2019 List of Prohibited Substances and Methods is available on the websites listed above.
This List will take effect on January 1, 2019.
U.S. CENTER FOR SAFESPORT
The U.S. Center for SafeSport helpline and resources may be found online at www.safesport.org.
USA SWIMMING POLICY MANUAL
The USA Swimming Policy Manual is available on USA Swimming’s website: usaswimming.org

Except as otherwise noted, all provisions under Part One, the Technical Rules, are effective
beginning May 1, 2019, and until changed. All provisions under Parts Two through Seven 11
are effective beginning January 1, 2019, unless otherwise indicated. Rules in effect on the
first day of a meet shall govern throughout that meet.
PART ONE
TECHNICAL RULES
All competitive swimming events held under USA Swimming sanction shall be conducted in
accordance with the following rules that are designed to provide fair and equitable conditions of
competition.
It is recommended that the LSC and regional short course and long course championships be
held annually and that they be conducted under the rules governing National Championships
(Article 207), subject to available facilities and personnel. Events other than such championships
may use Article 207 as a guide, subject to local conditions and preferences.
It is not the purpose of the Rules and Regulations of USA Swimming (the National
Govenring Body) contained herein to set standards of care for the safety of the swimmer.
The swimmer, the swim coach, the swim club and the local public entity or pool owner
should address safety considerations where events are held.
ARTICLE 101
INDIVIDUAL STROKES AND RELAYS
101.1 STARTS
.1 Equipment — A loudspeaker start system conforming to 103.18, with or without an under-
water recall device, and an electronic strobe signal visible to all manual timers for forward
and backstroke starts, shall be the preferred starting device.
.2 The Start
A At the commencement of each heat, the Referee shall signal to the swimmers by a
short series of whistles to remove all clothing except for swimwear, followed by a long
whistle indicating that they should take and maintain their positions on the starting plat-
form, the deck, or in the water. In backstroke and medley relay events, at the Referee’s
first long whistle, the swimmers shall immediately enter the water and at the second
long whistle shall return without undue delay to the starting position.
B When the swimmers and officials are ready, the Referee shall signal with an out-
stretched arm to the Starter that the swimmers are under the Starter’s control.
C On the Starter’s command “take your mark”, the swimmers shall immediately assume
their starting position, in the forward start, with at least one foot at the front of the start-
ing platform or the deck. Swimmers starting in the water must have at least one hand in
contact with the wall or starting platform. When all swimmers are stationary, the Starter
shall give the starting signal.

101.1
D When a swimmer does not respond promptly to the command "take your mark," the
Starter shall immediately release all swimmers with the command "stand up" upon
which the swimmers may stand up or step off the blocks.
E A swimmer shall not be disqualified for an illegal starting position at the start if the race
is permitted to proceed. Enforcement of the correct starting position is the responsibility
of the Starter.
.3 False Starts
A Any swimmer starting before the starting signal is given shall be disqualified if the Ref-
eree independently observes and confirms the Starter’s observation that a violation
occurred. Swimmers remaining on the starting blocks shall be relieved from their start-
ing positions with the "stand up" command and may step off the blocks.
B If the starting signal has been given before the disqualification is declared, the race
shall continue without recall. If the Referee independently observes and confirms the
Starter’s observation that a violation occurred, the swimmer or swimmers who have
false started shall be disqualified upon completion of the race.
C If the recall signal is activated inadvertently, no swimmer shall be charged with a false
start and the Starter shall restart the race upon signal by the Referee.
D A swimmer who would otherwise be charged with a false start may be relieved of the
charge if the false start was caused by the swimmer’s reaction to the “stand up”
command.
E Declared false start: swimmers reporting to the Referee prior to the start of their race
and declaring their intent not to compete will be disqualified except as noted in
207.11.6D(1).
.4 Warning Signal — With the exception of relays, in events 500 yards or longer, the Starter or

face of the water. The hands shall not be brought back beyond the hip line, except during the
first stroke after the start and each turn.
During each complete cycle, some part of the swimmer’s head shall break the surface of the
water. After the start and after each turn, the swimmer may take one arm stroke completely
back to the legs. The head must break the surface of the water before the hands turn inward
at the widest part of the second stroke.
.3 Kick — After the start and each turn, at any time prior to the first breaststroke kick a single
butterfly kick is permitted. Following which, all movements of the legs shall be simultaneous
and in the same horizontal plane without alternating movement.
The feet must be turned outwards during the propulsive part of the kick. Scissors,
alternating movements or downward butterfly kicks are not permitted except as provided
herein. Breaking the surface of the water with the feet is allowed unless followed by a
downward butterfly kick.
.4 Turns and Finish — At each turn and at the finish of the race, the touch shall be made with
both hands separated and simultaneously at, above, or below the water level. At the last
stroke before the turn and at the finish an arm stroke not followed by a leg kick is permitted.

surface of the water at some point during the last complete or incomplete cycle preceding
the touch.
101.3 BUTTERFLY
.1 Start — The forward start shall be used.
.2 Stroke — After the start and after each turn, the swimmer’s shoulders must be at or past
the vertical toward the breast. The swimmer is permitted one or more leg kicks, but only one
arm pull under water, which must bring the swimmer to the surface. It shall be permissible
for a swimmer to be completely submerged for a distance of not more than 15 meters (16.4
yards) after the start and after each turn. By that point, the head must have broken the sur-
face. The swimmer must remain on the surface until the next turn or finish. From the begin-
ning of the first arm pull, the body shall be kept on the breast except at the turn after the
touch of the wall where it is permissible to turn in any manner as long as the body is on the
breast when leaving the wall. Both arms must be brought forward simultaneously over the
water and pulled back simultaneously under the water throughout the race.
.3 Kick — All up and down movements of the legs and feet must be simultaneous. The position
of the legs or the feet need not be on the same level, but they shall not alternate in relation
to each other. A scissors or breaststroke kicking movement is not permitted.
.4 Turns — At each turn the body shall be on the breast. The touch shall be made with both
hands separated and simultaneously at, above, or below the water surface. Once a touch
has been made, the swimmer may turn in any manner desired. The shoulders must be at or
past the vertical toward the breast when the swimmer leaves the wall.

in contact with the end wall or face of the touchpad. Bending the toes over the top of the
touchpad is prohibited.
.2 Stroke — The swimmer shall push off on his back and continue swimming on the back
throughout the race. Some part of the swimmer must break the surface of the water through-
out the race, except it is permissible for the swimmer to be completely submerged during the
turn and for a distance of not more than 15 meters (16.4 yards) after the start and after each
turn. By that point, the head must have broken the surface of the water.
.3 Turns — Upon completion of each length, some part of the swimmer must touch the wall.
During the turn the shoulders may be turned past the vertical toward the breast after which
an immediate continuous single arm pull or immediate continuous simultaneous double arm
pull may be used to initiate the turn. The swimmer must have returned to a position on the
back upon leaving the wall.
.4 Finish — Upon the finish of the race, the swimmer must touch the wall while on the back.
101.5 FREESTYLE
.1 Start — The forward start shall be used.
.2 Stroke — In an event designated freestyle, the swimmer may swim any style, except that in
a medley relay or an individual medley event, freestyle means any style other than butterfly,
breaststroke or backstroke. Some part of the swimmer must break the surface of the water
throughout the race, except it shall be permissible for the swimmer to be completely sub-
merged during the turn and for a distance of not more than 15 meters (16.4 yards) after the
start and each turn. By that point the head must have broken the surface.

.4 If, due to conditions beyond the meet officials’ control (e.g., a thunderstorm), an event or
events are postponed to a subsequent day of the meet, such postponed events shall not be
included in the above events-per-day limitations.
.5 In a meet where finals for an event(s) are scheduled to be contested on a day subsequent to
preliminaries for that event(s), that finals event(s) shall not be counted in the daily event
limitation.
.6 In a meet where a combination of preliminary and final events and timed finals are scheduled,
a swimmer may compete in not more than three (3) individual events per day, unless entered

2019 Rules & Regulations 25

--- Page 28 Text ---
102.2
which may be established by the LSC’s sanction or approval, shall be clearly stated in the
meet announcement.
.8 In a mixed classification meet a swimmer may enter the same stroke and distance individual
event in an age group and any other classification, provided the limit of events per day for the
type of meet is not exceeded. The same entry time must be used for all repetitive entries.
.9 If a meet or an event has no qualifying time standards, a swimmer who has no official time for
an event may enter that event with no submitted time. Meet hosts may specify in the meet
announcement that swimmers must submit estimated times if they have no official times.
102.3 RELAYS
.1 Relay teams shall not compete unattached. In all cases relay teams must be composed of
USA Swimming members of the same club, school or organization which is a member of USA
Swimming. This requirement does not apply to relay teams representing an LSC at a Zone
meet or similar all-star competition sanctioned or approved by USA Swimming. Foreign relays
competing in USA Swimming sanctioned meets must consist of members of the same foreign
club or may represent their recognized FINA federation if so authorized by that federation.
.2 Relays may be conducted on a timed final basis or with preliminaries and finals.
.3 Organizations entering two or more relay teams in an event shall designate them on the entry
blank as Team A, Team B, etc.
.4 The time of each relay team shall be entered on the entry blank for seeding purposes and no
change in time will be permitted.
.5 First and last names of swimmers eligible to compete in relay events shall be entered in accor-
dance with the meet announcement.
.6 The composition of a relay team may be changed between preliminaries and finals. All mem-
bers competing on a relay team disqualified during preliminaries shall be barred from further
competition in that event.
.7 Names of eligible relay swimmers and order of swimming shall be submitted to the clerk of
course or to the head lane timer. Any changes in names of the competing swimmers or their
order of swimming must be declared to the Head Lane Timer prior to the start of the heat in
which such relay team is entered. No changes will be permitted thereafter.
102.4 SCRATCH PROCEDURES — Each swimmer shall become informed of the meet start-
ing time and shall report to the proper meet authorities promptly upon call. Meet announcements
and advance information shall specify check-in and scratch procedures for individual and relay
events and penalties for violation of those procedures.
102.5 SEEDING, LANE ASSIGNMENTS, SWIM-OFFS, AND ORDER OF HEATS
.1 Preliminary Heats When Finals are Scheduled — Entry times shall be listed by the meet
committee with the fastest swimmer first and the slowest swimmer last. Swimmers whose sub-
mitted times are identical should be assigned places in the list by draw. Swimmers with no sub-
mitted times shall be considered the slowest and shall be placed at the end of the list by draw.
Swimmers shall be seeded in lanes under the procedure outlined for finals seeding in 102.5.
Swimmers shall be seeded in heats according to submitted times in the following manner:
A Fewer than three heats
(1) If there is only one heat, it shall be swum as scheduled during the preliminaries
and finals.
26 2019 Rules & Regulations

--- Page 29 Text ---
102.5
(2) If there are two heats, the fastest swimmer shall be seeded in the second heat,
next fastest in the first heat, next fastest in the second heat, next in the first heat,
next in the second heat, next in the first heat, etc. 1
B Three heats — Except for 400y, 400m/500y, 800m/1000y and 1500m/1650y events,
the fastest swimmer shall be placed in the third heat, next fastest in the second, next in
the first. The fourth fastest swimmer shall be placed in the third heat, the fifth in the sec-
ond heat, and the sixth fastest in the first heat, the seventh fastest in the third heat, etc.
C Four heats or more — Except for 400y, 400m/500y, 800m/1000y and 1500m/1650y
events, the last three heats of an event shall be seeded in accordance with B above.
The heat preceding the last three heats shall consist of the next fastest swimmers; the
heat preceding the last four heats shall consist of the next fastest swimmers, etc. Lanes
shall be assigned in descending order of submitted times within each heat, in accor-
dance with the pattern outlined in 102.5.
D For 400y, 400m/500y, 800m/1000y and 1500m/1650y events, the last two heats of an
event shall be seeded in accordance with 102.5.1A(2).
E Exception — When there are two or more heats in an event, there shall be a minimum
of three swimmers seeded into any one preliminary heat, but subsequent scratches
may reduce the number of swimmers in such heat to less than three.
.2 Swim-Offs — A swim-off is considered to be part of the total preliminary process of qualify-
ing for the finals. In no case may a swimmer with a faster time displace another who placed
ahead of him within a heat as the result of a decision by the Referee or Place Judges in
accordance with Section 102.24. If this situation results in disputed qualifications, all swim-
mers having times tied or within the disputed times shall swim-off to qualify for the disputed
place or places in the final. The swim-off shall be timed and judged in the same manner as
the original event unless a subsequent timing system malfunction requires that an adjust-
ment be made. For the seeding of finals, the times used for the swimmers involved shall be
the times achieved in their original preliminary heats. This elimination may be held at any
time set by the Referee, but not more than 45 minutes after the last heat of any event in
which any one of these swimmers is competing in that session. In the case of a disqualifica-
tion in a swim-off the swimmer so disqualified is relegated to the lowest qualifying position
for which he/she is competing. Disqualification in a swim-off for a qualifying position shall not
eliminate a swimmer from eligibility to compete in the accompanying finals, or as an alter-
nate. If disqualifications leave a vacancy for the full complement of finalists, swim-offs shall
be continued among the disqualified swimmers until a full complement of finalists is assured.
Note: It shall be the swimmer’s responsibility to become acquainted with information per-
taining to swim-offs, final events and the participants therein.
.3 Finals — In finals, the times to be considered are those times made in preliminary heats. If
any qualifying swimmers have the same time, their respective lanes shall be determined by
draw. Lane assignments shall be made in descending order of qualifying times by placing
the fastest swimmer or team in the center lane in a pool with an odd number of lanes, or in
lanes 3, 4, or 5 respectively in pools having 6, 8, or 10 lanes, with the swimmer having the
next fastest time in the adjacent lane, then alternating the other swimmer(s) to the right or
left in accordance with the submitted times. (See chart on next page)

.4 Timed Finals
A Heats — The last heat shall be composed of the swimmers with the fastest submitted
times, the next to last heat composed of the next fastest swimmers, etc. Lanes shall be
assigned in descending order of submitted times within each heat, in accordance with
the pattern outlined in .3 above. When there are two or more heats there shall be a
minimum of three swimmers or relay teams seeded into the first heat. The last heat
should be a full heat, but the requirement of seeding three swimmers or relay teams
into the first heat may result in failure to fill the last heat.
B Places — In timed finals, places shall be determined on a time basis, subject to the
order of finish within each heat and based upon the ranking system used at the meet.
Any ties resulting from the procedure used shall be declared officially tied for awards
and points, with no further attempt at resolution.
.5 Seeding of 50 meter events in a 50 meter course — 50 meter events swum in a 50 meter
course shall be seeded as provided above. If the event is started at the turning end of the
course, no change in the lane numbering shall be made, i.e., the lanes shall be numbered
the same on both ends of the course.
.6 Order of Heats
A Preliminary Heats and Timed Finals — The normal order of heats may be reversed
by swimming the fastest heats first. Women’s and men’s heats may be alternated.
B Finals — The order of heats during the finals of a preliminaries and finals meet may be
reversed, with the B and C (consolation and bonus) heats, if any, swum following the A
(final) heat. In the event of scratches, the empty lanes may be filled by moving the
swimmers up in order from the slower heats and by using the available alternates in the
slowest heat without reseeding the heats. For heats other than team selection finals
where athletes are not provided any recognition other than the opportunity to swim
(e.g., scoring points, earning prize money, etc.) alternates may be inserted into empty
lanes in any heat regardless of order swum.
C The order of heats shall be stated in the meet announcement.

102.6 COUNTERS
A A swimmer in the 500/1000/1650 yard or 800/1500 meter freestyle or other long dis-
1
tance pool event (see 102.1.3) may appoint one counter to call lengths or indicate
lengths by visual sign.
B Verbal counters shall be limited to one per swimmer and shall be stationed at the end
of the course opposite the starting end. They may use watches and signal intermediate
times to the swimmer.
C If visual counters are used, they may be stationed at the end or either side of the pool,
beyond the halfway point toward the end of the course opposite the starting end. Visual
counters may be lowered into the water at the end of the swimmer’s lane, provided that,
in the opinion of the Referee, they neither physically aid the swimmer nor interfere with
another swimmer or present any safety hazard.
D The count may be in ascending or descending order.
E In the event of official or counter error, it is the responsibility of the swimmer to com-
plete the prescribed distance.
102.7 POSTPONEMENTS AND CHANGES IN PROGRAM
.1 The order of events, as stated in the meet announcement, shall not be changed. The
announced arrangement of heats in any event shall not be added to or altered, except by
the authority of the Referee, to the extent of consolidating the heats.
.2 At the Meet Referee’s discretion, events may be combined by age, gender, distance, and/or
stroke provided there is at least one empty lane between such combined events. The Ref-
eree may waive the empty lane requirement with the concurrence of the coaches of the
affected swimmers.
.3 The entry provisions and starting time of any event, meet or portion thereof shall stand as
stated in the meet announcement (except as permitted under .4 below) and may not be
changed to an earlier time or date unless written notice of such change is delivered to all
affected swimmers or their coaches. If mailed, such notice must be postmarked no later than
the entry deadline date stated on the meet announcement, and if lack of time prohibits mail
notification, all affected swimmers or their coaches must voluntarily agree in writing that they
have been notified and are in accord with such change. Any affected swimmer or his or her
coach may file a written protest with the Referee prior to running of the event or meet if they
do not agree to such change in time or date.
.4 Postponement or Cancellation
A If, prior to its commencement, unusual or severe weather or other conditions preclude
the possibility of safely and effectively conducting a meet or an event, the meet commit-
tee may cancel or postpone it. Meets postponed to a start date within fourteen (14)
days from the original start date shall define age as the first day of the original meet.
Meets postponed to a date more than fourteen (14) days from the original start date
shall define age as the first day of the rescheduled meet.
B If, after commencement, conditions preclude the possibility of safely and effectively
conducting a meet or an event, the meet committee may cancel or postpone. If post-
poned to continue within fourteen (14) days of the date of postponement, age of the
2019 Rules & Regulations 29

--- Page 32 Text ---
102.7
swimmers shall not change. If postponed to continue at a date beyond fourteen (14)
days of the date of postponement, age of the swimmers shall change to the first day of
the rescheduled events.
C Should a meet or event have actually commenced, and in the judgment of the Referee
cannot safely and effectively continue because of weather conditions, or for some other
compelling reason, the Referee, in his/her sole discretion, may suspend the meet or
event until conditions warrant continuance. If circumstances do not warrant continu-
ance, the Referee may cancel the meet or event, or postpone it to a future date or time,
with the approval of the meet committee.
D A decision to cancel or postpone shall be final.
E Should an event have actually commenced but is terminated prior to an official finish,
and is postponed to another time or date, it shall then be conducted between the swim-
mers who were officially competing in the event at the time of the termination.
F Incomplete events will not be awarded or scored; however, times achieved in accor-
dance with 102.24 up to the point of cancellation shall be considered official.
G Entry fees for teams or swimmers may be refunded, in whole or part, at the discretion
of the meet committee, upon cancellation of a meet or particular event. The decision of
the meet committee on refunding may be appealed to the LSC Administrative Board or
Zone Board of Review for hearing under the provisions of Part Four.

A Performance Requirements
(1) An official time can be achieved only in USA Swimming sanctioned or USA Swim-
ming approved competition, or in an observed swim in accordance with all appli-
cable rules. It may be achieved in:
(a) Any heat.
(b) A swim-off.
(c) A lead-off leg in a relay.
(d) A split time recorded from the official start to the completion of an initial dis-
tance with a legal finish within a longer event, provided the swimmer com-
pletes the event or the lead-off portion of the relay in compliance with
applicable rules.
(e) A time trial or a record attempt.
(2) An official time for an event or a stroke can be achieved only in that event or
stroke, or in an initial distance of such event or stroke (e.g. a backstroke time
must be achieved in a backstroke event or the backstroke leg of a medley relay).
Regardless of the stroke(s) used, times achieved in freestyle events can be
recorded only as freestyle times.
B Timing Resolution — All timing systems, including manual watches, shall have a reso-
lution of one one-hundredth of a second (0.01 second). Times from all systems shall be
2019 Rules & Regulations 39

--- Page 42 Text ---
102.24
recorded to hundredths of a second. The digits representing thousandths shall be
dropped with no rounding.
C System Requirements for Specific Purposes
(1) Official times achieved using a timing system in accordance with 102.24.3 are
valid for all entry time and recognition program purposes with the following excep-
tion: World, American, and U.S. Open Records can be established only when
timed by an automatic timing system, a backup camera system, or semiautomatic
system if the automatic system fails.
(2) A backup time adjusted as described in 102.24.4 may be used as an official time.
D Backup Timing System Requirement — Except when the primary system consists of
watches, backup timing shall be provided for all competitors. No swimmer shall be
required to re-swim a race due to equipment failure which results in unrecorded or inac-
curate time or place. It is the Meet Director’s responsibility to provide the proper timing
systems so that swimmers can expect to achieve official times that will satisfy the
requirements of 102.24.1C.
E Use of Secondary and Tertiary Times — Secondary and tertiary times shall be
recorded but shall not be used except to corroborate or correct missing or inaccurate
primary/secondary results.
.2 Timing Systems — Every race in a swimming competition shall be timed with one or more
of the following systems, listed in their preferred order of use:
A Automatic — A timing system activated by a starting device and stopped at the finish
by the swimmer touching the touchpad.
B Semi-Automatic — A timing system activated by a starting device and stopped by but-
tons pushed by timers at the finish touch of the swimmer.
C Manual — A timing system consisting of individual lane timers, each operating a man-
ual watch that is both started and stopped by the timer as described in 102.17.3. Only
hand-held, battery-powered, digital read-out type watches designed for timing purposes
shall be used.
.3 Timing System Designation — Timing systems shall be designated in the order in which
results are used as follows:
A Primary System — The primary system shall determine the official time of each swim-
mer unless a comparison of the primary with secondary and/or tertiary system times
indicates a malfunction of the primary system. A primary system shall always be in
place and shall consist of one of the following, listed in their preferred order of use:
(1) Automatic Timing.
(2) Semi-Automatic, with three (3) or two (2) buttons per lane, each operated by a
separate timer.
(3) Manual, with three (3) watches per lane, each operated by a separate timer.
B Secondary System — If manually operated watches are not the primary system, a
secondary system of precedence equal to or lower than the primary system must be
used. The secondary system may be:
(1) Stationary overhead video cameras recording 100 images per second. The cam-
eras must be fully integrated with the primary timing system.
40 2019 Rules & Regulations

--- Page 43 Text ---
102.24
(2) Semi-Automatic with one (1), two (2), or three (3) buttons, each operated by a
separate timer.
1
(3) Manual with one (1), two (2) or three (3) watches per lane, each operated by a
separate timer.
C Tertiary System — Unless the primary system consists of manual watches or the sec-
ondary system is a fully integrated video system or includes at least one (1) manual
watch per lane, a tertiary system of at least one (1) manual watch per lane shall be
provided.
.4 Determining Official Time
A Automatic Timing — When recorded by properly operating automatic timing equip-
ment, the pad time shall be the official time.
B Semi-Automatic and Manual Timing — Whenever semi-automatic or manual timing is
used, only valid times shall be used in calculating the official time. The times shall be
determined as follows:
(1) If two of the three valid button or watch times agree, that shall be the time for that
timing system.
(2) If three valid buttons or watches disagree, the time of the intermediate button or
watch shall be the time for that timing system.
(3) If only two valid button or watch times are available, the time shall be the average
of those two buttons or the average of the two watch times. The digits represent-
ing thousandths of a second shall be dropped with no rounding.
(4) If only one button or watch time is available, the time of that button or watch shall
be the time for that timing system unless that time conflicts with other information.
If such a conflict exists, the Administrative Official shall gather as much data as
possible and determine the time.
C Primary Timing System Malfunction — A malfunction may have occurred if:
(1) The difference between the time obtained by the primary system and the back-up
system(s) is approximately .30 second or greater; or
(2) The place judge(s) reports a different order of finish; or
(3) It is reported the swimmer missed the touchpad or had a soft touch.
D Adjustment for Malfunction on a Lane — When a malfunction is confirmed on a lane,
the back-up times for that lane shall be calculated in accordance with 102.24.4B and
integrated with the accurate primary times in establishing the official time and determin-
ing the results.
E Adjustment for Malfunction Equally Affecting an Entire Heat — When, because of
an early or late start, or other equipment or operator malfunction, the time of the auto-
matic or semi-automatic primary timing system is equally incorrect for all the lanes in a
heat, but the order of finish and thus the absolute difference of time between the swim-
mers is accurate, the times of the primary system shall be adjusted by calculating the
average difference between the primary times and the valid back-up times and adding,
or subtracting when appropriate, that difference to the primary times of every lane in
that heat. (See Appendix 1 on page 44)
2019 Rules & Regulations 41

102.24
.5 Determining Results
A Place and Ranking — The results shall be by integration of official times including
those times adjusted in accordance with 102.24.4.
B Ties — Official times identical to the hundredths shall be ties, with swim-offs as
required to determine qualifiers or alternates for semi-final, consolation or final heats.
C Judging — Judging shall only be used to change the results produced by ranking the
Official Times if:
(1) The swimmers competed in the same heat,
(2) Times obtained from properly operating automatic timing equipment are not avail-
able, and
(3) The Place Judges both observed a different relative order of finish and made a
written record of their observation immediately following the conclusion of that
heat.
Note: A different relative order of finish means there is agreement that a different
swimmer finished ahead of another swimmer; there need not be agreement on
their exact placement within the heat.
D Impact of Judging on Order of Finish — If judging changes the results:
(1) In timed finals meets and the finals of preliminaries and finals meets, such place-
ment by judges decision (JD) shall be indicated in the meet results.
(2) In the preliminaries of preliminaries and finals meets, in no case may a swimmer
with a faster time displace a swimmer who was judged to have placed ahead of
him within a heat according to 102.24.5C. If this should result in disputed qualifi-
cations, all swimmers having times tied or within the disputed times shall swim-off
for the disputed places in accordance with 102.5.2.

the LSC sanctioning the meet shall establish the scoring point values to suit the format of
the meet. These point values shall be stated in the meet announcement.
.5 Ties — Where two or more swimmers tie for any place in any event, the points credited to
such place or places, if any, next in order shall be equally divided between such swimmers;
i.e., if two tie for first place, the points to be credited to first place and the points to be cred-
ited to second place shall be added and divided one-half and one-half. If three tie for first
place, the points credited to first, second and third places shall be added and divided one-
third, one-third and one-third, and so on for four or more tying for first place. The same is
true for those tying for second place, third place, and whatever places there may be.
.6 Disqualifications — When a relay team or individual swimmer is disqualified, the subse-
quent places will move up accordingly and points shall be awarded to conform to the new
places. Consolation finalists shall not receive championship final placing. Alternates shall
not receive consolation final placing.
102.26 AWARDS — When two or more swimmers tie for any place, duplicate awards shall be
given to each of such tied swimmers. In such cases no awards shall be given for the place or

ARTICLE 105
GUIDELINES FOR OFFICIATING SWIMMERS WITH A DISABILITY
1
IN USA SWIMMING MEETS
105.1 GENERAL
.1 Authority — The USA Swimming Rules & Regulations grant the Referee the authority to
modify the rules for the swimmer with a disability. Disability is defined as a permanent physi-
cal or cognitive disability that substantially limits one or more major life activities. This sec-
tion contains guidelines and suggestions for making such modifications. Reference 701.24
for Open Water competitions.
.2 Responsibilities
A Swimmer — The swimmer (or the swimmer's coach) is responsible for notifying the
Referee, prior to the competition, of any disability of the swimmer and of the requested
modification. The swimmer/coach shall provide any assistant(s) or equipment (tappers,
deck mats, etc.) if required.
B Referee — The Referee’s responsibilities include:
(1) Determining if the requested modifications are appropriate and can be met.
(2) Instructing the Starter and Stroke & Turn officials as to the accommodations to be
made for that swimmer.
.3 Modifications — Aids to buoyancy or speed are not allowed (See 102.8.1E). Some of the
modifications which the Referee may make to accommodate the swimmer with a disability
are:
A A change in starting position.
B Reassignment of lanes within a heat, e.g., exchanging Lanes 2 and 7.
C Allowing the swimmer to have a personal assistant(s). A personal assistant is not
required to be a member of USA Swimming unless acting in a coaching capacity.
Other allowable modifications are further described in this section under the type of disability.
105.2 BLIND AND VISION LOSS
.1 Start — With an audible starting system, no modification is usually required for a swimmer
who is blind or has vision loss. A swimmer may, however, require assistance getting to and
on the block. Should the swimmer feel insecure starting from the block or deck, an in-the-
water start is allowed.
.2 Turns and Finishes — A swimmer who is blind or has vision loss is permitted to have per-
sonal assistants (“tappers” who use poles with soft-tipped ends to tap the swimmer as notifi-
cation of turns and the finish). Sound devices shall not be used. It is the swimmer’s
responsibility to provide the tapper(s), who shall be positioned within the confines of the
swimmer’s lane at the ends of the pool.
.3 Relay Take-Offs — A physical touch may be required to signal the relay swimmer when his/
her teammate has touched the wall. The specific method may be tailored to the swimmer’s
preference so long as it does not aid the swimmer’s take-off or interfere with the timing.

D. Arm moves to side of body — starting signal E. Arm moves to side of body — starting signal
.1 Deaf and hard of hearing swimmers require a visual starting signal, i.e., a strobe light and/or
Starter’s arm signals. The Referee may reassign lanes within the swimmer’s heat, i.e., exchang-
ing one lane for another, so that the strobe light or Starter’s arm signal can more readily be
seen by the deaf or hard of hearing swimmer. Standard Starter’s arm signals are shown in Fig-
ures 1 and 2. A false start rope is required in the event of a recall, provided the meet host is
notified by the entry deadline that a deaf or hard of hearing swimmer will be participating.
.2 Strobe Light Location — The Starter shall advise the swimmers about the location of the
strobe light and the light shall be located where the swimmers can clearly see it for the start.
For backstroke starts, the light should be positioned so that the swimmers don’t have to turn
their heads to look backwards.
105.4 COGNITIVELY DISABLED — A swimmer may be permitted to have an assistant on the
deck when necessary. No other specific rule modifications are required other than patience and
clarity in communicating instructions.
105.5 PHYSICAL DISABILITIES
.1 Start — Swimmers with physical disabilities:
A May take longer to assume their starting position;
B May have difficulty holding the starting platform or pool end for a start;
C May need assistance from someone on the deck to maintain a starting position;
D May use a modified starting position on the blocks, deck or in the water.
E Shall use a forward start for freestyle, breaststroke and butterfly. The Referee, however,
may allow modifications such as the following:
(1) The swimmer may start from a sitting position on the block or on the deck;
56 2019 Rules & Regulations

--- Page 59 Text ---
105.5
(2) The swimmer may assume a starting position in the water, with or without assistance;
(3) If the swimmer cannot use a hand and/or foot to maintain contact with the wall,
1
some other part of the body may be used.
(4) For breaststroke and butterfly, after the start and after each turn, a swimmer who
is unable to push off with the leg(s) may perform one arm stroke that need not be
simultaneous or on the horizontal plane to attain the breast position.
Examples of modified starting positions are shown in Figures 3 through 7.

FIGURE 5 — Unassisted in-the-water forward start FIGURE 6 — Assisted in-the-water forward start
.2 Stroke/Kick — In judging the stroke or kick of a swim-
mer with a physical disability, the Referee and Stroke & FIGURE 7 — Assisted on
block or deck forward start
Turn Judge should follow the general rule that: if a part
of the body is absent or cannot be used, it is not judged;
if it is used during the stroke or kick, it should be judged
in accordance with the USA Swimming Rules and Reg-
ulations.
Judgments should be made based on the actual rule —
not on the swimmer’s technique. For example, the
breaststroke swimmer with one arm or leg shorter than
the other, may have a non-symmetrical stroke or kick,
but as long as the arm or leg action is simultaneous, it
would meet that portion of the rule. No flotation devices
should be permitted.
2019 Rules & Regulations 57

--- Page 60 Text ---
105.5
.3 Turn/Finishes
A Touches shall be judged in the same manner as strokes and kicks, i.e., on the basis of
the arm(s) and/or hand(s) that the swimmer can use. In breaststroke and butterfly
events, the competitor must reach forward as if attempting a simultaneous two-hand
touch. When a swimmer has a different arm length, only the longer arm must touch the
wall, but both arms must be stretched forward simultaneously. Swimmers with no arms
or with upper limbs too short to stretch above the head may touch the wall with any part
of the upper body.
B At the turn and finish of the butterfly, an athlete with no leg function is permitted to per-
form a partial stroke with the arm(s) recovering forward under the surface of the water
in order to touch the wall.
.4 Relays — Relay swimmers who cannot exit the water immediately may be allowed to
remain in the lane until all relays have finished so long as they do not interfere with the
other swimmers or the timing equipment.

SANCTIONS AND APPROVALS
(See page 153 regarding Dual-Sanctioned Events)
202.1 JURISDICTION — As the National Governing Body for competitive swimming in the United
States and as a Federation member of FINA, USA Swimming has the sole and exclusive authority
to sanction or approve domestic and international swimming competition conducted within its juris-
diction. Each Local Swimming Committee (LSC) has been authorized by USA Swimming to issue
the sanction or approval for all swimming competition and benefits, exhibitions, clinics and enter-
tainment involving competitive swimming within its geographical boundaries, except that USA
Swimming shall sanction national swimming competitions as defined by the President/CEO or his/
her designee. Additional requirements/conditions for sanction or approval, other than those listed in
Article 202, may be established by a vote of the LSC House of Delegates in accordance with LSC
Bylaws.
202.2 SANCTION AND APPROVAL PROCEDURE
.1 An LSC shall establish submission deadlines for sanction or approval applications and shall
publish such deadlines, along with relevant instructions and forms.
.2 LSCs shall establish and publish policies regarding applications submitted after published
deadlines, citing relevant fees and penalties.
.3 If an application is denied, the LSC shall provide written notification within ten (10) days to
the applicant of the reasons for the denial and of the appeals process.

receiving notification of denial by an LSC.
C When an appeal is filed, the Zone Director shall notify the LSC and appoint a panel
made up of a coach, referee and athlete, each from a different LSC and none from the
petitioner’s LSC.
.2 The Zone Sanction Appeal Panel is authorized to require an LSC to issue a sanction or
approval except in those instances where the sanction or approval was denied because the
application was in conflict with a policy adopted by the LSC House of Delegates or because
the application was in conflict with USA Swimming rules or requirements.
.3 The Zone Sanction Appeal Panel’s decision shall be final.
202.4 REQUIREMENTS FOR SANCTION — Sanctions are issued, withheld or withdrawn in
accordance with the following regulations:
.1 Sanctions may be issued only to USA Swimming group members or LSCs and their subdivi-
sions.
.2 No sanction for domestic competition will be issued to any organization or person whose
interest in swimming competition is purely commercial, or where the event is to be promoted
solely for the profit or the advertising value to be derived therefrom. Any income derived
from sanctioned events must be used for the further promotion of swimming, for an
approved charity, or for the general welfare of the promoting organization as a whole.
.3 Sanctions issued to one organization cannot be transferred to another. Any sanction so
transferred shall be void for all purposes, and the LSC is empowered to deny further sanc-
tions to any organization violating this provision.
.4 No further sanction shall be given to any organization which has failed to satisfy expense
obligations to athletes or to award prizes as stated in its meet announcement until the obli-
gations are satisfied or the prizes awarded.
.5 No sanction will be granted for any event for which the word “Olympic,” the word “Paralym-
pic” or any derivative thereof, is used in any manner in connection with said event unless
consent is obtained from USA Swimming.
.6 No sanction shall be granted where unattached status is used as a basis by which a host
club or LSC prohibits participation. However, a host club or LSC may require unattached
swimmers to arrange for their own coach supervision before allowing them to participate.
.7 Applicants for sanction of an open water competition shall complete the application
approved by USA Swimming. Before an open water competition is sanctioned by the LSC,
the LSC sanction officer shall submit the completed sanction packet to USA Swimming for
review and approval.
.8 All sanctions must be signed by a designated member of the LSC, and a record thereof
must be retained.

of events on the day in which the protested swimmer competes, but no later than the
last night of the championships. The opportunity to be heard shall be given to both the
party lodging the protest and the party or parties charged.
D Until the Eligibility Jury renders a decision, the swimmer may compete under protest.
An announcement to this effect shall be made prior to the race. The results of any race
conducted under protest shall not be announced, nor prizes awarded, nor points scored
until the jury has determined if and how their decision may affect the final scoring or
awards.

shall be thirty (30) minutes after the time established for the start of the finals sessions.
C In all events where preliminary heats are necessary or in any timed final event for
which the swimmer has been positively checked in, after the heats have been seeded,
any swimmer who fails to compete in an individual event heat in which such swimmer
entered and has not been scratched in accordance with sub-paragraphs A and B above
will be barred from all further individual and relay events of that day. The application of
2019 Rules & Regulations 79

--- Page 82 Text ---
207.11
this penalty shall pertain to the order in which the event/heats are swum, not the
numerical order of the events. Additionally that swimmer shall not be seeded in any
individual events on succeeding days unless that swimmer declares an intent to swim
prior to the close of the scratch box for that day’s events.
D Scratching from finals:
(1) Any swimmer qualifying for a C, B, or A (bonus and consolation final or) final race
in an individual event who fails to compete in said final shall be barred from fur-
ther competition for the remainder of the meet, except as noted in paragraph E. A
declared false start under 101.1.3E or deliberate delay of meet under 101.1.5 is
not permitted and will be regarded as a failure to compete.
(2) In the event of withdrawal or barring of a swimmer from competition the Referee
shall fill the C, B, or A (bonus and consolation final or) final, when possible, with
the next qualified swimmer(s). First and second alternates shall be announced
along with the final qualifiers. These alternates shall not be penalized if unavail-
able to compete in the finals.
(3) Where C and B (bonus and consolation) finals have not been swum and a barring
or withdrawal is known to the Referee, the Referee shall reseed the C, B and A
(bonus final and consolation final and the) final, if necessary, to insert the
alternate(s) in the appropriate lane(s), filling all lanes in the final.
(4) If the C and B (bonus and consolation) finals have already been contested, the
(championship) final shall be swum without reseeding for the empty lane(s).
E Exceptions for Failure to compete — No penalty shall apply for failure to withdraw or
compete in an individual event if:
(1) The Referee is notified in the event of illness or injury and accepts the proof
thereof.
(2) A swimmer qualifying for a C, B, or A (bonus or consolation final or) final race
based upon the results of the preliminaries notifies the Referee within thirty (30)
minutes after announcement of the qualifiers for that race that they may not
intend to compete and further declares their final intentions within thirty (30) min-
utes following their last individual preliminary event.
(3) It is determined by the Referee that failure to compete is caused by circum-
stances beyond the control of the swimmer.
F Notwithstanding the provisions of 207.11.6, the scratch procedures for a selection meet
for the United States teams for the Olympic Games, the FINA World Championships,
the Pan Pacific Championships, the Pan American Games or the World University
Games shall be established by the National Team Steering Committee and the Pro-
gram & Events Committee Chair or designee.

will be arranged in time order followed by non-conforming yard times; in a short
course meet, non-conforming long course times shall precede non-conforming 2
short course times.
(3) Conforming bonus times, if permitted, will be arranged in time order after the
times that meet the qualifying standards, in the precedence specified in (2)
above.
(4) Non-conforming bonus times, if permitted, will be arranged in time order after the
times that meet the qualifying standard and after conforming bonus times, in the
precedence specified in (2) above.
(5) After arranging the times as provided above, the event will be seeded in normal
fashion.
.8 Finals — Except for the relay events, the 1000 and 1650-yard and 800 and 1500-meter
freestyle events, there shall be C, B, and A (bonus, consolation and championship) final
heats, with the consolation heats preceding the championship heat, in both short course
and long course National Championships. The order of final heats for each meet shall be
approved by the Program & Events Committee Chair or designee.

MEMBER RIGHTS
301.1 Except as provided in 301.2, no individual or organizational member of USA Swimming,
nor any organization affiliated with USA Swimming, may deny or threaten to deny any eligible
swimmer, coach, trainer, manager, official or administrator the opportunity to participate in any
international swimming competition approved by USA Swimming, if selected by USA Swimming 3
or one of its members. In addition, except as provided in 301.2, no individual or organizational
member of USA Swimming, nor any organization affiliated with USA Swimming, may censor or
otherwise penalize subsequent to the event any swimmer, coach, trainer, manager, official or
administrator for having participated in any such international swimming competition approved by
USA Swimming.
301.2 An educational institution which a swimmer is attending at the time of such international
competition may deny the swimmer the opportunity to participate only if said educational institu-
tion reasonably determines that such participation would either:
.1 Prevent the swimmer from meeting the academic requirements which are applicable to all
students who participate in the swimmer’s particular course of study.
.2 Jeopardize the swimmer’s or the educational institution’s performance in the established
program in the particular sport in which the swimmer competes, provided that the interna-
tional competition occurs during the scheduled competitive season of the educational insti-
tution.
301.3 Any swimmer, coach, trainer, manager, official or administrator who alleges that he or
she has been denied or is about to be denied, by a person or an organization affiliated with USA
Swimming, a right as set forth in 301.1, shall immediately inform the Chief Executive Officer, who
shall promptly cause an investigation to be made and steps to be taken to settle the controversy
without unnecessary delay. Such steps shall include, but shall not be limited to, advising the Sec-
retary General of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and submitting the matter to the American Arbi-
tration Association for binding arbitration.
301.4 Whenever a swimmer, or party acting on a swimmer's behalf, informs the Chief Execu-
tive Officer of an alleged violation of the swimmer’s right to participation as set forth in 301.1, the
Chief Executive Officer shall review all the related evidence of the case and make a report, with
a preliminary recommendation, to the National Board of Review within thirty (30) days, or sooner
if the situation requires. The Board of Review shall review the case and the preliminary recom-
mendation of the Chief Executive Officer and take whatever action it deems appropriate. Any of
the parties involved in the action who are dissatisfied with the decision of the National Board of
Review may appeal said decision under the provisions set forth in Article 409.

ELIGIBILITY
303.1 It shall be the responsibility of all USA Swimming members to comply with the rules and regula-
tions of USA Swimming and the Rules, Constitution and Bureau decisions of FINA, as well as to avoid
acting in any manner which brings disrepute upon USA Swimming or upon the sport of swimming.
303.2 Except as provided for in 203.9, only athlete members of USA Swimming are eligible to
compete.
303.3 As a member National Governing Body of the United States Olympic Committee
(USOC), and as a member Federation of Federation Internationale de Natation (FINA), USA
Swimming is obligated to adhere to the anti-doping rules of the USOC and FINA. In addition,
USOC Bylaw Chapter XXIII, Section 2(G) provides that, as a condition of membership in the
USOC, each National Governing Body shall comply with the procedures pertaining to drug test-
ing and adjudication of related doping offenses of the independent anti-doping organization des-

ignated by the USOC to conduct drug testing. The USOC has designated the United States
Anti-Doping Agency (“USADA”) as that organization. The current anti-doping rules of the USOC,
FINA and USADA are available at the offices of USA Swimming or on line at the following web-
sites:
WADA www.wada-ama.org
FINA www.fina.org
USOC www.usoc.org
USADA www.usada.org
As a condition of membership in USA Swimming, it is the responsibility of each athlete member
of USA Swimming to comply with the anti-doping rules of FINA, USOC and USADA and to sub-
mit, without reservation or condition, to in-competition and out-of-competition doping controls
conducted by either FINA or USADA. (Out-of-competition doping controls by USADA may take
place at USA Swimming elite-level camps, training sessions at USOC facilities, or with no
advance notice any time for athletes designated by USA Swimming and USADA for inclusion in
3
USA Swimming’s no advance notice testing pool.)
Pursuant to USOC Bylaw Chapter XXIII, Section 2(G), the management of positive and elevated
test results for USA Swimming athletes has become the responsibility of USADA. Any inconsis-
tent provisions elsewhere in USA Swimming rules are hereby superseded. USA Swimming will,
without further process, enforce and publish any sanction communicated to USA Swimming by
USADA resulting from adjudication of a doping control under the USADA Protocol for Olympic
Movement Testing.
303.4 A swimmer shall cease to be eligible to compete in events conducted by USA Swimming
or its LSCs, or by any FINA Federation, while under suspension or if expelled by USA Swimming
for violations of this Part Three.
303.5 No Individual Member or Group Member of USA Swimming shall coach, train or provide
swimming-related advice or service to any swimmer who is serving a period of ineligibility or pro-
visional suspension for an anti-doping rule violation. In accordance with policies and procedures
in the USA Swimming Policy Manual, Coaches and Group Members are required to report any
non-member of USA Swimming ranked in the top 100 in the world who participates in team activ-
ities.
303.6 If a swimmer is required to forfeit any medals, points or prizes earned at an event on
account of an anti-doping rule violation, then any compensation paid by USA Swimming to the
swimmer’s coach(es) on account of that swimmer’s result shall also be forfeited and shall be
returned to USA Swimming.
303.7 A swimmer may be registered for USA Swimming and Masters Swimming at the same
time. Membership in U.S. Masters Swimming does not imply or presume membership in USA
Swimming.
303.8 A swimmer declared ineligible for any reason may be reinstated pursuant to the provi-
sions of Article 404.

ARTICLE 304
CODE OF CONDUCT
304.1 The mission of USA Swimming is to encourage participation and the pursuit of excel-
lence in all aspects of swimming. USA Swimming grants the privilege of membership to individu-
als and organizations committed to that mission. The privilege of membership may, therefore, be
withdrawn or denied by USA Swimming at any time where USA Swimming determines that a
member or prospective member's conduct is inconsistent with the mission of the organization or
the best interest of the sport and those who participate in it.
In order to assist all members to better serve the interests of those who participate in swimming,
USA Swimming has adopted this Code of Conduct.

the jurisdiction of the Board of Review. Any member, former member, or prospective member of
USA Swimming may be denied membership, censured, placed on probation, suspended for a
definite or indefinite period of time with or without terms of probation, fined or expelled from USA
Swimming for life if such person violates the provisions of the USA Swimming Code of Conduct,
set forth in 304.3, or aids, abets or encourages another person to violate any of the provisions of

against any member or participant on the basis of age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, reli-
gion, sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity, genetics, mental or physical
disability, or any other status protected by federal, state or local law, where applicable, is
prohibited.

age an athlete who is already a member of a USA Swimming member swim club to leave
that club, unless the acting party receives prior written approval to recruit or encourage the
athlete to change affiliation from the designated club representative of the athlete's existing
USA Swimming-member swim club or contact is initiated by the athlete, the athlete's parent
or authorized representative. General advertising includes any information that is:

ARTICLE 305
ATHLETE PROTECTION POLICIES
The following policies related to Athlete Protection are mandatory components of the USA Swim-
ming Code of Conduct:
305.1 Inappropriate touching between an athlete and an adult non-athlete member or Partici-
pating Non-Member (as defined in 401.1) is prohibited, including, but not limited to, excessive
touching, hugging, kissing, and having an athlete sit on a non-family member adult’s lap.
305.2 Any inappropriate sexual conduct or advance, or other inappropriate oral, written, visual,
or physical conduct of a sexual nature at any time, past or present toward any person under the
age of eighteen (18) by (i) a coach member or other non-athlete member, or (ii) any other adult
participating in any capacity whatsoever in the activities of USA Swimming (whether such adult is
a member or not) is prohibited.
305.3 Any rubdown or massage performed on an athlete by any adult member or Participating
Non-Member, excluding the spouse, parent, guardian, sibling, or personal assistant of such ath-
lete, is prohibited unless such adult is a licensed massage therapist or other certified profes-
sional. Any rubdown or massage performed at a swim venue by a licensed professional must be
conducted in open/public locations and must never be done with only the athlete and licensed
massage therapist in the room. Even if a coach is a licensed massage therapist, the coach shall
not perform a rubdown or massage of an athlete under any circumstances.
305.4 Use of audio or visual recording devices, including a cell phone camera, is not allowed in
changing areas, rest rooms or locker rooms.
305.5 Employees and volunteers of USA Swimming, Zones, LSCs and member clubs who interact
directly and frequently with athletes as a regular part of their duties and individuals with any owner-
ship interest in a member club must be non-athlete members of USA Swimming and satisfactorily
complete criminal background checks as required by USA Swimming. This does not apply to volun-
teers such as timers, marshals, computer operators, etc., who only have limited contact with athletes
during a meet. Any individual who is banned, currently suspended or ineligible for membership is pro-
hibited from serving as a timer, marshal, or computer operator, or otherwise being on deck at any
time in connection with a USA Swimming activity.
305.6 TRAVEL
.1 Regardless of gender, a coach shall not share a hotel room or other sleeping arrangement
with an athlete unless the coach is the parent, guardian, sibling, or spouse of that particular
athlete.
.2 Team managers and chaperones must be members of USA Swimming and have success-
fully passed a USA Swimming-required criminal background check.
.3 When only one athlete and one coach travel to a competition, the athlete must have his/her
parent's (or legal guardian’s) written permission in advance to travel alone with the coach.
96 2019 Rules & Regulations

--- Page 99 Text ---
305.6
.4 Clubs and LSCs shall develop their own travel policies. USA Swimming will provide a model
club travel policy as an example. Club travel policies must be signed and agreed to by all
athletes, parents, coaches and other adults traveling with the club.
305.7 Clubs shall establish their own action plans for implementing USA Swimming’s anti-bully-
ing policy. USA Swimming shall provide a model plan as an example which shall serve as the
default for any club that fails to establish its own plan. Club anti-bullying plans must be reviewed
and agreed to annually by all athletes, parents, coaches and other non-athlete members of the
club.
305.8 Clubs shall establish their own electronic communication/social media policy. USA Swim-
ming shall provide a model policy as an example, which shall serve as the default for any club
that fails to establish its own policy. Club electronic communication policies should be reviewed
and agreed to annually by all athletes, parents, coaches and other non-athlete members of the
club.

ARTICLE 306
SEXUAL MISCONDUCT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
306.1 It is every member’s responsibility to promptly report any incident regarding sexual
misconduct by a member as described in the SafeSport Code for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic
Movement to the U.S. Center for SafeSport. Reporting must occur when an individual has firsthand
knowledge of misconduct or where specific and credible information has been received from a victim
or knowledgeable third party. Various state laws may also require reporting to law enforcement or to a
designated child protection agency.
306.2 Filing a knowingly false allegation of sexual misconduct is prohibited and may violate state
criminal law and civil defamation laws. Any person making a knowingly false allegation of sexual
misconduct shall be subject to disciplinary action by USA Swimming.
306.3 Neither civil nor criminal statutes of limitation apply to reports of cases of sexual abuse.
ARTICLE 307
PROHIBITIONS AGAINST RETALIATION
FOR GOOD FAITH REPORTING OF ABUSE
307.1 No Member shall retaliate against any individual who has made a good faith report under
306.1 or 304.3.18.
307.2 For the purposes of 307.1, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that any adverse
action regarding the employment, membership, or other material rights of an individual who has
made a good faith report under 306.1 or 304.3.18 within 90 days of a report is retaliatory. An
adverse action includes, without limitation: discharge or termination; demotion or reduction in
compensation for services; or the removal of or from, or restrictions on, access to facilities, team
activities or team membership privileges.

405.1 FILING COMPLAINTS — All complaints within the exclusive jurisdiction of the National
Board of Review as set out in 403.2.1A through E above shall set forth the allegations and be
filed with the Chief Executive Officer of USA Swimming, who shall promptly perform an initial
inquiry and, as appropriate, initiate an investigation of the matter as set forth below.
405.2 INVESTIGATON OF COMPLAINTS
4
.1 In those matters occurring during the course of an international meet the National Team
Steering Chair or his/her designee shall make the investigation and report.
.2 In those matters occurring during the course of a national or regional event the Program &
Events Committee Chair or designee shall make the investigation and report.
.3 In those matters involving allegations of physical abuse of an athlete by a coach, a commit-
tee of three coaches appointed by the Board Chair of USA Swimming shall make a determi-
nation with such investigative assistance by the Chief Executive Officer or his/her designee
as the committee may request and report as to whether the coach’s conduct is outside the
customary and acceptable bounds of coaching. In the event such matters are referred to
and heard by the U.S. Center for SafeSport, the U.S. Center for SafeSport’s SafeSport Prac-
tices and Procedures for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Movement shall apply.
.4 In all other matters the Chief Executive Officer or his/her designee shall make the investiga-
tion and report.
405.3 DISPOSITION AFTER INVESTIGATION — After the initial investigation has been com-
pleted, the Chief Executive Officer may decide to initiate a complaint in the name of USA Swim-
ming by filing the complaint with the Chair of the National Board of Review and requesting that a
hearing on the complaint be conducted. Any decision of the Chief Executive Officer not to for-
ward a complaint to the National Board of Review shall be reviewed by the Board Chair of USA
Swimming for a final decision. The Chief Executive Officer may also seek an emergency hearing
as set forth in 405.4 below. If the Chief Executive Officer does not decide to initiate a complaint
in the name of USA Swimming, then the Chief Executive Officer may (i) cause further investiga-
tion to be conducted into the alleged violations; (ii) seek to mediate the complaint; or (iii) advise
the complaining party that, while USA Swimming will not initiate a complaint in its own name, the
2019 Rules & Regulations 103

--- Page 106 Text ---
405.3
complaining party may still file his/her complaint directly with the Chair of the National Board of
Review. If the complaining party chooses to go forward with the complaint, the Chair of the
National Board of Review may then decide to either assign the matter for hearing or dismiss the
complaint.
405.4 EMERGENCY HEARING — After the initial investigation has been completed and upon
the request of the Chief Executive Officer in accordance with 405.3 above, the Chair of the
National Board of Review may order an emergency hearing before the National Board of Review
to determine if the member should be suspended pending the outcome of a full hearing before
the National Board of Review. If an emergency hearing is ordered, the National Board of Review
shall conduct the hearing and publish its results within twenty-one (21) days. Until such time as
the National Board of Review makes a decision all proceedings shall be confidential and not sub-
ject to disclosure to anyone other than the parties to the review and witnesses.
ARTICLE 406
ZONE BOARD OF REVIEW HEARINGS AND PROCEDURES
406.1 FILING COMPLAINTS
.1 Commencement of Action — Any request for hearing is begun by the filing of a Petition
submitted to the Chair of the Zone Board of Review (if submitted to the respective LSC
General Chair, a Zone Director or the Zone Secretary, the Petition is not defective, but the
allowable period of time for the Notice shall not commence until the Petition is received by
the Chair of the Zone Board) consisting of a written statement setting forth a description of
the action, inaction or conduct that is believed to have been improper or incorrect, and the
name of the person or group believed to have acted improperly or the circumstances
believed to require answers, explanation or clarification. The Petition shall be accompanied
by any filing fee due under the Required Zone Board of Review Procedures or by an appli-
cation for waiver of the fee.
.2 Review of Petition — The Chair may review, dismiss or suggest modifications to any Peti-
tion to assure that the Petition sets forth a cause of action under these rules. Any dismissal
by the Chair may be reviewed by a Zone Board of Review panel upon request of the
Petitioner(s).
406.2 HEARINGS
.1 Hearings Conducted by Chair or Presiding Officer — Hearings of the Zone Board of
Review shall be conducted by the Chair of the Zone Board of Review or a Presiding Officer
designated by the Chair.
.2 Hearing by Panel — The Zone Board of Review shall conduct hearings before panels of its
members, provided that each panel shall consist of between three (3) and five (5) members,
one of whom shall be an athlete member.

member, must be present at any hearing before the panel. No hearing may be conducted
without the presence of at least twenty percent (20%) athlete members on the hearing
panel.
104 2019 Rules & Regulations

--- Page 107 Text ---
406.2
.4 Permissible Hearing Formats — A hearing before the Zone Board of Review may be con-
ducted through the receipt of the procedural documents and other written statements or a
hearing at which the parties may appear in person or by means of video telephonic confer-
ence call and testimony may be taken and other forms of pertinent information presented in
addition to oral argument by the parties or their counsel, as reasonably determined by the
Chair or Presiding Officer. Where appropriate in the reasonable determination of the Chair
or the Presiding Officer, the hearing may be conducted in part through written means and in
part by testimony and oral argument.
.5 Right to Counsel — The Petitioner(s), the Respondent(s) and any other person participat-
ing in a hearing conducted by the Zone Board of Review shall be entitled to be represented
by counsel of their choice at their own expense.
.6 Rules of Evidence — Judicial rules regarding admissibility of evidence shall not apply to
the Zone Board of Review. Thus, hearsay, letters, affidavits, news media articles and
reports, etc., as well as direct testimony taken from witnesses present at a hearing, are all
admissible to the extent the Presiding Officer is satisfied as to the relevance and non-repeti-
tive nature of the evidence. To be relevant, such evidence need only tend to assist resolu-
tion of a fact in issue in the hearing. The Zone Board of Review should not hear evidence
protected by the attorney-client privilege or by a Constitutional claim against self-incrimina-
tion. Other claims of privilege, however, should not generally be entertained except in
extraordinary circumstances. Proper weight shall be given to each type of evidence consid-
4
ering the source and other common sense factors.
.7 Open/Closed Hearings — Any hearing, or a part thereof, shall be open to members of the
Zone Board of Review hearing panel, the Presiding Officer, any attorney advising the Pre-
siding Officer, the Petitioner(s), the Respondent(s), any other real party in interest, their
counsel and any witnesses at the request of any of the parties, but shall otherwise be
closed to the public. The Chair may, however, at the request of a party, sequester wit-
nesses. The Zone Board of Review may in its discretion direct the participants to keep the
proceedings and the decision confidential and all or parts of the record of the hearing to be
kept confidential by the respective LSC, Zone and USA Swimming.
.8 Accelerated Hearing Schedule — Except for emergency hearings, covered in 406.3.2, the
Chair, or the Presiding Officer for the hearing, may order, with the agreement of all parties,
an accelerated hearing schedule in the interest of justice and the sport of swimming.
406.3 HEARING PROCEDURES — The procedures to be followed in connection with all hear-
ings of the Zone Board of Review shall be as follows:
.1 Formal Hearing
A Notice of Hearing — Each Respondent(s) shall be given a written Notice of Hearing in
accordance with the form prescribed by the National Board of Review Committee, as
amended from time to time by the Chair of the National Board of Review. The Notice of
Hearing shall be sent to each Respondent's last known address by reputable overnight
delivery service. If the Respondent(s) is the Zone or an officer, Board Member, commit-
tee or sub-committee chair or coordinator, or an official, the Notice of Hearing shall be
also given to the Zone Directors and the Zone Secretary at the Zone’s office, if any.
The Notice of Hearing shall be given as soon as practical following the conclusion of
any preliminary investigation made by or on behalf of the Zone Board of Review, but in
no event later than twenty (20) days after the receipt of the Petition by the Chair.
2019 Rules & Regulations 105

--- Page 108 Text ---
406.3
The form of Notice of Hearing shall include:
(1) a statement in reasonable detail of the charges against each Respondent, or of
the circumstances that are believed to require answers, explanation or clarifica-
tion. A copy of the Petition, if any, received by the Zone Board of Review shall be
attached to the Notice of Hearing;
(2) a statement that the Respondent(s) has the right to have counsel of his/her own
choice to represent him/her, at his/her own expense, at any hearing;
(3) a description of the type of hearing to be held. In the case of an in-person hear-
ing, the Notice of Hearing shall request each Respondent to appear before the
Zone Board of Review with counsel and witnesses, if any;
(4) a date, time and location at which the hearing will be held. The date of the hear-
ing shall be not less than thirty (30) days nor more than sixty (60) days after the
date of transmission of the Notice;
(5) a request that each Respondent answer in writing all of the charges set forth in
the Notice of Hearing. The Notice of Hearing shall state that this Response is to
be delivered at least fourteen (14) days prior to the date of the hearing, to the
Presiding Officer designated in the Notice, at the specified address, with a copy
to the Petitioner(s) and its/their counsel, if any, and anyone else specified in the
Notice of Hearing at the addresses designated; and
(6) a statement of the right of appeal in the event the decision is rendered against
the Respondent(s).
B Response by Respondent(s) — Each Respondent's Response to the Notice and Peti-
tion shall be in writing and delivered to the Presiding Officer designated in the Notice of
Hearing, at least fourteen (14) days prior to the date of the hearing, with a copy deliv-
ered to the Petitioner(s) and his/her counsel and anyone else specified in the Notice of
Hearing at the addresses designated in the Notice.
C Reply by Petitioner(s) — The Petitioner(s) may, but is not required to, offer a rebuttal
to each Respondent's Response. Any rebuttal shall be in writing and delivered to the
Presiding Officer designated in the Notice of Hearing, at least seven (7) days prior to
the date of the hearing, with copies to each Respondent and his/her counsel and to
anyone else specified in the Notice of Hearing at the addresses designated in the
Notice.
D Conduct of Hearing
(1) Generally. Hearings shall be conducted fairly and in an orderly fashion, but with-
out regard for the formalities of traditional courtroom procedures. The Presiding
Officer is responsible for keeping the parties and their counsel, if any, focused on
the issues at hand and the necessary elements of proof and for enforcing the rule
that no one may speak who has not been recognized by the Presiding Officer.
For hearings conducted other than entirely through the receipt of written state-
ments, the Zone Board of Review shall cause a credible recording or transcription
to be made of the hearing. No record of the deliberations of the Zone Board of
Review need be kept and, if kept, shall not be available to anyone other than the
members of the Zone Board of Review, the Presiding Officer and counsel to the
Zone Board of Review.
106 2019 Rules & Regulations

--- Page 109 Text ---
406.3
(2) Absence of a Party. The hearing may proceed in the absence of any party who
fails to be available at the appointed time and the hearing may proceed to judg-
ment despite that person's absence. If the Presiding Officer determines that in the
interests of justice and the sport of swimming the hearing cannot proceed without
the absent party, the Presiding Officer may adjourn the hearing and reschedule it
for such time as the absent party can be present. Any subsequent absence may
be taken into account by the Zone Board of Review in reaching its decision.
(3) Sequence. The hearing shall be opened by the recording of the place, time and
date of the hearing and the presence of the members of the Zone Board of
Review, the parties, counsel, if any, and any other witnesses or observers. Each
party (Petitioner(s) first, Respondent(s) second) may then present a brief opening
statement setting forth the party's view of the issues in dispute, the relief sought
and what they hope to prove by the presentation of evidence. The Petitioner's
claims, evidence and witnesses shall be presented. The Respondent(s)'s
defenses, claims, evidence and witnesses shall then be presented. In the discre-
tion of the Presiding Officer, the Petitioner(s) may then be allowed to rebut any
testimony or evidence presented by the Respondent(s) after the Respondent(s)'s
initial presentation. In the discretion of the Presiding Officer, the Respondent(s)
may be permitted to rebut any testimony or evidence presented by the
Petitioner(s) during the Petitioner's rebuttal presentation. Finally, each party (in
the same order) shall be entitled to make a brief summation of that party's case. 4
(4) Rules of Evidence; Witnesses' Testimony. The rules of evidence governing the
hearing are set forth in 406.2.6 above. Each witness may present testimony ini-
tially either in the form of questions and answers between the witness and coun-
sel or in uninterrupted narrative. The Presiding Officer and the members of the
Zone Board of Review may question any person at any time during the hearing.
Thus, for example, in an exercise of discretion, the Presiding Officer could call a
witness who has not yet been called or whom no party intended to call and pro-
pound questions to, or elicit narrative testimony from, that witness. Witnesses
shall be subject to cross examination by the other party and to questioning by the
Presiding Officer and members of the Zone Board of Review. All parties will be
expected to be available for questioning by the Zone Board of Review, whether or
not they may have given other testimony at the hearing.
(5) Oath. All witnesses shall be sworn using an oath substantially as follows: “I swear
or affirm that the evidence I provide shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing
but the truth.” A material violation of this oath may be considered a violation of
304.3.16 of the Code of Conduct as “dishonesty in connection with any USA
Swimming-related activity.”
(6) Variance of Procedures. The Presiding Officer shall have wide discretion to vary
these procedures in the interests of justice, the sport of swimming and efficiency,
but in doing so shall afford all parties a full and substantially equal opportunity to
present any material or relevant evidence. A hearing may be adjourned by the Pre-
siding Officer at the request of a party or on the Presiding Officer's initiative where
an adjournment will serve the interests of fairness, justice and the sport of swim-
ming. If a hearing is adjourned, the continuance shall be scheduled for any early
date of mutual convenience, but in the discretion of the Presiding Officer. Justice
2019 Rules & Regulations 107

--- Page 110 Text ---
406.3
and the sport of swimming ordinarily will be best served by an expeditious resump-
tion and conclusion to the hearing.
E Decision of Zone Board of Review — The decision of the Zone Board of Review may
be rendered at the time of the hearing and, if not so rendered, as soon as possible
thereafter and in no event more than fourteen (14) days after the conclusion of the
hearing. The decision shall include findings of facts and a statement of remedies
ordered or penalties imposed, if any, and a statement setting forth the rights of the par-
ties to appeal the decision. The decision shall be in writing, or in case of a decision ren-
dered at the hearing, reduced to writing promptly, and delivered to the Petitioner(s),
Respondent(s), their respective counsel, any other party to the proceeding, and the
General Chair and the Secretary of the respective LSC(s) and the Chief Executive Offi-
cer of USA Swimming.
.2 Emergency Hearing
A Reasons for Emergency Hearing — When compliance with the formal hearing proce-
dures would be likely not to produce a sufficiently early decision to provide justice to
the affected parties or to be in the best interest of the sport of swimming, the Zone
Board of Review is authorized to summarily hear and decide any matter relating to a
scheduled competition or other matter of similar urgency.
B Notice of Emergency Hearing — Each Respondent shall be given notice of such an
emergency hearing as time and circumstances may reasonably dictate. The notice may
be oral or in writing, and shall substantially comply with the notice requirements set
forth in these rules as the emergent nature of the issue permits.
C Conduct of Emergency Hearing — The hearing may be conducted at any location
likely to contribute to expeditious resolution of the Petition, including the site of a swim-
ming competition, but in any event under such circumstances so as to fairly protect the
right of procedural due process of the Respondent(s) and confidentiality of the process.
All or some of the participants in the hearing may participate by telephone conference
equipment. If at least three (3) members of the Zone Board of Review are not available
due to time constraints, the Chair of the Zone Board of Review, or designee, is autho-
rized to appoint one or more Individual Members to serve on the Zone Board of Review
solely for the purpose of conducting this emergency hearing. The hearing shall substan-
tially comply with the hearing procedures set forth above insofar as the emergent nature
of the hearing permits. No hearing may be conducted without the presence of an athlete
member.
D Decision of Zone Board of Review — The decision of the Zone Board of Review shall
be rendered at the time of the hearing or as soon as possible thereafter in keeping with
the emergency circumstances. The decision shall include findings of facts and a state-
ment of remedies ordered, if any, and a statement of the right to request a subsequent for-
mal hearing. The decision shall be in writing, or in case of a decision rendered orally at the
hearing, reduced to writing within fourteen (14) days thereafter and delivered to the
Petitioner(s), the Respondent(s), their counsel, any other real party in interest to the pro-
ceeding, the Chair of the Zone Board of Review, and the General Chair and the Secretary
of the respective LSC, the Secretary of the Zone and the Chief Executive Officer of USA
Swimming.
E Right to a Subsequent Formal Hearing — If either the Petitioner(s) or the
Respondent(s) shall deliver to the Chair of the Zone Board of Review a written request
108 2019 Rules & Regulations

--- Page 111 Text ---
406.3
for a further hearing within fourteen (14) days of the date of receipt of the written deci-
sion resulting from the emergency hearing, a formal hearing shall be held as a new
proceeding in accordance with this section, as though the emergency hearing had not
taken place. Failure to make this request in a timely manner shall preclude the
aggrieved party from making any further appeal.
.3 Stay of Decision Pending Appeal — The Zone Board of Review shall have the authority
and discretion, but not the duty, to stay its decision, in whole or in part, subject to specified
conditions, during the time allowed to demand a further hearing after an emergency hearing,
or to appeal to the National Board of Review, with the decision going into effect automati-
cally if those conditions occur or if no demand or appeal is filed during the allowable period
or at such time as a perfected appeal is terminated without the decision being modified by
the appellate authority.
.4 Extensions of Time — The time within which the Notice of Hearing must be transmitted
may not be extended without the consent of the Petitioner(s) or the USA Swimming General
Counsel.
.5 Method of Delivery — The delivery of all Notices of Hearing to Respondent(s) and all final
Decisions to the non-prevailing party(ies) shall be by overnight express delivery. Delivery of
all other pleadings, orders and communications may be by electronic mail or other means,
as directed by the Chair of the Zone Board of Review.
.6 Severability — Nothing in these Rules is intended to override applicable state corporation 4
law. In the event the corporation laws of the state of incorporation of a Respondent’s LSC
(or if there are more than one Respondent and not all reside within one LSC, the state of
incorporation of the LSC where the majority in number of Respondents reside) specifically
prohibit conduct herein required, the Zone may so notify the Chair of the Rules and Regula-
tions Committee and may request a waiver, review or modification of any rule or provision
herein. In the event that any provision of these Rules is rendered impermissible or illegal by
a court of competent jurisdiction, that provision and all remaining provisions shall, where
possible, remain in full force and effect in all locations outside the subject matter jurisdiction
of the court rendering such opinion.

APPEAL FROM NATIONAL BOARD OF REVIEW TO BOARD OF DIRECTORS
409.1 PROCEDURE
.1 Any real party in interest, including any officer of USA Swimming or the Chief Executive Offi-
cer, may appeal any decision of the National Board of Review as follows:
A Matters heard by the National Board of Review pursuant to its original jurisdiction,
heard de novo or heard pursuant to its discretionary jurisdiction, may be appealed to
the Board of Directors within thirty (30) days of the date of the issuing of its written
decision.
B Matters heard by the National Board of Review on appeal from a Zone Board of
Review, other than any matter included in 409.1.1A, shall be heard only upon the grant-
ing of a petition from a real party in interest. Unless a majority of the Board Chair, Gen-
eral Counsel and the Athlete’s Vice Chair (or their respective designees) shall
determine, based upon the record below, that an appeal shall have sufficient merit and
be of such general application as to justify an appeal to the Board of Directors, the peti-
tion shall be denied and the matter shall be final, with no further appeal allowed.
.2 The Petition on appeal is to be served upon the Chief Executive Officer, as well as the other
party(ies) to the National Board of Review proceeding, and shall be accompanied by a $250

hearing. The General Counsel may establish a hearing panel consisting of at least five (5)
members (all of whom must be members of the Board of Directors and at least twenty per-
cent (20%) of whom must be athlete members) to hear any appeal, including appeals con-
ducted as de novo hearings. The decision of the hearing panel shall be final with the same
force and effect as if the full Board of Directors heard the matter.
.5 USA Swimming Board of Directors may assess fees and costs against the losing party.

OF REVIEW AND APPELLATE BODIES
412.1 STANDARDS OF CONDUCT — Members (the “Review Members”) of Zone and
National Board of Review panels and the Board of Directors appeals panels (collectively, the
“Review Board”) shall:
.1 Uphold the integrity and independence of the respective Review Board;
.2 Avoid any impropriety or the appearance of impropriety in connection with service as a
Review Member and swimming-related activities generally; and
.3 Perform the duties of a Review Member impartially and diligently.
412.2 GROUNDS FOR RECUSAL — Review Members shall recuse themselves from partici-
pating in any matter pending before their respective Review Board:
.1 In which their impartiality might reasonably be questioned;
.2 Where they have a personal bias or prejudice concerning a party in the pending matter or
have personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the pending matter (other
than knowledge obtained as a Review Member or known generally to a substantial portion
of the membership of the respective LSC, the Zone or USA Swimming);
.3 Where they or a member of their family are a party or are likely to be a material witness in
the pending matter;
.4 Where they or a member of their family have an interest that could be substantially affected
by the outcome of the proceeding; or
.5 Where they or a member of their family have served or are serving as counsel in the pend-
ing matter or are members of a law firm that served or is serving as counsel in the pending
matter.
412.3 RECUSAL BY MEMBER — Review Members shall recuse themselves as soon as they
become aware of facts that give rise to the duty to do so by giving notice to the Zone Board of
Review Chair, the National Board of Review Chair, or in the case of the Chair of the National Board
of Review or Board of Directors appeal panel members, to the General Counsel, as applicable.
412.4 RECUSAL/DISQUALIFICATION REQUESTED BY PARTY — By written notice to the
Chair of the respective Review Board or to the General Counsel, in the case of Board of Direc-
tors appeal panel members (respectively, the “Review Board Chair”), any party may request that
a Review Member recuse himself/herself or be disqualified from serving on the pending matter
stating the reasons for recusal or disqualification with specificity. Such notice shall be given at
least fourteen (14) days prior to the scheduled date of the hearing on such matter or, if the party
sustains the burden of proving good cause for the lateness of the notice, as soon as reasonably
possible after discovery of the reason for the need for recusal. The named Review Member shall
reach a decision on the matter and notify the Review Board Chair of that decision within seven
(7) days of receipt of the party's notice. If the member's decision is not in favor of recusal, then
the Review Board Chair may, if appropriate, disqualify the member from participating in the pend-
ing matter. If there is no disqualification, the hearing shall be conducted as scheduled and,
unless it is a hearing before the Board of Directors, the party giving the notice may appeal the

REQUIRED ZONE BOARD OF REVIEW PROCEDURES
413.1 INTRODUCTION — USA Swimming requires each Zone to establish a Zone Board of
Review to hear complaints, protests and appeals regarding the administration and conduct
(including acts and failures to act) of the sport of swimming in the Zone, conduct that may violate
the USA Swimming Code of Conduct or otherwise violate the policies, procedures, rules and reg-
ulations adopted by USA Swimming or the Zone, or conduct that may bring USA Swimming, the
Zone, the respective LSC or the sport of swimming into disrepute. These procedures are
intended to provide a uniform method of appeal from any decision, act or failure to act to which a
member of the Zone or, where the conduct occurred in the Zone, another Zone (or LSC within
another Zone) takes exception, and to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing before a group of
independent and impartial people.
413.2 BOARD OF REVIEW ORGANIZATION
4
.1 Establishment — The Zone Board of Review shall be independent and impartial.
.2 Members — The Zone Board of Review shall have at least twenty-five (25) regular mem-
bers comprised of at least (2) members from each LSC within the Zone. The Zone Board of
Review, and any panel hearing a case, shall have a sufficient number of athlete members to
constitute at least twenty percent (20%) of its membership. The Zone may increase the
number of Zone Board of Review members by resolution but may only decrease the number
of members upon the expiration of the term of office of any incumbent members. No hearing
shall proceed without the required athlete representation.

a meeting or hearing.

successor.
.9 Incapacities and Vacancies — Determination of Vacancy or Incapacity
A Office of Chair — In the event of a vacancy in the office of the Chair, or of the Chair's
temporary or permanent incapacity, the Vice Chair shall become the Acting Chair until
an election can be held at a meeting of the Zone Board of Review to fill the remaining

incapacity. If the Chair is going to be absent from the Zone, the Chair may, but is not
obligated to, designate the Vice Chair as Acting Chair for the duration of the absence.
B Presiding Officer — In the event of the death, resignation or permanent incapacity of
a Presiding Officer, the Chair shall appoint another member of the Zone Board of
Review or an attorney to serve until the completion of the hearings assigned to that

ests of fairness, justice and the sport of swimming. In the case of a temporary incapac-
ity of a Presiding Officer, the Chair shall have discretion regarding appointment of a

lected at the time a Petition or Request for Formal Hearing following an Emergency Hearing
is filed with the Zone Board of Review. If, on its own initiative or upon written request, the

front of the platform or the deck (prior to “take your mark”). On the com-
mand, “Take your mark,” the swimmer shall immediately assume the
starting position that maintains at least one foot at the front of the plat-
form or the deck.
In-the-Water Starts A swimmer starting in the water must have one hand on the wall or
starting platform and one foot on the wall and may face any direction.
The backstroke start may be used as the in-the-water start during free-
style events and for freestyle relays, but not for the freestyle leg of med-
ley relay events. A backstroke starting ledge may be used in freestyle
events.
Racing Starts USMS has no requirement for certification of racing starts in order to
use starting platforms or backstroke starting ledges.
Butterfly The breaststroke kick may be used exclusively or interchangeably with
the dolphin kick while doing the butterfly stroke at any time during the
race. Only one breaststroke kick is permitted per arm pull, except that a
single breaststroke kick is permitted prior to the turn and the finish with-
out an arm pull. After the start and after each turn, a single breaststroke
kick is permitted prior to the first arm pull.
Relays • Mixed relays shall consist of two male and two female swimmers who
may swim in any order.
• Relay swimmers who cannot exit the water quickly enough to prevent
interference with automatic officiating equipment may hold on to the
lane line until all relays have finished, allowing them to exit the pool
more slowly or via the ladders at the conclusion of the race.
• In relay races involving in-the-water starts, a relay will be disqualified
if the feet of the outgoing swimmer lose touch with the end of the M
course before the preceding teammate touches the wall. Inadvertent

loss of contact is not grounds for disqualification if the outgoing swim-
mer corrects the foot position prior to the incoming swimmer touching
the end of the course.
• The relay team shall be disqualified even if the swimmer in default
returns to the original starting point at the wall after the preceding
teammate has touched the wall.
Age Determining For short course meters and long course meters meets, the swimmer’s
Date age is determined as of December 31 of the year of competition.

the other end of the pool at the end of each heat and a warm-up/
warm-down period must be offered at least once during each half
hour of competition.
• A swimmer who completes a race may warm down in the assigned
lane while the rest of the swimmers complete the heat and shall not
be disqualified if such action does not delay the start of the next event.
• If the meet is a dual-sanctioned meet with USA Swimming, the
requirements for continuous warm-up may be adjusted depending on
availability of warm-up space at the venue by agreement between the
LMSC and LSC host clubs.
• Once the entry information is published, changes which further
restrict the availability of continuous warm-up/warm-down space are
not permitted.
Gender USMS policy guidelines govern eligibility of athletes to compete in the
male and female gender categories. Protests of eligibility shall be
referred to the USMS Rules Committee chair. Athletes shall be permit-
ted to compete in the gender that corresponds to their USMS registra-
tion pending resolution of any protest.
Scratch Procedures There is no penalty for failure to report for or compete in an event,
except that a swimmer may not be permitted to swim if the swimmer
does not comply with check-in procedures listed in the meet announce-
ment. There are no “declared false starts” in USMS sanctioned or recog-
nized meets.
Dual-Sanctioned If a USMS-sanctioned meet is held in conjunction with a USA Swim-

COMBINED, PARALLEL,
AND INTERWOVEN MEETS
(DUAL-SANCTION EVENTS)
The number of inquiries as to what mechanisms are available for combining USA Swimming and
USMS swimming meets has been increasing. The reasons for combining these meets are many,
ranging from the limited availability of pool time and officials to the desire to promote the sport as
a lifelong activity. There are several ways of accomplishing this goal within the rules and
insurance policies of each organization. This document outlines these options.
It is assumed that all competitors are a member of USA Swimming, USMS, or both. Those that
are members of both must select one organization with which to compete for the entire meet.
Dual membership cannot be used to exceed the daily event limits imposed by either
organization. Automatic recognition of times achieved by a USMS swimmer competing in the
USA-S portion is still available.
Any of the joint meets described below must have sanctions from both USA Swimming and
USMS. Both sanctions must be held by the host organization. The host organization cannot be
required to accept a participant from either USMS or USA Swimming that would otherwise be
barred from participation by their respective organizations.
USMS Record and Top Ten submissions must comply with all USMS documentation
requirements.
Combined Meets
With the consent of all (co-)hosting teams and the LSC and LMSC, a combined meet may be
sanctioned by both USA Swimming and USMS and all swimmers competing according to USA
Swimming rules. This mechanism allows the meet host(s) to seed the event as they normally
would, based upon times, with USA Swimming and USMS members combined in heats without
specific lanes allocated to one organization or the other. Relay teams must consist of members
of the same organization
Parallel Meets
The two meets may be swum in parallel by assigning some number of lanes to USMS
competitors and a different set to USA Swimming competitors. If possible, separate stroke and
turn officials for each set is preferred. It is permissible to adjust, for example, the makeup of the
USMS heats so that competitors in a given heat have approximately the same seed times. Each
organization's rules would apply to their members.
Interwoven Meets
The two meets may be swum with complete heats of swimmers from both organizations
alternating. There would be no need for separate stroke and turn officials. Each organization's
rules would apply to their members.

or fails to demand in writing that action not be taken without a meeting. The Notice shall state the
action to be taken, the time by which a Director must respond, that failure to respond by the time

been waived unless the Corporation receives such demand from the Director in writing by the
time stated in the Notice and such demand has not been revoked. Any Director who in writing
has voted, abstained, or demanded action not be taken without a meeting pursuant to 4.9 may
revoke such abstention, or demand in writing received by the Corporation by the time stated in
the Notice. All communications under 4.9 may be transmitted or received by the Corporation by

SAFESPORT CODE FOR THE U.S. OLYMPIC AND
PARALYMPIC MOVEMENT
Effective March 3, 2017
The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Movement is committed to creating and maintaining a sport
community where all persons who participate in sport programs and activities can work and learn
together in an atmosphere free of all forms of emotional, physical and sexual misconduct. The
U.S. Center for SafeSport's Response and Resolution Office (Office) has issued this SafeSport
Code for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Movement (Code) and its appendices (collectively,
Code) pursuant to the Center's authority under the United States Olympic Committee's (USOC)
Bylaws.
Individuals within the Office's jurisdiction are responsible for knowing the information, policies
and procedures outlined in this Code and its related policies. The Office reserves the right to
make changes to this document as necessary. Once posted online, changes are effective imme-
diately unless otherwise noted.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Application
The Code applies to Covered Individuals, as defined below.
B. Online, email, cellular or other electronic media or digital conduct
The Code may be applied to behavior conducted online or distributed electronically using
email, text messages or any other electronic medium. This includes without limitation
blogs, web postings, chats and social networking sites.
C. Age and competitive level irrelevant
Except as specifically noted, the Code applies without respect to age or competitive
level.
D. Other remedies
1. The Code does not replace:
a. the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act;
b. the employment practices of any relevant organization; or
c. applicable federal or state law.
2. T he Code does not extend or restrict a person's right to file charges or claims with
any other agency, law enforcement or court. Individuals are encouraged to ensure
their rights have not expired through these other avenues.
II. DEFINITIONS
The following terms, as used in the Code and Appendices A and B, shall have the following
meaning:
A. Athlete
An individual recognized as an athlete by an NGB under its bylaws, rules, regulations,
guidelines or other governing documents.
1

--- Page 179 Text ---
B. Bullying Behavior
Repeated and/or severe (a) aggressive behavior (b) among Minors,1 (c) that is intended
or likely to hurt, control or diminish another person emotionally, physically or sexually.
1. Forms
a. Physical
Hitting, pushing, punching, beating, biting, striking, kicking, choking, spitting or
slapping; throwing objects such as sporting equipment at another person.
b. Verbal
Teasing, ridiculing, taunting, name-calling or intimidating or threatening to cause
someone harm.
c. Social, including cyberbullying
Using rumors or false statements about someone to diminish that person's repu-
tation; using electronic communications, social media or other technology to
harass, frighten, intimidate or humiliate someone; socially excluding someone
and asking others to do the same.
d. Sexual
Teasing, ridiculing or taunting based on gender or sexual orientation (real or
implied), gender traits or behavior (e.g., taunting someone for being too effemi-
nate), or teasing someone about their looks or behavior as it relates to sexual
attractiveness.
2. Rude, mean and conflict—distinguished
Conduct may not rise to the level of Bullying Behavior if it is rude (inadvertently say-
ing or doing something hurtful), mean (purposefully saying or doing something hurt-
ful, but not as part of a pattern of behavior), or arising from conflict or struggle
between persons, absent a Power Imbalance, who perceive they have incompatible
goals.
3. Criminal conduct
Bullying Behavior includes any conduct described as bullying under federal or state
law.
C. Consent
Freely given agreement by all people involved. As it relates to Sexual Conduct, Consent
requires words or actions by a person who is legally and functionally competent to give
informed permission for specific sexual activity. Consent to any one form of sexual activ-
ity does not automatically imply Consent for any other forms of sexual activity. Previous
relationships or prior consent does not imply consent to future sexual activity. Once
given, Consent can be withdrawn through clear communication.
Consent does not exist if a person does not give Consent, or an Inability to Consent or
Inability to Refuse exists.
1 Bullying-like behaviors among adults are addressed under other forms of misconduct such as Hazing and Harassment.
2

--- Page 180 Text ---
1. Inability to Consent
An Inability to Consent exists when Consent cannot be given because the person (a)
lacks legal capacity or (b) is Incapacitated.
a. Incapacitated
A state where a person cannot make a rational, reasonable decision because
they lack the capacity to give informed consent (i.e., to understand the "who,
what, when, where, why or how" of the sexual interaction).
A person may be Incapacitated because of a developmental or mental disability,
illness, injury, alcohol or other drug use (voluntary or involuntary), blackout, sleep,
unconsciousness or involuntary physical restraint.
2. Inability to Refuse
An Inability to Refuse exists when effective Consent cannot be given because of the
use of Coercion, Force, Intimidation, or creating or misusing a Power Imbalance.
a. Coercion
Unreasonable pressure to engage in Sexual Conduct. Whether pressure is unrea-
sonable depends on four factors, considered together: (a) frequency, (b) intensity,
(c) isolation and (d) duration.
b. Force
The use or threat of physical force that overcomes free will or resistance.
c. Intimidation
Implied threats or acts that reasonably cause a fear of harm in another.
D. Covered Adult
A Covered Individual who is 18 years of age or older.
E. Covered Individual
Any individual who: (a) currently is, or was at the time of a possible violation of the Code,
within the governance or disciplinary jurisdiction of an NGB or who is seeking to be
within the governance or disciplinary jurisdiction of an NGB (e.g., through application for
membership), (b) is an Athlete or Non-athlete Participant that an NGB or the USOC for-
mally authorizes, approves or appoints to a position of authority over Athletes or to have
frequent contact with Athletes or (c) an NGB identifies as being within the Office's juris-
diction.
F. Covered Minor
A Covered Individual who is under the age of 18.
G. Criminal Disposition
Any disposition of a criminal proceeding, other than an adjudication of not guilty, includ-
ing an adjudication of guilt or admission to a criminal violation; a plea to a lesser included
offense; a plea of no contest; or the disposition of the proceeding through a diversionary
program, deferred adjudication, disposition of supervision, conditional dismissal, or simi-
lar arrangement.
3

--- Page 181 Text ---
H. Emotional Misconduct
Repeated and/or severe non-contact behavior involving (a) Verbal Acts, (b) Physical Acts
and/or (c) Acts that Deny Attention or Support. Emotional Misconduct is determined by
the objective behaviors, not whether harm is intended or results from the behavior.
1. Verbal Acts
Verbal assault that repeatedly attacks someone personally (e.g., calling a person
worthless, fat or disgusting; taunting a person for being too effeminate); repeatedly
and excessively yelling at a particular athlete or other participant in a manner that
serves no productive training or motivational purpose.
2. Physical Acts
Physically aggressive behaviors, such as throwing sport equipment, water bottles or
chairs at or in the presence of others; punching walls, windows or other objects.
3. Acts that Deny Attention or Support
Ignoring or isolating a person for extended periods of time, including routinely or arbi-
trarily excluding a participant from practice.
4. Exclusions
Emotional Misconduct does not include professionally accepted and age-appropriate
coaching methods for skill and performance enhancement, physical conditioning,
team building or appropriate discipline.
5. Criminal conduct
Emotional Misconduct includes any act or conduct (e.g., psychological abuse, emo-
tional abuse, mental abuse, child abuse) that can be described as emotional abuse
under applicable federal or state law.
I. Harassment
Repeated and/or severe conduct that (a) causes fear, humiliation or annoyance, (b) offends
or degrades, (c) creates a hostile environment, or (d) reflects discriminatory bias in an
attempt to establish dominance, superiority or power over an individual athlete or group
based on age, gender, sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity, race, ethnicity,
culture, religion, national origin, or mental or physical disability; or (e) any act or conduct
described as harassment under federal or state law. Whether conduct is harassing depends
on the totality of the circumstances, including the nature, frequency, intensity, location, con-
text and duration of the behavior.
1. Forms
Harassment, which may be a form of Emotional, Physical or Sexual Misconduct,
includes but is not limited to:
a. Discriminatory Harassment
Conduct with the design or effect of establishing dominance, superiority or power
over an individual or group based on age, sex, race, color, ethnicity, culture,
national origin, religion, sexual orientation, gender expression, gender identity, or
mental or physical disability.
4

--- Page 182 Text ---
b. Stalking
Conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to
fear for his or her safety or the safety of others, or to suffer substantial emotional
distress. Stalking generally involves a course of conduct which includes two or
more acts, involving persistent and frequent unwanted in-person contact, surveil-
lance or unwanted telephone and/or other electronic contact.
i. Examples
Stalking behaviors include without limitation: following a person; appearing at
a person's home, class, work or practice; frequent phone calls, emails, or text
messages; continuing to contact a person after receiving requests to stop;
leaving unwanted written messages, objects or gifts; vandalizing a person's
property; threatening, intimidating or intrusive behavior; and violating a lawful
order preventing contact with a person.
c. Sexual Harassment
Conduct by a Covered Adult toward an Athlete or other non-employee, Non-ath-
lete Participant that includes (a) sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or
other verbal or physical behaviors of a sexual nature; or (b) is sufficiently severe,
persistent or pervasive and objectively offensive that it negatively affects an indi-
vidual's performance.
J. Hazing
Any conduct that subjects another person, whether physically, mentally, emotionally or
psychologically, to anything that may endanger, abuse, humiliate, degrade or intimidate
the person as a condition of joining or being socially accepted by a group, team or orga-
nization. Purported Consent by the person subject to Hazing is not a defense, regardless
of the person's perceived willingness to cooperate or participate.
1. Examples
Examples of Hazing include:
a. Contact acts
Tying, taping or otherwise physically restraining another person; beating, paddling
or other forms of physical assault.
b. Non-contact acts
Requiring or forcing the consumption of alcohol, illegal drugs or other substances in
an effort to elicit a negative physiological response, including participation in binge
drinking and drinking games; personal servitude; requiring social actions (e.g., wear-
ing inappropriate or provocative clothing) or public displays (e.g., public nudity) that
are illegal or meant to draw ridicule; excessive training requirements demanded of
only particular individuals on a team that serve no reasonable or productive training
purpose; sleep deprivation; otherwise unnecessary schedule disruptions; withholding
of water and/or food; restrictions on personal hygiene.
c. Sexualized acts
Actual or simulated Sexual Conduct of any nature.
5

--- Page 183 Text ---
2. Criminal acts
Any act or conduct that constitutes hazing under applicable federal or state law.
K. Intimate Relationship

ship. Whether a relationship is intimate is based on the totality of the circumstances,
including: regular contact and/or interactions outside of or unrelated to the sport relation-
ship (electronically or in person), the parties' emotional connectedness, the exchange of
gifts, ongoing physical contact and/or Sexual Conduct, identity as a couple, the sharing
of sensitive personal information, and/or knowledge about each other's lives outside the
sport relationship.
L. Local Affiliated Organization (LAO)
A regional, state or local club or organization that is directly affiliated with an NGB, such
as a regional affiliate or a local club, or that is affiliated with an NGB by virtue of its direct
affiliation with a regional affiliate or organization.

Paralympic Sport Organization recognized by the United States Olympic Committee
pursuant to the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act, 36 U.S.C. §§ 220501-
220529. When the USOC manages and governs a Paralympic sport, the USOC falls
within this definition.
O. Non-athlete Participant
Any coach, trainer, team staff, medical or paramedical personnel, administrator, official,
or other athlete support personnel, employee or volunteer who participates.
P. Physical Misconduct

ting another with objects, such as sporting equipment; encouraging or knowingly
permitting an Athlete to return to play prematurely following a serious injury (e.g.,
a concussion) and without the clearance of a medical professional.

viding illegal drugs or non-prescribed medications to another.
2. Criminal conduct

conduct under federal or state law (e.g. child abuse, child neglect, assault).
3. Exclusion
Physical misconduct does not include professionally accepted coaching methods of
skill enhancement, physical conditioning, team building, appropriate discipline or
improved athlete performance. For example, hitting, punching and kicking are well-
regulated forms of contact in combat sports but have no place in swimming.
Q. Position of Power

R. Power Imbalance
A Power Imbalance may exist:
1. W here one person is in a Position of Power such that, based on the totality of the cir-
cumstances, there is a Power Imbalance.
a. Whether someone occupies a Position of Power such that there is a Power Imbal-
ance depends on several factors, including: the nature and extent of the supervi-
sory, evaluative or other authority over the person; the actual relationship
between the parties; the parties' respective roles; the nature and duration of the
relationship; the age of the adult; the age of the people involved.
b. Once a coach-Athlete relationship is established, a Power Imbalance is presumed
to exist throughout the coach-Athlete relationship (regardless of age) and is pre-
sumed to continue for Minor Athletes after the coach-Athlete relationship termi-
nates and the Athlete reaches 20 years of age. A Power Imbalance may exist, but
is not presumed, where an Intimate Relationship existed before the sport relation-
ship (e.g., a relationship between two spouses or life partners that preceded the
sport relationship).
2. B ased on the totality of the circumstances, including whether there is an aggressor,
and/or a significant disparity in age, size, strength or mental capacity.

--- Page 186 Text ---
III. PROHIBITED CONDUCT
A. Sexual misconduct
1. Generally
Sexual misconduct offenses include:
a. Sexual Conduct (or attempts to commit the same), without Consent.
b. Sexual Conduct (or attempts to commit the same), where there is a Power Imbal-
ance, regardless of purported Consent.
c. Sexual Harassment.
d. An Intimate Relationship involving a person in a Position of Power where a Power
Imbalance exists.
2. Sexual misconduct involving Minors
Regardless of any purported Consent, a sexual misconduct offense involving a Minor
includes:
a. Sexual Conduct (or attempt to commit the same) between a Covered Adult and a
Minor where the age difference is three or more years.
b. Sexual Conduct (or attempt to commit the same) between a Covered Adult and a
Minor where the age difference is less than three years, but a Power Imbalance
exists.
c. An Intimate Relationship (or attempt to establish the same) between a Covered
Adult and a Minor where the age difference is three or more years and a Power
Imbalance exists.
d. Sexual Conduct between a Covered Minor and another Minor if: (1) the age differ-
ence is three or more years, or (2) there is a Power Imbalance based on the total-
ity of the circumstances.
3. Child sexual abuse
A Covered Individual shall not engage in any behavior that constitutes child sexual
abuse as defined by federal or applicable state law.
4. Criminal Disposition
It is a violation of the Code for a Covered Individual to be convicted of or subject to a
Criminal Disposition for a crime involving (a) any form of sexual misconduct or (b) a
Minor.
5. Other
A Covered Individual shall not engage in any other form of sexual misconduct, includ-
ing Bullying Behaviors or Hazing of a sexual nature.
B. Other misconduct
1. Emotional or Physical Misconduct
A Covered Individual shall not engage in Emotional or Physical Misconduct. Emo-
tional or Physical Misconduct may include Bullying Behaviors, Hazing or Harassment.
2. Proactive policies
An LAO, NGB or the USOC may adopt proactive policies that apply to Covered Indi-
viduals and set standards for professional boundaries, minimize the appearance of
9

--- Page 187 Text ---
impropriety and have the effect of preventing boundary violations and prohibiting
grooming tactics.2 Tailored to a specific sport, context, legal structure or constituency,
such policies may address overnight travel rules (e.g., preventing unrelated Covered
Adults and Minors from sharing rooms under specified circumstances), massages
and rubdowns, social media and electronic communications, photography, locker
rooms, one-on-one meetings and gifting. If a Covered Individual violates a proactive
policy established by the Covered Individual's LAO, NGB or the USOC, it shall also
be a violation of the Code.
C. Retaliation
Retaliation is any adverse action taken by a Covered Individual against a person partici-
pating in the Office's proceedings. Retaliation by a Covered Individual against a person
for making an allegation, supporting a Reporting Party or providing information relevant
to an allegation is a serious violation of the Code.3
IV. ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY
A. Exclusive authority—sexual misconduct
The Office has the exclusive authority to investigate and resolve conduct involving (a)
sexual misconduct; and (b) prohibited conduct under the Code that is reasonably related
to the underlying allegation of sexual misconduct. Exclusive authority means (a) only the
Office will investigate and manage any related arbitration involving sexual misconduct;
and (b) neither the NGB nor the USOC will conduct its own investigation or arbitration
with respect to possible sexual misconduct, except as otherwise provided. See Appendi-
ces A and B.
B. Discretionary authority
On the written request of the NGB or USOC, the Office may, in its discretion, accept
authority over alleged violations of any prohibited conduct under the Code.
V. REPORTING
A. Sexual misconduct
1. C onduct by a Covered Individual that could constitute sexual misconduct should be
reported to the Office as set forth in the SafeSport Practices and Procedures for the
U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Movement (Appendix A).
2. I f an allegation involves child abuse or neglect, the matter should also be
referred to the appropriate legal authorities.
2 "Grooming" describes the process whereby a person engages in a series or pattern of behaviors with a goal of engaging in
sexual misconduct. Grooming is initiated when a person seeks out a vulnerable minor. Once selected, offenders will then earn
the minor's trust, and potentially the trust of the minor's family. After the offender has engaged the minor in sexually
inappropriate behavior, the offender seeks to maintain control over him/her. Grooming occurs through direct, in-person and/or
online contact.
3 Because the Office's authority is limited to direct or indirect actions by a Covered Individual, the power to address retaliatory
discrimination or harassment is likewise limited. The Office does not have any control or authority over the conduct of others
outside its jurisdiction and does not have any control or authority over the employment status of Covered Individuals. "
10

--- Page 188 Text ---
B. Other misconduct
1. Emotional and Physical Misconduct
Conduct by a Covered Individual that could constitute Emotional or Physical Miscon-
duct under the Code, including Bullying Behaviors, Hazing and Harassment, should
be reported to the relevant, promulgating organization.
2. Proactive policies
Conduct by a Covered Individual that could violate a proactive policy should be
reported to the relevant, promulgating organization. If the relevant, promulgating
organization is an LAO, the LAO should also report a possible violation of a proactive
policy to its NGB. The NGB, in turn, should report the matter to the Office.
C. Retaliation
1. Sexual misconduct
Retaliation related to an allegation of sexual misconduct should be reported to the
Office.
2. Other misconduct
Retaliation related to an allegation of other misconduct — Emotional Misconduct,
Physical Misconduct, Bullying Behaviors, Hazing, Harassment or proactive policies —
should be reported to the relevant, promulgating organization.

MILLION

In America, drowning is the leading
cause of death for children younger
than 4 ... the second leading cause of
death for children under 14.

But we know the cure.

Swimming lessons can reduce the risk
of childhood drowning by 88 percent.

The USA Swimming Foundation and

our Make a Splash Tour, presented by
Phillips 66, have worked for a decade
to support local swim lesson providers
in.delivering 6 million swim lessons to
children-across the United States.
