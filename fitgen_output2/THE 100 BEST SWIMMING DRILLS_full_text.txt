Introduction
As long as I have been a swimming coach, I have shied away from
the “self help” approach to swimming improvement. The reason is
that I believe there is no replacement for an experienced eye
observing a swimmer’s stroke in action. While a particular stroke
may seem right to a swimmer doing it, analysis by a coach can
provide valuable insight about subtle, but important stroke flaws
that are present. Unchecked, the swimmer can end up practicing and
perfecting flawed technique. Without intervention, stroke flaws may
be repeated over and over again, becoming habit. This can slow
progress, cause frustration with the sport, and, in some instances,
eventually lead to injury.
A coach’s input is important. By looking beyond what seems to be
even a picture perfect stroke, to the heart of swimming efficiency, a
coach can identify problem areas and teach the swimmer to avoid
poor stroke habits through correct practice. One of the ways coaches
encourage correct practice is with swimming drills. Specific drills,
targeting specific aspects of the stroke, help the swimmer practice
correct technique and relearn ingrained swimming patterns. Once
stroke flaws are identified, the swimmer can use stroke drills to
address problem areas, and successfully practice on his or her own.
So, the purpose of this book is not to encourage coachless
swimming, but to give you tools to work on stroke problems
identified by your coach. And while the quest for better swimming
is universal, every coach has his or her favorite drills. There are
many paths to swimming efficiency. Out of the thousands of
swimming drills that have been developed by coaches and
swimmers over time, these represent this coach’s 100 favorite. Study
them. Know their purpose. Try them. Practice them, and practice
more. But above all, ask your coach for feedback. There is nothing
more valuable than that.

How to Use this Book
This book has been designed for use in two ways. If you are seeking
to improve your swimming efficiency all around, you can start with
the first drill and work your way through the book, one stroke at a
time. The book is organized into sections by stroke: freestyle,
backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly. Within each stroke section,
the drills are arranged into subsections addressing body position,
kick, arm stroke, breathing, leverage and coordination. Working from
start to finish, you can build the technique of one stroke, and then
move on to the next.
Or, if you wish to focus on a particular stroke problem, you can turn
directly to the section for that stroke. As often, one drill is built upon
the skills of the previous drill, it is advisable to read the whole
stroke section. After becoming familiar with the basic concepts of the
stroke, then focus in on the particular subsection addressing the
aspect of technique that you want to work on. Build your technique
one drill at a time. Finally, turn to the subsection on coordination,
and use these drills to reintegrate your stroke with your new
technique.
Whichever approach you choose, it is important to study the purpose
of each drill, and to keep that purpose in mind while practicing.
Follow the steps and refer to the diagrams and photos to perform the
drill correctly. Don’t get discouraged if things don’t fall into place right
away. Drills are meant to be repeated, and repeated again. Check the
Drill Feedback Charts to identify problems. Make modifications and
try again. Practice over several visits to the pool. Above all, spend
lots of time in the water, and enjoy every minute of it.

In PursuitOf EfficientSwimming
IN PURSUIT OF EFFICIENT 1
SWIMMING
THE ART AND THE SCIENCE OF SWIMMING
The process of becoming an efficient swimmer involves using both
the body and the brain to “feel” and “understand” what is going on.
When a swimmer “feels” fluid movement through the water, and
“understands” the cause and effect of specific actions, that swimmer
is prepared to pursue efficient swimming.
The art of swimming is all about “feeling” effective movement
through the water. It is probably best described as “being at one
with the water”. A good example of the art of swimming is when
good swimmers refer to feeling fishlike in the water. The movement
achieved by efficient swimmers is fluid, like the strokes of an artist’s
brush. It is also graceful, as a swimmer uses balance, rhythm and
posture, much like the art of dance. And, it is powerful, like musical
harmony, as the combined actions of the swimmer’s body produce a
greater result to each action alone. The art of swimming means a
swimmer is able to “feel” the water, rather than fight it.
The science of swimming is all about “understanding” movement
through the water. There is a lot of physics at work in swimming. By
understanding these principles, a swimmer can learn to apply them
to the water. Coach Doc Counsilman, revered as “the father of
modern swimming” described the ingredients in successful
swimming as “water, brains and guts.” Using the science of
swimming, a swimmer can study movement through the water as an
equation, and can begin to figure it out. The science of swimming
means a swimmer is able to “understand” how to produce the most
propulsion with the least effort.
Because good swimming is a matter of feeling and understanding,
the most beneficial practice engages both body and brain.

The 100 BestSwimming Drills
Swimming drills are examples of this kind of practice. Drills are
extremely useful tools because they encourage the swimmer to
approach swimming as both an art and a science.
THE TECHNIQUE OF ECONOMIC SWIMMING
The first step in becoming an efficient swimmer, is becoming an
economic swimmer. The distinction between these two stages is
subtle, but very important to understand in working through the
progression of swimming development. Economic swimming refers
to managing the energy resources required for the effort of
swimming. Swimming efficiency refers to the quality and quantity
produced through that effort.
How a swimmer manages his or her energy makes a big difference in
how much effort can be put forth to swim faster for longer.
Swimming that requires more effort uses more energy that is
depleted more quickly. The amount of energy a swimmer has
available, like gas in the tank of a car, is not unlimited. The effort it
takes to move through the water is one of the primary variables
that makes one swimmer faster than another swimmer. Through
ongoing attention to the mechanics of swimming, a swimmer can
learn to move through the water with less effort, and become an
economic swimmer.
The foundation of economic swimming is solid swimming technique
that allows a swimmer to minimize drag, to develop “feel” for the
water, and to access potential power. By learning to minimize drag,
swimmers can make prudent use of their effort, and save energy. By
learning to feel the water, swimmers can be thrifty with their energy,
avoiding the wasted effort of extra strokes. By learning to access
potential power, swimmers can expend less energy, by engaging the
muscle groups best suited to move the body forward with the least
effort.
One of the best ways to make the connection between swimming
technique and economic swimming is through swimming drills. Drills

In PursuitOf EfficientSwimming
for swimming technique are useful tools in feeling and
understanding economic swimming. Swimming drills teach economic
swimming by focusing on the mechanics that allow a swimmer to
move through the water with less drag, better feeling for the water,
and more access to potential power.
TURNING WORKOUT INTO PRACTICE
Efficient swimming is achieved when the valuable energy conserved
through the technique of economic swimming, can be applied to
sustaining speed over time in the water. The bridge from economic
to efficient swimming should be formed in two ways. First, a
swimmer should devote time in the water to ongoing practice of
economic swimming based on good technique. This includes active
work on positive floatation, productive kicking, aligned and
accelerating arm stroke, balanced recovery, rhythmic breathing, and
effective use of core leverage. Simultaneously, a swimmer should
dedicate time to developing the conditioning and strength necessary
to apply that solid swimming, stroke after stroke. This includes
increasing cardiovascular endurance, well-rounded fitness, and
muscle tone, as well as building fast twitch muscle fiber, and an
increased threshold for the repetitive action of swimming.
Too often, concern with stroke technique is left behind soon after a
swimmer is able to produce forward motion, and time and attention
are devoted to conditioning only. This one-sided approach is
reinforced as the swimmer is rewarded by rapid improvement, often
for quite a while. However, there comes a point when improvement
through conditioning alone stops, because working out is only half
the formula to improved swimming.
Regular attention to technique increases a swimmer’s capacity for
improvement, by developing swimming that requires less effort. The
swimmer is then able to apply energy saved to building better
swimming through efficient strokes. By focusing on solid stroke
mechanics during every swimming session, a swimmer can transform

a workout from an opportunity to swim more, into an opportunity to
practice efficient swimming.
Swimming drills are excellent tools to focus a swimmer’s efforts
toward swimming efficiency. They can be strategically incorporated
into any swim session. A routine that includes specific practice, like
drills, rather than just workout, allows a swimmer to experience long
term swimming improvement by building efficient swimming from
the technique side and the conditioning side simultaneously.

WhatDrills Are All About
WHAT DRILLS 2
ARE ALL ABOUT
WHAT IS A DRILL?
A drill is a structured method of practice used to acquire a skill,
procedure or sequence. We use drills to acquire a vast array of
everyday and specialized skills. We use drills to learn everything
from cursive writing to tying our shoes, from cheer leading
formations to military exercises. Drills are designed to make a
particular skill, sequence or procedure easier to absorb, retain and
recall. They combine a thinking and feeling approach to learning, so
skills can be developed, practiced and performed better.
Drills are widely used by athletes to master and excel at physically
demanding skills that require precise technique, and quick,
continuous application. In swimming, a drill can be defined as:
• An activity designed to develop and practice good stroke
habits
• Arepetitive exercise for improving and perfecting stroke
technique
• Away of isolating part of a complex stroke sequence, to
learn and perform it correctly
Swimming drills address various aspects of the stroke, including:
BODY POSITION
As human beings, we are comfortable and agile moving about on
land. We have mastered vertical balance. To be a good swimmer, we
must become equally comfortable and agile in the water. We have to
master horizontal balance, or floating. Just as we are able to shift
17

SwimmingDrills 1-98 89899-337-3(2011) 20.05.2011 15:42 Uhr Seite 18
The 100 BestSwimming Drills
our weight forward and from side to side to do things better and
easier on land, we must learn this skill in the water. Learning to float
well is an essential skill for swimming efficiently. Our spine and core
strength are key in allowing us to stand erectly, and they are equally
crucial in floating correctly. Swimmers are well served by giving
special attention to learning how to stabilize their core in the water.
Developing this skill allows the swimmer to be in control of how he
or she floats. It reduces drag, improves feel for the water, and
increases access to power. It encourages the swimmer to achieve the
important feeling of swimming “downhill”.
KICK
The role of the legs in swimming is to provide forward momentum,
rhythm, and counterbalance to other actions of the stroke. While the
large muscles of the legs are an invaluable resource to swimmers,
they demand a great deal of oxygen. It is therefore worthwhile to
develop good kicking skills. Swimmers should strive to develop both
a productive and a sustainable kick. Aproductive kick can relieve the
upper body of some of the workload. A sustainable kick is
economical in terms of energy expenditure. Although a consequence
of kicking is that the legs will float better, this should not be the
primary focus of kicking. Kicking should be used for forward motion,
not to correct floating problems. Kicking well requires a swimmer to
have relaxed feet and ankles, fluid motion, and above all to keep the
feet connected to the water.
ARM STROKE
The power phase of the arm stroke, or what the arms do underwater
to move us forward must be worked on in three dimensions: length,
width and depth. Although the path of the arms is unique to each
stroke, the arms have three basic functions in all strokes. The arms
are the primary tools we use to maximize the length of our stroke.
Longer strokes mean fewer strokes. Fewer strokes mean less energy
to cover a certain distance. The arms are also used to move the
body forward, in the straightest, most direct path to our destination.
18

SwimmingDrills 1-98 89899-337-3(2011) 20.05.2011 15:42 Uhr Seite 19
WhatDrills Are All About
Using sculling or sweeping motions, the arm action increases speed
as it travels through the stroke, causing the body to advance. Most
importantly of all, the arms are used to position our hands so we
can best feel the water. Hands that are able to feel the water are
able use the water like a handle. With a firm hold on the water, the
swimmer can best move his or her body forward past the point at
which the hands are anchored.
RECOVERY
The recovery follows the underwater arm stroke, returning the arm to
its starting point in front for another stroke. In all strokes except
breaststroke, recovery is the phase when the swimmer’s arms can
rest momentarily. Learning to relax during recovery is an important
skill to develop in working towards the most economical swimming
style. Alignment of the recovery is often overlooked as a factor in
swimming efficiency. A misaligned recovery can lead to a misaligned
arm stroke, requiring constant correcting to be done, at the expense
of forward motion. An aligned recovery is also an excellent
preventive measure in remaining pain and injury free in the
vulnerable shoulder area. Lastly, a relaxed and aligned recovery
works to balance the rest of the stroke. Even though the recovery
does not itself move a swimmer forward, it is by nature connected to
the other actions of the stroke. It is important to recover in a way
that complements and perpetuates the forward motion of the stroke.
BREATHING
Replenishing the body with oxygen is an integral part of any sport,
but in swimming, the added challenge of doing so while in the water
makes breathing a primary aspect of swimming technique. Swimmers
must learn to breathe rhymically to best fuel their bodies. In
addition, they must learn to inhale and exhale within the line of the
stroke to avoid disrupting the forward motion of their swimming. In
general, timing the inhale with the stroke’s recovery, and timing the
exhale to the power phase makes breathing fit into the forward
motion best, without creating insurmountable drag. This timing also

SwimmingDrills 1-98 89899-337-3(2011) 20.05.2011 15:42 Uhr Seite 20
The 100 BestSwimming Drills
places the exhale to the part of the stroke that demands the most
exertion. So as in other sports, and in life in general, the swimmer
can summon more power by expelling air while applying force. Some
scholars of swimming believe that the rhythm of swimming should
actually be determined by a swimmer’s natural breathing rhythm.
This theory makes breathing the central focus in developing the
most effective stroke rate, pace, and strategy. Whether you are
sprinting a 50 or swimming a mile, breathing technique is a factor in
your ability to swim better.
LEVERAGE
Although we use our limbs to press against the water, the power to
use them comes from our core. Like a ceiling fan, with its blades
turning, what is propelling the movement is the motor in the middle,
or in the case of the swimmer, the core. This core-centered power is
visible in many forms of athletics. Observe a baseball pitcher
preparing to throw the ball. It is the pitcher’s arm throwing the ball,
yet look at the pitcher’s hips and shoulders turn to the side in
preparation. As the ball leaves the hand, the same side hip and
shoulder snap forward. It is actually the core that is powering that
pitch. You can observe this same core leverage in action with the
batter as well. You can see it in a golfer, a boxer, and an ice skater,
among others.
Leverage is also present in the limbs while swimming. To access
available leverage, swimmers must learn to stabilize their joints,
especially the elbows and the knees. Observe fish. They don’t have
elbows or knees. If our goal is to swim as efficiently as fish, we have
to learn to stabilize our joints, and not allow them to collapse and
weaken our levers.
COORDINATION
The numerous actions that make up swimming are each pieces in a
puzzle, that when fitted correctly together, create fluid, graceful and
powerful forward motion. Each action has its purpose, and its
20

WhatDrills Are All About
relationship to the whole. While it is important to develop each
action in itself, connecting them together so they work in harmony is
what efficient swimming is all about. We must learn to use our kick
with our arms, not just in addition to our arms. We must learn to
breathe within the line of the stroke, so the necessary act of
breathing does not interrupt our forward motion. We must learn to
deliberately use good body position to access leverage, which
affects the arm stroke, recovery, breathing and kick.
Swimming efficiently is a matter of coordinated action. We must
learn to time each action so that it complements the other elements
of the stroke, rather than working against them. We must strive to
develop our weakest actions, and make the most of our strongest
ones. All of this must be done with one goal in mind: to move
through the water with less effort so it can be done faster and
longer.
TYPES OF SWIMMING DRILLS
Swimming is a complex sequence of actions. Like driving, playing
guitar, or typing, multiple crucial actions are performed at once, or in
tight succession. Correct technique is necessary or the result is
unsatisfactory. Certain types of drills are very successful for
developing skills that are complex in nature, like swimming. These
include:
PROGRESSION BASED DRILLS
Swimming drills based in “progression” allow the swimmer to build a
stroke, one piece at a time. Beginning with a basic skill, the
swimmer can concentrate on developing the stroke in steps, from
simple to complex. Once the first action is mastered, the swimmer
can add on another part. Eventually, all the parts of the stroke are
connected, and the swimmer can then feel and understand them in
the context of the coordinated stroke.

PART PRACTICE
When a stroke flaw is identified, new stroke habits can be
established with “part practice” drills. Part practice encourages
positive change by isolating a particular action of the stroke, and
providing repetitive practice of just that part of the stroke. By
narrowing the focus, the swimmer is able to relearn a weak part of
their stroke, and implement the new correct technique upon
resuming the full stroke.
CONTRAST DRILLS
To underscore the correct way of doing a skill, “contrast drills” start
by having the swimmer perform the skill incorrectly. The skill is then
immediately repeated, with specific changes, which correct the
technique. By contrasting the right and the wrong way of performing
a skill, the swimmer is guided to choose the better technique by
noticing better results from using the correct technique. Using
negative examples is a controversial practice, however, when
followed up with correct practice, can be an effective learning tool.
X DRILLS
In order to emphasize a particular point of technique, “X drills” use
eXaggeration to demonstrate the effect of a particular stroke action.
By taking a skill to the eXtreme, a swimmer can more clearly feel the
desired technique. When the swimmer is able to eXperience the full
effect of a particular technique, its purpose is more obvious. X drills
allow the swimmer to eXplore the full range of a stroke action and to
discover how to best balance various stroke actions with each other.
HISTORY OF SWIMMING DRILLS
Swimming has been a part of the human experience throughout
history. Little is known about the methods used by early civilizations
to acquire swimming skills, but swimming is depicted in Egyptian

WhatDrills Are All About
and Assyrian art dating back to 2000 B.C. Probably originally learned
for survival, artifacts show that swimming was used for military
purposes as well as leisure in ancient times. It is mentioned in the
Bible, and was considered an important part of education by the
Romans. Swimming was called the highest sport by the prophet
Mohammed. It was also one of the original “agilities” needed to
become a knight.
The first books addressing the technique of swimming were
published beginning in the 1500s. Reflecting the European view of
swimming as an activity of culture and sophistication, the technique
described resembled the breaststroke. The first swimming drills were
presented as diagrams for study and emulation. Later, land practice
became a popular method of teaching swimming skills. Learners
practiced the swimming actions by moving the arms and legs
through the air in a repetitive, disciplined manner. However, this land
drill method failed to address floatation, an essential aspect of
swimming. Without experience in the water, learners often met with
serious consequences! By the 1700s, a drastically different swimming
technique was recorded by explorers of the New World, who were
fascinated by the alternating over arm stroke they saw among the
natives. Although described as superior in speed to their own style,
the new swimming technique was not adopted by the Europeans for
some time, as their view of good technique centered on graceful
swimming, not fast swimming.
When swimming became an official sport in the early 1800s, the goal
of swimming became speed. Swimmers experimented with new
techniques, and trial and error led to the development of new
strokes, including the side stroke, trudgen, and finally the crawl
stroke. By the beginning of the 20th century, early swimming
coaches were known as professors of swimming claimed to hold the
secrets to winning techniques. Beginning in the 1920s, coaches
filmed the best swimmers, and used the moving pictures as training
tools. By the 1950s, four distinct competitive strokes had been
established, with rules defining the acceptable technique for each.
Coaches focused on developing speed by having their swimmers do
repeat drills, or interval training.

In the 1960s, Coach Doc Counsilman revolutionized the approach to
developing swimming speed by addressing swimming efficiency.
Using established science to explain swimming propulsion,
Counsilman’s work focused on the technique of efficient swimming.
In an effort to teach this kind of swimming, Counsilman contributed
concepts still practiced today, including sculling, and leverage. Over
the past forty years, the training methods for competitive swimming
have developed rapidly, but practicing good technique with
swimming drills has remained a part of training programs at all
levels of the sport. Alexander Popov, the “Russian Rocket” promoted
freestyle with the dolphin kick. Inge deBraun’s coach had her spend
hours doing single leg kicking. Natalie Couglin rose to world class
status training with no arm work. USASwimming endorses technique
development from the earliest levels of the competitive swimming
with the slogan “a skill done 99 % correctly is 100 % wrong”.
Swimming drills of one kind or another have been used throughout
history and they continue to be an effective part of the development
of swimmers from novice to world class.

USING SWIMMING DRILLS
WHEN TO USE DRILLS
Because swimming drills are one of a swimmer’s best tools for
practicing toward efficient swimming, they should be included in
every swim session. They can be done as a part of warm-up to
establish a foundation for the rest of the practice. They can be used
within a set to remind the swimmer of the correct technique as they
are working hard and might otherwise sacrifice quality for quantity.
They can be used between sets to refocus the swimmer on the goal
of swimming efficiently.
Swimming drills are also an excellent part of preparation for
competition. As a part of taper, swimming drills provide the
swimmer with quality swimming that is less intensive, so the
swimmer can maintain a feel for the water while achieving overall
recovery from training workload. On race day, drills are excellent as a
part of warm-up, allowing the swimmer to practice ideal stroke
actions as he or she focuses on the race to come.
During the off-season, a swimmer can use swimming drills almost
exclusively to maintain conditioning and practice stroke economy
and improve efficiency for the next season.
HOW TO USE DRILLS
When practicing any swimming drill, it is very important to know the
purpose of the drill. Just performing a drill is not enough. Doing a
drill without understanding its purpose is empty swimming. Without
understanding what the desired outcome of the drill is, a swimmer
cannot get the full benefit out of practicing it. To be fully engaged, a
swimmer must think about and feel both what is supposed to
happen, and, what is happening in the drill.
25

The 100 BestSwimming Drills
As certain drills are designed to focus a swimmer’s practice on a very
specific part of the stroke, it is important to concentrate on that
particular point, and ignore the rest. For example, a certain drill for
kicking may require the arms to be at the sides. This can make
breathing difficult, and not at all like the breathing technique used in
the complete stroke. But, in this drill, it is important to remember
that breathing is not the point. Focusing on the breathing, rather
than the kicking, defeats the purpose of the drill.
Likewise, a swimmer must know the correct sequence of the drill,
and perform each step correctly. This is important to feel the full
effect of the action being performed in the drill. Skipping a step
reinforces incorrect technique, and can interfere with achieving the
desired outcome. Sometimes, the skipped step is the very one that
represents the problem area. Start by practicing each drill slowly.
Many drills seem awkward at first, but like any new thing, they get
better with practice. Spend time on each drill. Identify problems and
make the needed modifications to do the drill right.
There are drills that are designed to be done at swim speed, and
drills that are not. Some drills are done in a stationary position.
Remember, your concern should not be with the amount of yardage
you do, but the quality of what you are doing. Once you are able to
do the drill correctly, it can be helpful to alternate laps of drill and
swim so the new technique can work in the context of the full
stroke.
Remember, there is no rush. By using drills to practice the technique
of swimming, you become fully engaged in the process of reaching
for swimming efficiency. The achievement of efficient swimming is an
excellent goal, but the process toward that goal can be equally
rewarding. Each positive change becomes a revelation. Each new
skill learned becomes like a piece in a puzzle, discovered
unexpectedly after a long search. Every improvement empowers you
to pursue another.

BODY POSITION DRILLS
An efficient freestyle is built on good body position. The way we
float in the water is affected by our core tension. For a better
freestyle, we must learn to shift weight forward, and achieve a
“downhill” floating position. The goal of the following drills for body
position is to experience an advantageous float and effective core
stability.
1111
Downhill Float
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Learning to shift weight to achieve a “downhill” floating position
• Understanding the importance of a correct head position
• Feeling effective core tension and stability
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Float face down in the water, with your arms at your sides, in
a head leading position. Don’t attempt any forward motion.
Step 2: Notice your body position. For most people, the legs will
soon begin to sink, leaving the swimmer in an “uphill” floating
position.
Step 3: To begin correcting this disadvantageous floating position,
lower your chin, so you are looking at the bottom of the pool, not
forward. For many people, this simple action will have a positive
effect on their float, including raising their sinking legs a bit.
Step 4: Now focus on your spine. Make it as straight as possible by
contracting your abdominal muscles and pulling your bellybutton in.
Learning to achieve and maintain a straight spine through core
tension is an important skill that can be applied to all strokes.
Step 5: While holding your core stable, lean forward on your chest.
Doing so should allow your hips and legs to rise toward the surface

of the water. This is the desirable “downhill” floating position upon
which you can build a good freestyle.
Step 6: Stand, breathe and again lay horizontally in the water, face
down, this time with your arms extended over your head, hands
leading. Look at the bottom of the pool, achieve a straight spine and
stable core. Shift your weight forward and feel the “downhill” float.

Twelve Kick Switch Freestyle
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Maintaining a “downhill” float while moving
• Beginning to feel leverage from the core
• Identifying the longest freestyle position
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Float on your side in the water, arm towards the surface at
your side, the arm closest to the bottom of the pool extended over
your head. Engage core tension to achieve the “downhill” float.
Step 2: Begin a gentle but continuous flutter kick, which should also
be directed side to side, rather than up and down.
Step 3: If you are properly aligned, your face will be mostly
submerged. To breathe, maintain a stable head position and roll
towards your back, breathe, then roll back to your original side
position. Create a regular breathing interval.
Step 4: Kick twelve times (each leg equals one kick).

KICK DRILLS
A productive flutter kick is part of a good freestyle. It provides
constant momentum, and counterbalance to the arm stroke. Because
the legs require a disproportionate amount of energy, developing a
relaxed, sustainable kick is important. The goal of the following
freestyle kicking drills is to learn to use an economical flutter kick
that will enhance the rest of the freestyle stroke.

raise your chin gently to the surface, then to return your face to the
water, and bring your hands back together in an extended position.
Step 2: Begin doing the flutter kick, using alternating up and down
motion with your leg. Kick to a depth of about twelve to fifteen
inches, and up to the surface of the water. Kick briskly with relaxed,
but fairly straight legs.
Step 3: Focus on your foot position. To best engage the water, you
must use the largest surface of your feet to push against the water.
Position your feet so your toes are pointed. Kick briskly for 30
seconds. Feel the tops and the bottoms of your feet push the water
as your feet sweep up and down.
Step 4: Now, flex your feet at the ankles, setting them at right
angles to your leg (the standing foot position). Kick briskly for 30
seconds. Feel the smaller surface with which you are pushing the
water. Notice that you don’t move forward well. Some people can
even move backwards with this foot position!
Step 5: Now, reposition your feet so your toes are pointed, and
rotate your knees and feet inward, so that your toes are closer
together than your heels. Together, your feet should form a point.
Kick briskly for 30 seconds. Feel a larger foot surface pressing against
the water. Notice that your kick is much more effective, with much
less effort, and that there is

Floppy Foot Drill
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Developing a relaxed kick
• Experiencing fish-like propulsion
• Learning to conserve energy
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Observe a fish swimming. Any fish will do: your pet gold
fish, or a shark at the aquarium. Notice the tail as the fish swims. It
is not rigid, rather it moves back and forth in the water like a flag in
the breeze. It is fluid. The movement is not frantic, rather, it appears
to be an effortless action for the fish.
Step 2: Put on a single, long swim fin on one foot and stand in the
water, and stand in the water with your back against the wall,
submerging the entire fin under the water. Sweep your leg up and
down in the water covering about twenty four inches of distance
each way. Use enough speed so you feel the resistance of the fin
against the water. Notice how the water bends the fin as it moves.
Notice how when your leg sweeps in the one direction, the fin bends
the opposite way. The movement is fluid, like the tail of the fish.
Step 3: Now, take off the fin and float
face down in the water, arms extended.
Begin kicking briskly, keeping your feet
connected to the water, moving within
about fifteen inches of depth. Point
your toes, but relax your feet so the
water bends them like it did the fin.
Kick briskly for 30 seconds. Think about
the effortless and fluid motion of the
fish tail. Let the water move your foot
as if it was a flag in the wind. Rest,
then practice again.

Vertical Kicking Sequence
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Understanding the importance of foot speed
• Engaging the correct muscles for flutter kick
• Feeling the water with your feet
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: In water at least as deep as you are tall, get into a vertical
position. Engage your core. Begin a gentle sculling action (tracing
side to side underwater figure eights with your hands) to keep your
head above water.
Step 2: Without producing forward or backwards motion, begin
kicking the flutter kick, moving your extended legs in a sweeping
motion alternately so that when one foot is forward, the other is
back, within a range of approximately twelve to fifteen inches. Your
toes should be pointed towards the bottom of the pool, and your
feet and knees should be rotated slightly inward.
Step 3: Focus on the muscles you are engaging. They should be the
large muscles, high in your legs. As you move your leg forward, you
should be feeling your quadriceps. As you move your leg back, you
should feel your hamstrings and glutes working.
Step 4: Your legs should be fairly straight, yet not locked at the
knee as you kick.
As you increase the
speed of your kick,
forward and backward,
avoid raising your
knees as if marching
or bicycling. It should

Step 5: Kick even faster. Try to achieve a
fluid motion that makes your legs feel as if
they have no bones. Try to maintain your
head up while kicking for 30 seconds.
Step 6: Once you have achieved a fluid,
comfortable kick, it is time to check its
effectiveness by stopping the sculling action
with your hands. Cross your hands over your
chest positioning your left hand on the right
shoulder, and your right hand on your left
shoulder. Kick, keeping your head above

ARM STROKE DRILLS
With the long, sweeping, alternating arm action of the freestyle
stroke, humans are capable of producing the most potential speed
of all the strokes. To develop an efficient freestyle, the swimmer
must be concerned with three things. First, achieving correct
alignment is crucial to begin the stroke from a position of strength.
Second, maintaining a high elbow position is important to hold on
to the water. Third, accelerating through the arm stroke is necessary
to fully benefit from the stroke action. The goal of the following arm
stroke drills for freestyle is to develop a productive arm stroke, to
make the most of the power phase of the stroke.
8888
Pull/Push Freestyle
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Feeling the path of the freestyle arm stroke
• Achieving a high elbow position
• Using the full length of the stroke
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall, face down, arms extended, core engaged,
looking at the bottom of the pool. Establish a continuous flutter kick.
Step 2: Do a freestyle arm stroke with your right arm. Start by
pitching your fingertips and the palm of your hand down slightly,
adjusting them to press back on the water, instead of pressing down.
Allow your forearm to follow, but keep your elbow high and firm.
Sweep your hand slightly outward and down, then inward until it lines
up under your shoulder. At this point, your elbow should be in line
with your hand and shoulder, but sticking out as if you were trying to
nudge someone. This is the “pull” portion of the freestyle arm stroke.
Step 3:From there, press back quickly on the water with your hand.
Feel your hand pass your elbow. Adjust the pitch of your hand to
maintain pressure back on the water. Sweep your hand back until

THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Practicing a long stroke
• Feeling acceleration in the arm stroke
• Developing a high elbow underwater arm stroke
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall, face down,
arms extended, core engaged, looking at
the bottom of the pool. Your arms should
be aligned in front of your shoulders, not
in front of your nose. Establish a
continuous flutter kick, which should be
maintained throughout the drill.
Step 2: With your right arm still
extended and aligned with the
shoulder, perform a single freestyle arm
stroke with your left arm. With your
fingertips and palm pitched down
slightly, press back on the water, not
down. Keep your elbow high and firm
as your forearm follows your hand. Pull
then push, sweeping your hand from
deep to shallow toward your hip,
accelerating the motion from front to
back, until your arm is straight at
your side.
Step 3: From this position, your right
arm extended in front of you, and left
arm at your side, feel the full length of
your stroke. Return the left arm over
the water to the starting point, so both
arms are again at full extension. Then,
perform a single stroke with your right FIGURE 9: Catch Up Freestyle

Step 4: This sequence continues as one arm “catches up” to the
other at the front of the stroke. Breathing is performed as needed,
toward the moving arm, as the hand accelerates to the back of the
stroke. Roll your face to the side to get a new breath. Keep the
reaching arm extended and aligned with the shoulder as you inhale.
Return your face to the water as your arm passes over the water.
Step 5: Continue for several lengths of the pool. Feel the
momentum of each arm stroke as you press back on the water,
accelerating through the pull, then push to full extension. Notice that
there is always one arm leading and one arm stroking.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Learning to avoid over-reaching to the center at entry
• Practicing aligned extension
• Initiating the arm stroke from a position of strength
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: On land we point at things using our “pointer finger”. Try it.
Notice that this is largely a hand only position, and that the rest of
the arm is not involved in the pointing motion. In swimming,
because the purpose of pointing is to align our stroke forward, we
use the whole arm. To best accomplish this, we have to learn to
point with our thumbs.
Step 2: Standing in the
water, extend your arm fully
in front of you. Use your
thumb to point to the far end
of the pool. Notice when you
point with your thumb, your
shoulder, the inside of your
elbow, and your thumb all

by pushing your elbow and wrist in a straight line. Notice the alignment:
shoulder, the inside of your elbow, and your thumb all line up straight
ahead. You should feel like you are almost gliding forward directly toward
your destination. Swim, thumbs leading to the far end of the pool.
Step 4: Continue to practice beginning your stroke aligned forward
with your thumbs. Pitch your fingertips and palm downward, your
thumb slightly lower than your pinkie. Feel the water against your
fingertips take hold of the water like a handle. Move your body
forward past your hand. Notice that when you begin the stroke from
a well aligned position, you are able to feel more of a “handle” on
the water.
Step 5:Practice more, beginning each new stroke from this position
of strength with your thumbs leading. Feel the length of your stroke
increase. Feel yourself move through the water farther with each
stroke as you access more power.

• Learning to hold on to the water
• Practicing changing hand pitch
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Standing in shoulder-deep water, position your hands
completely underwater, palms facing each other, about 24 inches
apart. Hold your elbows firmly against your body. Sweep your hands
towards each other. Just before they meet, sweep your hands down
and back away from each other about 24 inches apart. Notice your
hands have gone from a thumbs-up to a thumbs-down position.

Step 2: Upon reaching the widest point, again sweep your hands
down and around until they are moving towards each other. Notice
that your hands have gone from a thumbs-down position to a
thumbs-up position. Continue this action until you feel you are
tracing a sideways figure eight with each hand.
Step 3: You should be feeling that your hands are holding
something of substance. Some swimmers describe the feeling of
holding gelatin, others refer to pressing against something solid.
Hold on to this substance in both directions, and as you turn the
corners of your figure eight. This is sculling.
Step 4: Now lay in the water, face down, in a hand lead position.
Accompanied by a light flutter kick, begin sculling with your arms
extended. Adjust your hands so they remain completely submerged.
Press outward with your thumbs down, and inward with your thumbs
up. Hold on to the water throughout the sculling action. Attempt to
create forward motion for 30 seconds.
Step 5:In the same floating position, move your hands under your
belly, and using your sculling action, attempt to create forward
motion in this position for 30 seconds.
Step 6: In the same floating position, move your hand to your sides,
and using your sculling action, attempt to create forward motion in
this position for 30 seconds.
Step 7: Once you have developed the ability to hold on to the water
while sculling, try it when swimming freestyle. As your arm
accelerates from front to back, feel the elongated sculling action.
Hold on to the water
throughout the whole path
of the stroke. Adjust your
hand as it sweeps through
the stroke to maintain your
hold on the water.

HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall preparing to do regular freestyle. Before
the first stroke, form closed fists with each hand.
Step 2: Start the arm stroke. At first it may seem impossible to
make forward progress without the paddle of your open hand. Keep
sweeping through the path of the stroke, positioning your arm so
your forearm works as your paddle to press against the water. To
achieve this, you must keep your elbows high and stable, and to

RECOVERY DRILLS
Although there are many effective styles of freestyle recovery, they
all have common aspects of technique. They all release the water.
Each balances the stroking arm. All of them use a relaxed hand that
is higher than the shoulder. The goal of the following freestyle
recovery drills is to develop a recovery that maximizes rest while
complementing the rest of the stroke.
11113333
Floppy Hand
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Practicing a relaxed recovery
• Learning to rest the arm during recovery
• Maintaining a high elbow recovery
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall and begin to do the “Catch Up” drill. As
one arm remains reaching, the other will perform the underwater
stroke. When the stroking arm reaches full extension to the rear,
deliberately relax that hand.
Step 2: To transition to recovery, lift your elbow and slide you hand
out of the water. It should feel as if you are pulling it out of your
front pocket. Once your hand is clear of the water, your elbow
should remain higher than your hand throughout its path over the
water.
Step 3: Perform the recovery in slow motion focusing on relaxing
your hand the whole time. As your arm travels toward the front,
begin shaking your hand gently. Your hand should feel floppy and
relaxed, as if you have no bones in your wrist. Your fingertips, hand
and forearm should hang loosely from your elbow, pointing down
toward the surface of the water, not forward. It should feel as though
there is a puppet string pulling your elbow up, and everything else is
dangling from it.

Shark Fin
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Practicing a relaxed, high elbow recovery
• Achieving a high elbow recovery by floating on your side
• Practicing the release of the water
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Float in the water on your side, the arm near the surface at
your side, and the other arm extended in front. Kick productively. To
breathe, maintain core stability and roll towards your back, breathe,
then roll back to your original side position.
Step 2: While maintaining a continuous kick, slide the hand at your
side up to your waist, raising your elbow up to a point, like a shark’s
fin. Your elbow should be pointing to the sky. Hold this “shark fin”
position for five seconds, allowing your hand to hang relaxed. Slide
your hand back down to full extension at your side.

BREATHING DRILLS
Integrating the act of breathing into the stroke is a challenge. By
timing the breath to the natural roll of the stroke, a swimmer can
breathe rhythmically while continuing the forward line of the stroke.
The goal of the following freestyle breathing drills is to address
issues of timing and alignment, and, to learn to use the core for
better breathing technique.
11115555
Inhale Arm/Exhale Arm
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Learning the correct timing of the freestyle breathing
• Using a regular breathing pattern
• Maintaining a relaxed, rhythmic stroke with breathing
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Choose a side that you will turn toward for breathing. The
arm on that side will be called your “inhale arm”. The other arm will
be called your “exhale arm”.
Step 2: Standing in waist deep water, bow forward until your face is
submerged. Extend your arms forward, aligned with your shoulders
to do the freestyle arm stroke in the standing position. Do several
strokes, saying to your self “inhale”, as you are stroking underwater
with the “inhale arm”, and saying, “exhale”, as you are stroking with
the “exhale arm”.
Step 3: Now try to actually get a breath. Stroke first with your
“inhale arm”. As you begin to press back on the water, start turning
your face to the side toward the “inhale arm”. Turn your face until
your mouth clears the water, but keep your lower cheek in the water.
Inhale as your hand reaches the back of the stroke. Inhale deeply
through your mouth. Then, as the “inhale arm” returns over the
water to the front, allow your face to follow it, arriving back into the
water by the time the “inhale arm” passes your shoulder. Look at the
bottom of the pool.

Step 4: When your face returns to the water, begin stroking with the
“exhale arm”. As you begin to press back on the water, look down at
the bottom of the pool and exhale. Exhale through your mouth and
nose. You should see an abundance of bubbles as you exhale.
Continue exhaling throughout the length of the stroke, and as the
“exhale arm” returns over the water to the front.
Step 5: As your “exhale arm” passes your shoulder, again begin
stroking with the “inhale arm”. Continue stroking rhythmically,
inhaling with the one-arm stroke, and exhaling with the other.
Maintain the full length of each stroke. Do a quick, deep inhale
through your mouth. Do a long, thorough exhale from your mouth
and nose, producing bubbles. Practice until you can breathe
rhythmically with the rhythm of the stroke.

Step 6: Now try breathing while swimming freestyle. Start slowly.
Stroke several times saying to your self “inhale” and “exhale” as the
designated arm strokes through the water. Then try turning your
head toward the “inhale arm” as it strokes. Turn to the point that
your mouth clears the water but your cheek remains connected to
the water. Inhale as your arm reaches the back of the stroke. Then,
allow your face to turn back into the water, following your “inhale
arm” as it recovers back to the front. Exhale as the “exhale arm”
strokes.
Step 7: Practice several times then rest. Practice again. Be patient
and set the rhythm of your arm stroke to your inhale and exhale.

The Weightless Arm
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Maintaining the full length of the arm stroke while breathing
• Learning the correct timing of the freestyle breathing
• Using your core to breathe, not just your head
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall for freestyle. Achieve a firm core and look
at the bottom of the pool. Swim to the far end of the pool. Begin
swimming freestyle. Establish a relaxed stroke and regular breathing
rhythm. Inhale with one arm, exhale with the other.

The 100 BestSwimming Drills
Step 2: When you have reached about the halfway mark to the
other end of the pool, at the exact point when your mouth clears the
water to inhale, freeze in that position. Identify precisely where the
arm is that you are turned away from when breathing. Has it left the
fully extended position? Is it under your chest? If the answer to
either of these questions is “yes”, you have a heavy arm. As this
heavy arm presses down on the water in an attempt to lift you up to
breathe, it works like an anchor. When your arm sinks, you lose half
of your next stroke that could have moved you forward in the water.
Step 3: To avoid a heavy arm, float on your side, with your
breathing side higher in the water. Extend your lower arm fully in
front of you. Position the higher arm at your side. Begin a gentle
flutter kick. Holding your core firm, roll your face, shoulder and hip
as a unit back until your mouth clears the water. Inhale. Roll back

THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Practicing the correct head alignment while breathing
• Learning to use a “low profile” breathing technique
• Experiencing the bow wave when inhaling
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Stand in waist deep water. Bow forward at the waist and
submerge your face in the water. Look at the bottom of the pool.
Extend your arms in front of you on the surface of the water. Bring
one arm back toward your hip underwater, and turn to that side, as
if breathing in freestyle. Freeze in that position. What parts of your
head are connected to the water? Your jaw bone? Your cheek? How
about your temple?
Step 2: Adjust your head position so that your temple is pressing
down on the water. Notice that by doing so your cheek and your jaw
bone automatically connect to the water. Your mouth might not clear
the water as much as you are used to. That is fine.

LEVERAGE DRILLS
Using leverage gives freestlyers an advantage. Instead of swimming
flat, and depending on the small muscles of the arm, swimmers can
use the body to roll into and out of each stroke. Doing so accesses
more power from the core. By engaging the large muscles of the core
it is possible to travel more distance per stroke, with the same
amount of energy. The freestyle becomes more productive and more
sustainable. In addition, using core leverage avoids injury to
vulnerable shoulder joints. Long term flat freestyle is responsible for
many swimmers being out of the water for extended periods of time,
with bursitis or rotator cuff problems. By using core leverage, the
shoulders can be spared of the entire burden of freestyle. The goal
of the following freestyle leverage drills is to create a more
sustainable and injury-free freestyle by using available leverage to
the fullest.

Three Stroke Switch Freestyle
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Practicing the roll into and out of the stroke
• Accessing your core strength
• Transferring power from the core to the limbs
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall preparing to do freestyle, core engaged,
perform three freestyle strokes (one arm = one stroke), accompanied
by a productive flutter kick. As your arm approaches your hip on the
third stroke, roll onto your side and float and kick with the arm that
just finished stroking at your side, the other arm fully extended. The
arm at your side should be closer to the surface, and the arm lower
in the water should be extended over your head. Holding this
position, do six good kicks (one leg = one kick).
Step 2: With your sixth kick, roll your higher hip and shoulder down
into the water as the arm at your side recovers over the water to the

Notice that when changing from the side kicking phase to the
stroking phase, the recovering arm travels easily to the front with
leverage of the hip roll. Notice too, at the same time, that the
leading arm goes easily into the next stroke, also aided by the hip
roll.
Step 4: Keep practicing. Once you are comfortable with the
3 strokes and 6 kicks rhythm, change to 3 strokes and 3 kicks. Then,
work on incorporating a “switch” between each stroke. Notice that
what you are doing is almost identical to regular freestyle...a very
long, efficient freestyle.

The Pendulum Effect
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Understanding the relationship between the recovering arm and
the stroking arm
• Feeling acceleration during the switch
• Maintaining balance
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Float in the water on your side, the arm near the surface at
your side, and the other arm extended in front. Kick productively.
Slide the hand at your side up to your waist, raising your elbow up
to a point, like in the Shark Fin drill. To breathe, maintain your core
stability and roll towards your back, breathe, then roll back to your
original side position.
Step 2: Hold this position for five seconds, continuing to kick.
Notice that at in this position, on your side with one arm extended,
and the other arm at its highest point in recovery, neither arm is
producing any forward motion.

Step 3: Stroke through with your extended arm as you finish your
recovery with arm over the water. Find the same floating position on
the other side. Your lower arm should be extended, and your higher
arm should be making a shark fin. Again hold for five seconds,
continuing to kick.
Step 4: Switch to the other side again. Continue to the far end of
the pool, switching to the identical position with your arms on either
side, and holding for five seconds before switching. Notice that as
you switch arm positions, your hips switch sides too. Notice too that
each switch gathers speed from beginning to end.
Step 5: Do another length, this time holding only for three seconds
before switching sides. Feel the beginning and the end of each
switch. Like the extremes of a pendulum’s swing, the motion starts
slowly and gathers speed, continuously from side to side.
Step 6: Do another length, this time holding for only one second
before switching sides. Feel the pendulum swing and gather speed
with each switch. Notice that while one arm reaching and the other
out of the water in recovery, neither arm is moving you forward, yet
you are still moving forward.
Step 7: Continue to practice, feeling the pendulum effect with each
stroke. Focus on using your hips to add power to the switch of your
arm positions. Feel your stroke cover more distance with no more
effort.

Hip Skating
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL

• Learning to use leverage from the core
• Mastering switching from hip to hip
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: The rhythm of ice skating resembles the rhythm of
swimming freestyle. As one side of the body balances, the other is
applying force. To go faster, the ice skater does not do shorter,
choppier movements. Instead, each stride is extended, using
leverage from the hips to produce motion. Try it. Attach an imaginary

COORDINATION DRILLS
There are many elements of the stroke technique that make up
freestyle work in combination to produce coordinated forward
motion. Each element affects another, together contributing to a
unified, productive freestyle. The goal of the following coordination
drills is to learn to bring multiple freestyle skills together into a
coordinated effort for the most productive freestyle.

The 100 BestSwimming Drills
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: A lifeguard swimming to a person in trouble approaches the
victim using a modified head up freestyle to keep his or her eyes on
the victim and get there as quickly as possible. Likewise, a
designated sprinter for a waterpolo team races to gain control of the
ball, using modified head up freestyle to watch the ball to be
captured. Try Heads Up Freestyle. Focus your eyes on a point at the
far end of the pool and get there as fast as you can.
Step 2: Stroke quickly, keeping your chin low in the water, and your
eyes focused forward. Keep your head up the whole time. Notice
that to keep your head up, when your hand enters in front, you must
engage the water immediately with your fingertips, palm and
forearm, and stroke continuously. Your stroke becomes shorter, and
your recovery becomes wider. Notice too that while it is possible to
keep your head up by pressing down on the water with your hands,
you limit your forward motion by doing so.
Step 3: Continue swimming head up, engaging the water
immediately with each stroke. Keep your elbows high. Accelerate to
the back with each short, quick stroke. Notice that by pressing back
on the water to go forward, your head stays above the water without
pushing down. Grab hold of the water aggressively and move closer
to your target with each stroke.
Step 4: With your head up, your body position is not ideal in the
water. To manage this “uphill” swimming position, stabilize your core
and kick actively, coordinating your kick to your arm stroke.
Although the rate of the kick is quicker than the rate of the arm
stroke, one kick should match each arm entry. As one arm enters in
front, kick down with one foot. Notice that by coordinating the
rhythm of your kick to
the arm entry, your kick
also matches the finish
of the stroke by the other
arm. Doing so creates
additional forward motion,
but also lift and balance
to the whole stroke.

Step 5: Continue toward your target. Notice that even from this
disadvantageous swimming position, you can move forward well
when all the parts of the stroke are coordinated and working
together. Rest, then try it again.
Step 6: Now try swimming regular freestyle with your face in the
water. Use the same quick stroke rate as you did in the Heads Up
drill. Press back on the water keeping your elbows high. Match the
downbeat of your kick
to the point when your
hand first takes hold of

Horizontal Rope Climbing
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Utilizing the largest muscles possible
• Moving past your anchored hand
• Feeling efficient forward motion
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Think about how a person climbs a rope. Hand over hand,
the climber uses one hand to grasp the rope at a point higher than
the body, while the other hand holds the body steady at the
previous advance. When the reaching hand has a good grip on the
rope, the climber moves his or her body past that reaching hand,
while the lower hand then becomes the one that reaches to a higher
point. This is exactly how the best swimming is. Rather than
churning the water madly, efficient swimmers reach and grab hold of
the water in front of them, then move their bodies beyond that
point, hand over hand.
Step 2: String a rope from one end of the pool to the other. Use the
lane line hooks at each end of the pool to secure your rope, but
allow slack so that most of the rope floats about one foot under the
surface. Avoid using lane lines for this drill. They can snap without
warning, and are very expensive to replace.
Step 3: Once your
rope is in place, take
a big breath and float
face down in the
water over the rope.

past the reaching hand, until your arm is straight and at your hip. At
the same time, use the other hand to reach to a father point.
Continue, arm over arm, moving your body farther along the rope.
When you have to breathe, lift your face out of the water gently,
then return to your face down position.
Step 4: Continue to the far end of the pool. Feel your body advance
through the water past your reaching hand. Practice several times.
Then try regular freestyle, without the rope. Take hold of the water,
then move yourself past that point with each stroke. Climb through
the water. This is the essence of efficient swimming.

Freestyle with Dolphin
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Coordinating the kick and the arm stroke
• Setting the stroke rhythm to the kick
• Using the momentum of the kick to benefit the arm stroke
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall preparing to do freestyle, arms extended,
core engaged. Do six to twelve good dolphin kicks. Focus on
producing a rhythmic kick with a compact, yet powerful downbeat,
while your feet stay connected to the water. For this drill, it is
important to keep your head stable, and not bouncing a lot.
Step 2: Once you have established a strong, rhythmic kick, begin a
freestyle arm stroke. Time your kick so you are producing one kick for
each single arm stroke. Note: this is different than butterfly stroke
rhythm. Once you have matched a kick to each arm stroke, time the
downbeat of each kick to happen at
precisely the moment that your hand
strikes the water in front.
Step 3: Continue to the other end of
the pool, focusing on coordinating
these two actions. Rest and repeat
until the freestyle arms and dolphin
kick are well coordinated with a
sustainable rhythm. Notice that when
the downbeat of your dolphin kick is
timed to the entry of your hand in
front, that you reach forward with
more momentum, encouraging you to
extend farther for longer. Notice too,
that although you are focusing timing
your kick to the reaching arm, that
the same kick is also assisting the
stroking arm, assisting you in

Step 4: Repeat the drill.

your kick. Match your
arm stroke to that

your feet in the water to

Step 5: Now try the same coordination using a flutter kick. While it
is common to use more than one flutter kick per arm, make sure that
one of your kicks matches the entry of your hand, and
simultaneously assists the fast finish of the other hand, for every
stroke that you take. Practice for several lengths of the pool.

Step 3: Continue to practice breathing every
third stroke for several lengths of the pool. One
side may seem more natural to you than the
other, just like one hand seems more natural
when writing. Keep practicing trying to make
your less natural side a mirror image of your
natural side.
Step 4: Once you are comfortable with this
timing, focus on your hip roll. Notice that with
bilateral breathing, it is more even on both
sides than when you breathe on just one side.
Notice too, that your kick has fewer pauses in
it, and it is more compact, especially during
breathing. Finally, notice that your arm stroke is
more symmetrical in depth, width and length
with bilateral breathing.
Step 5: Practice for several lengths of the pool.
Develop a balanced stroke by breathing on both
sides.

Backstroke
BODY POSITION DRILLS
Learning to float well on the back is the first step in being
comfortable with the backstroke. Good spinal alignment and core
tension not only improve comfort on the back, but can also
contribute to an effective backstroke. The goal of the following drills
for body position in backstroke is to experience positive backstroke
floatation upon which a good backstroke can be built.

Float on Spine
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Achieving an advantageous backstroke floating position
• Feeling effective core tension and stability
• Being comfortable on the back
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL

without attempting any
forward motion, arms at
sides, head leading.

Step 3: Resume your horizontal position in the water, face up. Focus
on your spine. Now, arch your back, so your belly button is the
highest point of your body. Try to get it above the water. Notice that
by doing so your face submerges, or nearly submerges in the water.
Your legs may also sink.
Step 4: Again lay horizontally in the water, face up. Focus on your
spine. Make it as absolutely straight as possible. This includes
straightening the natural bends in the small of the back and at the
neck. To accomplish this, rotate your pelvis forward, and press the
back of your head into the water. Notice that in doing so, you
contract your abdominal muscles, and actually relax your neck.
Notice too that your body floats more horizontally. This is the
advantageous floating position which you can build a good
backstroke stroke upon.
Step 5: Practice several times until you achieve the feeling of
balancing on your spine.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Finding correct head alignment

Step 2: Now move your chin toward your chest until the surface of
the water, or the “water-line” is just below your ear lobes. Notice
that in this position, the muscles in your neck and shoulders are
fully engaged. Your legs may also sink, and it will probably be
difficult to maintain your floatation.
Step 3: Now lay horizontally in the water, face up, spine straight. Lift
your chin and rock your head back, until your ears are completely
submerged and you can see the water at the back of your head. The
waterline will be at your eye brows and around your throat. Notice
that in this position, the muscles in the back of your neck and upper
back are engaged. Your float will probably not suffer, although you
will feel probably quite stiff.
Step 4: Again lay horizontally in the water, face up, spine straight.
Hold your chin neutral,

Twelve Kick Switch Backstroke
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Maintaining a straight spine while moving
• Beginning to feel leverage from the core
• Identifying the longest backstroke position
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Lay on your side in the water, with the arm closest to the
surface at your side, and the arm closest to the bottom of the pool
extended over your head. Achieve a straight spine, and good water-
line.
Step 2: Begin a gentle but continuous flutter kick, which should also
be directed side to side.
Step 3: Although your body is floating on its side, allow your face to
float straight up, so it is completely out of the water. Relax your neck
so your head feels like an independent object floating in front of
your body. In this position, the shoulder of the arm at your side
should be out of the water and closer to your cheek than your other
arm is to the other cheek.
Step 4: Kick twelve times (each leg equals one kick).
Step 5: Just as you finish the last kick, bring the arm laying by your
side straight over the water to an extended position over your head,
and at the same time,
bring the forward
reaching arm through
the water to your
side, as you switch to

KICK DRILLS
An effective flutter kick is a significant part of an efficient backstroke.
Although similar in its alternating motion to the flutter kick of
freestyle, there are certain distinctions. Kicking well on the back
requires employing leg muscles differently than humans commonly
do for most land activities. The major force of the backstroke kick is
upward, against gravity, making quick, compact kicking and good
foot position extremely important. The goal of the following
backstroke kicking drills is to address the unique issues of the
backstroke kick that contribute to an effective and sustainable
kicking technique.
22229999
Boiling Water Drill
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Learning to kick upward with force
• Feeling the water with your feet
• Developing a centralized kick
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Stand in the water a bit more than waist deep. Hold one
arm outstretched in front of you about twelve inches over the
surface of the water. Now, drop your hand down with force into the
water. Notice that the splash that occurs goes in all directions.
Notice too the sound that your hand makes as it makes a hole in the
water.
Step 2: Now, hold your arm outstretched about twelve inches under
the surface of the water. Raise your hand up with force to about
three inches under the surface of the water. Notice the water welling
up, almost like water coming to a boil. Repeat this action, with more
force, as if bringing the water to a full boil, without your hand ever
reaching the surface of the water. This is what your feet do in a good
backstroke kick.

Step 3:Try the same thing with your feet. Standing with your back
supported at the side of the pool, bring your foot about twelve
inches over the surface of the water and drop it down into the water.
Notice the large splash. Listen to the distinct sound of your foot
making a hole in the water. Now hold your foot twelve inches under
the water, toes pointed, and force your foot up towards the surface,
but don’t allow any part of your foot to break the surface of the
water. Make the water boil. Notice the feeling of the water against
the top of your foot.
Step 4: Now lay horizontally in the water, face up, straight spine and
good water-line, arms at your sides, toes pointed. Drop the heel of
your right foot down about twelve inches into the water. Force it up
quickly and create a visible boil. Try it with your left foot. Now try it

you are lifting your
knees, or doing a
bicycling motion during your kick. This is common because the
muscles used to lift the knees, the abductors, that connect the legs
to the abdomen, are used a great deal by humans on land in actions
such as walking, running, cycling and climbing stairs. However, in the
backstroke kick, lifting your knees weakens your kick.

Step 3: To engage the correct backstroke kicking muscles, the quads
and the hamstrings, resume your backstroke float, hands leading,
spine straight, good water-line, squeezing your ears with your
elbows, and begin kicking with absolutely no bend at the hips. It
means you have to start the kick lower than the surface of the water,
and use your leg as if to kick a ball floating on the surface of the
water. Although your knee will bend, it is only as a result of your
dropping your heel into the water, not by lifting your knee. Imagine
kicking a ball with your foot by raising your knee. It wouldn’t work.
Using your peripheral vision, check your knees. There should be no
water moving around them. Practice for several lengths of the pool.
Step 4: Now, double check if you are lifting your knees by holding a
kickboard with one hand, positioning it the long way over your
upper legs and knees as you float and kick, keeping the other arm
extended over your head. As you kick, you will be able to feel if your
knees bump the kickboard. Practice for several lengths of the pool.

Quarter Roll with Cup on Forehead
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Developing a balanced, effective kick
• Understanding the changing orientation of the kick
• Maintaining a stable head position while kicking
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Fill a medium plastic cup halfway with water. Gently balance
the cup on your forehead as you lay on your back in the water, with
a straight spine and good water-line. Once the cup is balanced,
position both arms at your sides. Begin kicking, toes pointed, knees
underwater, making the water boil. Continue kicking to the other end
of the pool, trying to keep the cup of water balanced on your
forehead. If it falls off, stand and start again. Practice until you can
kick productively without the cup falling off for a full length of the
pool.
Step 2: Now prepare to
kick another length with
the cup on your forehead.
This time, every six kicks,
do a quarter roll. Keeping
your head still so the cup
remains balanced, roll your
body clockwise, so that
your left shoulder, arm and
hip are out of the water,
while your right shoulder,
arm and hip are low in the
water. Your kick should

your left shoulder, arm and
hip are low in the water. After
six kicks, roll back to the flat
back floating position, kicking

Step 4: Continue kicking with quarter rolls to the end of the pool,
with your head still so that the cup remains balanced on your
forehead. If the cup falls off, start again. This is not an easy drill!
Practice until you can kick productively, with quarter rolls, while the

ARM STROKE DRILLS
Of the many misconceptions about the backstroke arm stroke, the
most common is that the arms remain straight throughout the
stroke, like a windmill. A straight arm stroke is often associated
with shoulder problems. It is also difficult, like trying to lift yourself
out of the pool with straight arms. While it is important to begin
and finish the stroke with straight, well aligned arms, using a high
and firm bent elbow position, during the middle of the stroke,
allows the swimmer to access more power, and move forward with
an accelerating pull then push action. The goal of the following
arm stroke drills for backstroke is to learn the most productive
path of the underwater stroke for an easier, more effective,
shoulder-saving stroke.
33333333
One Arm Pull/Push
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Learning the path of the backstroke arms
• Feeling both pull and push
• Rolling into and out of each stroke
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Float in the water, face up, spine straight, good water-line,
kicking productively, with one arm at your side and the other
extended over your head, aligned with the shoulder.
Step 2: Start your stroke by descending your reaching hand about
twelve inches straight down into the water, pinkie finger first,
allowing the opposite shoulder and hip to rise at the same time.
From twelve inches deep, keeping your elbow absolutely still, begin
to move your fingertips and palm upward to press the water toward
your feet. Sweep your hand to the height of your shoulder, so that
your arm is close to a right angle. Done correctly, it should feel like
your forearm is rotating around your elbow. This is the pull portion
of the backstroke arms.

in this sweep. At the
same time, roll your
same side hip upward to assist in the power of this action. This is
the push portion of the backstroke arms.
Step 4: Recover your arm over the water and repeat the path of the
backstroke arm with the same arm. Notice that your hand is tracing a
sort of “S” shape along the side of your body. The top curve is the
pull, the bottom curve is the push. This “S” shape can become more
pronounced as you increase your roll into the top curve with your
shoulder and hip, and out of the bottom curve with your shoulder
and hip. Continue to the end of the pool.
Step 5: Repeat the drill, quickening your tempo, and accelerating
your hand toward your hip. Hold your elbow firm. Roll in and roll out
of each stroke. Try to identify the transition between pull and push.
Continue for several lengths, then switch arms.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Feeling the path of the backstroke arms
• Maintaining a stable elbow position
• Catching deep water
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall for the backstroke, both arms extended
over your head. Achieve a straight spine, firm core and good water-
line. Establish a productive kick. Begin the backstroke arm stroke
with your right arm, leaving your left arm in the extended position.
Step 2: Lower your right hand about twelve inches down into the
water by rolling the same side shoulder and hip down, and the
opposite shoulder and hip up. As your hand reaches its deepest
point, catch a handful of water. Maintaining a stable elbow position,
move your handful of water in an arch up and over your elbow.
Step 3: At the highest point in the arch, your fingers should be
pointing upward toward the surface of the water, but not breaking
the surface. At the finish of the arch, your arm should be straight
along the side of your body, and your fingertips should be pointing
toward your feet.
Step 4: As your right arm exits the water by your hip and returns
over the water to its starting position, trace the same path with your
left arm. Roll your left hip and shoulder down into the water, causing
your left hand to come
to a depth of about
twelve inches. Grab

THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Learning to feel the water with the forearm
• Using a stable, high elbow
• Appreciating the role of the hand
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall for the backstroke. Before the first stroke,
form closed fists with each hand.
Step 2: Start to stroke. At first it may seem impossible to make
forward progress without the paddle of your open hand. Keep
stroking, purposely positioning your arm so your forearm works as
your paddle to press against the water. This will require you to
initiate the stroke by moving your fists without moving your
elbows, and to keep your elbows high and stable as your fist moves
past them.
Step 3: Use the whole length of the stroke, top to bottom. Feel pull
and push. Accelerate the underwater stroke. Maintain opposition.
Adapt your stroke to the handless paddle. Continue to the other end
of the pool.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Achieving depth to begin the stroke
• Feeling the roll that begins the arm stroke
• Using a bent arm mid-pull similar to freestyle
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall for the backstroke with your arms extended.
Achieve a straight spine and good water-line. Kick productively.
Step 2: Take one stroke with your left arm. As your left arm reaches
your side, begin to stroke with your right arm while your left arm
starts its recovery over the water.
Step 3: When your right arm approaches mid-recovery, your left arm
should have come to
its deepest point under-
water. The shoulder and
hip of your recovering
arm should be at least
partially out of the water,
and the shoulder and hip
of your stroking arm
should be low in the
water.
Step 4: At this point,
redirect your recovery to
cross over toward your
opposite shoulder, and

RECOVERY DRILLS
The opposition timing of the backstroke makes the arm stroke
recovery an active part of the stroke. While resting the muscles of the
arm, the recovering arm must serve as a counterbalance to the
stroking arm. Accomplishing this requires the recovering arm to be
aligned correctly itself in relation to the rest of the body. The
following backstroke recovery drills focus on developing a relaxed,
aligned and balanced path over the water.

Clock Arms
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Using an aligned entry position
• Learning to avoid over-reaching
• Feeling the natural range of motion of the shoulder
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Stand in front of a full-length mirror. Imagine the face of a
large clock centered on the mirror in front of you. Raise your right
arm over your head as if preparing to enter the water for the
backstroke, pinkie first. Position your hand at 12:00. Now, attempt to
lower your arm downward as you would into the water to a point
about twelve inches below where the water’s surface would be.
Notice that from the 12:00 position, your shoulder does not allow
this rotation, unless you are double-jointed.
Step 2: Again, raise your right arm over your head extended as if
preparing to enter the water for the backstroke. This time, position
your arm at 1:00, and attempt to lower your arm as you would into the
water to a point about twelve inches below where the water’s surface
would be. Notice that your shoulder allows this rotation, moving more
freely around the joint. Some swimmers may need to use a 1:30 or
2:00 for a more comfortable entry point.
Step 3: Once you have found an entry point that allows free
shoulder joint rotation, try duplicating this entry point with the other

Two-step Recovery
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Establishing the path of the recovery
• Feeling correct recovery alignment
• Avoiding an over-reaching entry
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall preparing to do the backstroke, both
arms extended over your head, straight spine, good water-line,
productive kick.
Step 2: Take one stroke,
leaving the other arm
extended. When your arm
finishes the underwater
phase of the stroke past
your hip, slide it straight
out of the water, up-
ward past the side of
your body. Establish the
path of your recovery by
tracing a half-circle in
the air, from the place
where your arm exited
the water to the point it
will enter, extended past
your shoulder, aligned in
the direction you are
heading. Repeat with the
other arm, focusing on
the forward-aimed, arched
path of the recovering
arm.

trace the arch over the water, but stop your arm at the highest point
in the arch and count to five. Notice the alignment to your higher
arm. It should be directly above your shoulder, pointing to the sky,
not above your face. A misaligned recovery leads to an over-reaching
entry that starts the stroke from a position of weakness.
Step 4: After the count of five, lower your arm back into the water,
following the same recovery path in reverse, finishing with your hand
past your hip. Count to five, and begin recovery again, this time
tracing the whole recovery path and entering the water extended
past your shoulder. Check your alignment at the high point as your
arm passes. As your arm begins this second, full recovery, the
extended arm begins its underwater stroke.
Step 5: When the second arm completes the underwater stroke,
again do a half recovery, then the complete recover. Continue to the
far end of the pool, alternating arms with a two-step recovery.
Practice for several lengths until the path of the recovery is well
aligned with your shoulder at the top of the arch, and not over-
reaching to the center at entry.

Step 3: Again extend your chalk
arm, but as you approach the
entry position, push your elbow
to the locked position, as if you
would if trying to reach something
on a shelf that is a bit too high.
Make another mark on the wall,

elbow, the second mark aligns Locked Elbow Bent Elbow
above your shoulder, where as
the first mark aligns more closely with your head. In addition, many
swimmers will notice that simply locking their elbow, the second
mark will be higher on the wall by several inches, indicating a longer
stroke. Try it with the other arm.
Step 5: Now, get in the water and push off the wall for the
backstroke, arms extended over your head, spine straight, good
water-line, and productive kick. Take one underwater stroke ending
past your hip. Begin your recovery focusing on your elbow. Look for
any bend in your recovering arm at any point during the arching path
over the water. Swim backstroke to the far end of the pool, watching
each recovery, and checking for any bend in your elbow.
Step 6: Again swim regular backstroke. As each stroke ends past
your hip, deliberately push your elbow to the locked position before
starting the recovery. Maintain your locked elbow throughout the
recovery. Notice that your stroke will feel longer. Notice too that your
locked elbow recovering arm will feel more connected to the
underwater arm, as it creates an opposition balance while they move
in conjunction. Notice as well that you will be able to feel the water
better as your recovery arm transitions to the stroking arm.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Feeling an outward hand pitch
• Maintaining a firm arm and a relaxed hand
• Avoiding a collapsed wrist at entry
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall for the backstroke. Achieve a straight
spine, good water-line, opposition balance, and locked recovering
elbow. Kick productively. Stroke through and recover. After recovery,
your hand should enter the water pinkie first, slicing the water,
rather than making a hole in it with your flat hand. This requires
positioning your hand with the palm facing outward. Try the palms
out entry for several strokes.
Step 2: Now, swim backstroke again, maintaining a palms-out entry
position at the end of recovery. Freeze in the position when your arm
has passed the top of the recovery arch. Observe which way your
fingers are pointing. If they are pointing inward toward your face,
and you are seeing the back of your hand, you have a collapsed
wrist. A collapsed wrist positions your palms upward, as if you were
a waiter holding a tray over your shoulder. It is the weakest entry

position possible, and a disruption in your alignment. Notice that
with a collapsed wrist, the muscles in your forearms are working,
rather than resting during recovery. Notice too, that with a collapsed
wrist, it is much harder to maintain a locked elbow recovery.
Continue swimming, avoiding a collapsed wrist.
Step 3: Now, with your locked elbow, palms-out recovering arm,
deliberately allow that hand to flop to the outside at the wrist,
relaxing your fingers as you do. This is the Dog-ears position. Notice
that your forearm becomes more relaxed simply by changing your
wrist position. Notice too that with your hand in an outwardly
pitched position, when your hand lowers into the water, it is
positioned perfectly to grab a handful of water.
Step 4: Continue swimming backstroke with a dog-eared recovery.
Increase your stroke rate. Grab a handful of water with each entry,
hold on to it, and move your body past your hand.

BREATHING DRILLS
Without your face in the water, it would seem that breathing drills
for backstroke are a low priority. The opposite is true. Because
rhythmic breathing is an essential part of sustaining any swimming
stroke, learning to develop a good breathing rhythm in the
backstroke is a top priority. In addition, because the power of the
backstroke kick is upward, against gravity, frequent oxygen exchange
is required. Many swimmers dislike backstroke because water gets in
their face. Learning to time the breathing to the rhythm of the waves
of the stroke, makes the backstroke much more enjoyable. The goal
of the following backstroke breathing drills is to develop rhythmic
breathing and more a comfortable, productive backstroke.

Rhythmic Breathing Sequence
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Experimenting with different breathing rhythms
• Matching the stroke rate and the breathing rhythm
• Becoming comfortable breathing in the backstroke
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Stand with your hand on your abdomen, between your
breastbone and your belly button. Close your eyes and breathe
normally. Feel the rhythm of your breathing as you inhale and
exhale. Now, maintaining the same rhythm, breathe as if you were in
the water, inhaling through your mouth and exhaling through both
nose and mouth.

haling on one arm, and exhaling on the other. Notice, that with a
quicker stroke rate, this breathing rhythm doesn’t work as well.
There is not time to fully inhale or exhale. Change your breathing
rhythm to inhale with one full stroke cycle (one stroke with each
arm), and then exhale on the next stroke cycle. Notice that your
breathing rhythm more closely resembles your “normal” breathing
rhythm using this timing. Continue for several lengths of the pool,
resting after each length.
Step 4: Now, try a stroke rate that is very relaxed and easy, perhaps
resembling warm-up speed. Inhale with one stroke cycle, exhale with
the next. Notice, that at this slower stroke rate, this breathing
rhythm doesn’t work as well. The exchange of air is not frequent
enough. Change your breathing rhythm so you are both inhaling and
exhaling with each arm recovery, doing the same thing on the next
arm. Notice that the breathing rhythm is now more normal. Continue
for several lengths of the pool, resting after each length.

is in mid-recovery. At this
point, the armpit of your
recovering arm should be
completely out of the
water, and the shoulder
of the other arm should
be at its lowest point
under the water. Figure 42 The Breathing Pocket
Step 2: Observe that in this position and point in the stroke, the
raised armpit side forms a barrier to the water that would otherwise
be in your face. Resume stroking. Notice that this barrier is only in
place for a very brief moment. This is your breathing pocket. It is
your chance to inhale without water going in your face.
Step 3: Swim backstroke again, exaggerating your roll to make the
breathing pocket very clear. Try to find the breathing pocket on each
side of your body. Continue swimming backstroke inhaling in your
breathing pocket with each stroke.

LEVERAGE DRILLS
Leverage in the backstroke adds potential power to the stroke,
increases the range of motion at the beginning of the stroke, and
enables the swimmer to sustain the stroke longer. It is achieved
similar to freestyle, through the side to side rolling action of a
unified core. The goal of the following leverage drills for backstroke
is to learn to incorporate a productive roll into the stroke.

six good kicks in this position (one leg = one kick).
Step 2: With your sixth kick switch floating sides, by rolling toward
the other hip and shoulder, but remaining face up. This roll should
initiate three more strokes by bringing the high hip and shoulder
down, and the low hip and shoulder up, while the arm at your side
recovers over the water to the front, and the reaching arm begins its
underwater stroke. Keep a steady kick through the whole process.
Step 3: Continue doing three strokes, kicking the whole time, and
then six kicks in the side position until you reach the far end of the
pool. Notice that your “switch” affects both arms at the same time.

Step 4: Repeat the drill, this time using three strokes and three
kicks. As you become more comfortable, try to incorporate the
switch between each stroke. Continue to the far end of the pool.
Step 5: Once you are able to roll productively with each stroke,
begin swimming regular backstroke rolling into and out of each
stroke, as you did in the drill. Practice for several length of the pool.

One Arm Rope Climb
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Learning to anchor your reaching arm
• Feeling the high elbow position of strength
• Experiencing your body moving past your hand
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: String a rope from one end of the pool to the other,
attaching it securely to the lane rope hooks in the side of the pool.
The rope should be fairly tight, floating just below the surface of
the water.
Step 2: Lay in the water on your back, one arm extended over your
head, spine straight, good water-line, the rope just outside your
extended arm. Grasp the rope with the hand of your extended arm.
From this anchor point, pull your body past your hand, with a totally
straight arm, moving your arm across the surface of the water, until
the hand holding the rope is by your hip. Notice that as you move
forward, no matter how much core stability you have, your legs
swing toward the rope. Notice as well, that your shoulder is doing
all the work.
Step 3: Grasp the rope again with your arm extended over your
head. This time, drop your elbow down, lowering it into your ribs as
you attempt to move your body past your anchored hand. Notice
that it is very difficult to move your body forward with your elbow
low and moving.
Step 4: Again, grasp
the rope with your
arm extended over
your head. This time,
pull your body up so
that your shoulder

up to a right angle, but remain about parallel to your shoulder and
hand. From this point, straighten your arm. Keep your elbow firm as
your body moves past your anchored hand. Notice that by keeping
your elbow firm you have more leverage to move yourself forward. It is
also easier and more productive than the other two ways that you tried.
Step 5: Continue the one arm rope climb using a high, stable elbow,
and an accelerating arm action. When you reach the far end of the
pool, switch arms. Practice several times with each arm. Once you
are able to clearly feel

Opposition Freeze Frame
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Understanding the role of opposition in backstroke leverage
• Checking opposition at various stages in the stroke
• Learning to maintain opposition
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall on your back, with both arms at your
sides. Kick productively. With your right arm, do one complete
backstroke, bringing your arm over the water in a fully aligned arch,
then stroking through to your hip. When your right arm returns to its
starting point, do the same thing with your left arm. Continue for
twelve strokes. Notice that the forward motion you produce is not
continuous, so that when your left arm is at your side and your right
arm is in the air recovering, nothing is moving you forward except
your kick. Notice too that it is difficult to roll into and out of your
stroke, accessing core leverage. This is an example of backstroke
without “opposition”.
Step 2: Now, push off the wall with both arms extended over your
head, preparing to do the backstroke, spine straight, good water-
line, productive kick, locked elbows, hands pitched out. Establish
opposition by doing an underwater stroke with one arm, while the
other remains over your head. Roll toward the side of your body with
the arm extended, so that side of your body becomes lower in the
water. Now, begin swimming backstroke, focusing on maintaining
opposition.
Step 3: Swim six strokes
at a good strong pace.
On the next stroke,
freeze when your right
hand has entered the
water. Notice where your
left hand is. It should be

Armpit Lift
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Balancing the recovery arm with the stroking arm
• Using core leverage
• Developing a unified stroke
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall preparing to do the backstroke, straight
spine, good water-line, productive kick. Establish opposition. Roll
into and out of each stroke.
Step 2: As your recovering arm approaches the top of the arch over
the water, lift your armpit out of the water by rolling your opposite
shoulder down lower into the
water. Keep your elbow locked,
and your hand aligned above your
shoulder. When your recovering
arm approaches the entry point
beyond your shoulder, allow your
armpit to submerge again.
Step 3: Recover with the other
arm. Notice that when you lift the
armpit at the top of the recovery
arch, it affects the underwater
stroking arm. Correctly balanced,
lifting your armpit helps your other
arm to transition from the pull
phase to the push phase of the
stroke, and, to produce important
arm speed at the finish of the
stroke.
Step 4: Continue stroking, and
with each recovery, lift your armpit
out of the water during the highest

COORDINATION DRILLS
Coordinated backstroke unifies the individual actions of the stroke
into a seamless effort forward. With each part working together, the
backstroke becomes easier, smoother, and more comfortable, as
well as more productive. The goal of the following coordination
drills is to bring together the many elements that contribute to a
good backstroke and to use them in combination for efficient
backstroke action.

HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall on your back, both arms extended,
preparing to do the backstroke, straight spine, good water-line,
productive kick. Swim to the other end of the pool focusing on
identifying the pull phase and the push phase in your backstroke
arm stroke.
Step 2: Swim another length of backstroke, this time focusing on
identifying the roll or “switch” from one side of your body to the
other.
Step 3: Now, swim a length of backstroke timing the pull phase of
the underwater arm stroke to begin as you “switch” toward the
underwater arm. Then, with the same arm, time the push phase of
the stroke to begin as you “switch” away from the underwater arm.
Step 4: Swim several lengths of the pool, focusing on the timing of
roll, pull, roll push. Concentrate on one arm at a time. Once
coordinated with the first arm, concentrate on the other arm to see if
your timing also follows roll, pull, roll push.
Step 5: Practice until you can increase your stroke rate and still
maintain this timing. This is the ideal backstroke coordination.

Pinkie Lead
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Using the hip roll to initiate the recovery
• Eliminating extraneous actions
• Learning to avoid shoulder pain
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall on your back, both arms extended,
preparing to do the backstroke, straight spine, good water-line,
productive kick. Swim backstroke to the other end of the pool
focusing on your hand at the end of the push phase of the arm
stroke, just before recovery. Notice that your thumb is closest to your
body as it finishes the push, and the pinkie is to the outside. In this
position it is the back of the hand that exits first for recovery,
creating a large hole in the water, and lifting heavy water upward
into the recovery.
Step 2:To avoid this, traditionally, most swimmers have been taught
to flip their hand to a thumb up position to exit the water, then
flip their hand again during recovery to achieve a pinkie first
entry at the end of recovery. Although the thumb-lead position
avoids more drag than exiting with the back of your hand, it requires
the additional action of flipping your hand over and then back
again. This action is done independently from the roll, making the
arm work harder. In addition, if not done early enough in the
recovery, the second hand flip can contribute to shoulder pain.
Practice the thumb-first recovery, initiating the flip to pinkie leading
before your hand reaches
the top of the recovery
arch.
Step 3: The alternative
to flipping your hand,
before and again during
recovery, is to allow your
roll to position your hand

stroke to the other end of the pool, feeling core stability that unites
your shoulders and hips. Focus on your shoulder of the arm that is
finishing the push phase of the underwater stroke. As the hand
finishes the push, deliberately pop the same side shoulder out of
the water just as your hand passes your hip. Notice that as you do
this deliberate movement with your shoulder, your same hip will also
rise. Practice to the far end of the pool.
Step 4: Now, swim another length of backstroke, focusing on
popping your shoulder out of the water, and allowing your same side
hip to rise at the point when your same side your hand is finishing
the push. Freeze in that position. Observe that having rolled, it is the
pinkie that is positioned to exit the water first for recovery. With the
pinkie leading the recovery from start to finish, there is no need to
flip the hand over and back, or to make sure the second flip is done
early in the recovery to avoid shoulder pain.
Step 5: Repeat this drill,
maintaining unified hip
and shoulder action. With
each stroke, deliberately

one arm is under the water, one arm is over the water. When one
arm is in mid-stroke under the water, the other arm is in mid-
recovery.

pushing past the hip. Both arms are in the water at the same time.
Both are in the power phase of the stroke at the same time. For a
moment, the arms are actually not opposite.
Step 3:Continue swimming backstroke, feeling this moment of
overlap. Feel how the roll of the stroke assists both arms, one to
start the arm stroke, the other to finish the arm stroke. Use this
moment to start your stroke with power, and to finish your stroke
with power. Practice more until you can feel both arms engaged in
the power phase of the stroke at the same time, at opposite ends of
the stroke.

Breaststroke
BODY POSITION DRILLS
Because drag is an inherent part of the breaststroke, achieving
excellent body position is essential in maximizing the forward
motion of the stroke. Like freestyle and backstroke, the core is the
center of power, but in breaststroke, there is no side-to-side roll,
instead, there is a tipping or rocking type motion. Achieving an
effective rocking motion requires the swimmer to maintain a stable
hip position, while the head and legs switch back and forth between
the extremes of the tipping float. The goal of the following drills for
breaststroke body position is to learn to use core tension to achieve
the best floating technique, while minimizing drag and maximizing
glide productivity.

Streamline
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Eliminating drag
• Achieving an advantageous breaststroke glide position
• Feeling effective core tension and stability
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Position your feet wide apart on the wall and push off on
your front still with your legs apart, arms extended but with your
hands about thirty-six inches apart. You should be floating like an
“X”. With your face in the water, look forward. Float until you stop.
Notice the distance you travelled.
Step 2: Again push off the wall in the same “X” position, put this
time, lower your chin and look at the bottom of the pool. Float until
you stop. Notice that the distance you travelled is farther. Simply by
eliminating the frontal resistance of your face being forward, you
bump into less water, and move forward better.
Step 3: Now push off the wall, with your legs apart, looking at the
bottom of the pool, and this time clasp one hand over the other, and

straighten your elbows so you are squeezing your ears between your
arms. Your arms should be pointing forward, like an arrow. Float
until you stop. Notice that the distance you travelled is even farther.
By narrowing your leading edge, you bump into less water, moving
forward better.
Step 4: Now push off the wall, looking at the bottom of the pool,
clasping one hand over the other, with straight elbows, squeezing
your ears between your arms. This time position your legs closer for
the push off, then when you leave the wall hold them together, thigh
to ankle. Float until you stop. Notice that the distance you travelled
is much farther. By reducing the total space you take up, you bump
into less water, and move forward better.
Step 5: Now push off the wall, looking at the bottom of the pool,
clasping one hand over the other, with straight elbows, squeezing
your ears between your arms, legs together, thigh to ankle. Engage

Rocking Drill
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Using a rocking motion for breaststroke
• Developing unified core action
• Understanding the purpose of rocking
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Float face down in the water, arms at your sides. Engage
your core and straighten your spine. Achieve a “downhill” floating
position by pressing your chest down into the water about three
inches. Notice that your legs float higher. This resembles the body
position during the glide phase of the breaststroke. This is one
extreme of the rocking action of the stroke. Hold for five seconds.
Step 2: Now, release your chest press as you draw your heels back
toward your buttocks, bending at the knee. Keep your feet under the
water. Feel your floating position change. Notice that without raising
your chin, your head rises. Your knees should be the lowest point of
your float. This resembles the body position when you are
approaching the inhale and the power phase of the kick. It is the
other extreme of the breaststroke rocking motion. Hold for five
seconds.
Step 3: Next, try it with forward momentum. Push off the wall with
good force, face down, arms at your sides, core engaged,
spine straight. Achieve the
glide position immediately
by pressing your chest
down about three inches.
While you are still moving
forward, switch to breath-
ing position by releasing
your chest and drawing
your heels back. Notice
that your forward motion
slows right away.

Step 4: Again, push off the wall and press your chest down about
three inches. Then switch to the breathing position, but this time,
quickly shift again, so you are pressing your chest down in the
water, your legs are straight, and you regain your glide position.
Notice how you can overcome the slowing effect of the breathing
position by returning to the advantageous glide position quickly. Try
it again. Alternate floating chest down and chest up continuously for
several seconds while still moving forward.

Breaststroke
KICK DRILLS
Unlike other strokes, the kick in the breaststroke produces more
forward motion than the arm stroke. It also has a great deal of
potential drag. It is a unique kick that uses rounded, lateral and
completely splashless leg motion, where the soles of the feet push
the water rather than the tops of the feet as in other strokes. The
goal of the following breaststroke kicking drills is to experience
positioning and, using the hips, knees and feet most
advantageously, maximize forward motion, and minimize drag for the
most effective breaststroke kick.

Duck Feet
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Learning to use your feet as paddles
• Using ankle rotation to keep hold of the water
• Avoiding potential drag
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Observe a duck swimming in the water. Focus on its feet.
They are a perfect swimming feet! They are wide and flexible, and
very paddle-like. Looking closely at the kicking motion, although the
duck kicks with alternating legs, the actual kicking motion is very
similar to the breaststroke kick. Studying the motion of one foot, it
shows a good example of how the human foot should move in the
breaststroke kick. As the duck’s foot prepares for the power phase of
the kick, from front to back, it takes a flexed position, forming a
right angle to the ankle. During the rounded sweep-back of the
duck’s kick, notice how the angle of the foot steadily changes,
rotating from a flexed and pitched out starting position to a pointed,
inwardly pitched position at the end of the kick. This changing
foot position, produced by rotating the ankle, allows the duck to
maintain pressure on the water most effectively with its foot at all
stages of the kick, and create very effective forward motion.
155

--- Page 157 Text ---
SwimmingDrills 99-198 20.05.2011 16:11 Uhr Seite 156
The 100 BestSwimming Drills
Step 2: Now observe the foot of the duck as it returns to the
starting position for another kick. Notice that while the foot is
pointed, it appears as it is retracted, reducing the size of the
“paddle”. It also moves more slowly than during the power phase.
This is the recovery of the duck’s kick. The duck’s foot slides back to
the starting position without applying pressure on the water.
Step 3: Keeping the duck’s kicking technique in mind, get in the
water, at least waist deep, and stand facing the wall of the pool.
Hold onto the wall with both hands, arms extended. Draw one foot
up behind you, so your heel is close to your buttocks. It should be
completely submerged, and remain that way throughout the kick.
Flex your foot, creating a right angle at your ankle. Also pitch your
toes outward.
Step 4: From this position, press
the bottom of your foot against
the water. Notice the water
resistance on the bottom of your
foot when it is flexed. Trace a
rounded line with your foot,
outward and then inward, until
your leg is straight. Try it again
with more speed. In order keep
your foot pressing against the
water as it makes the rounded

buttocks, through the rounded sweep, until your leg is straight, then
try to mimic the duck’s foot recovery. As you bring your foot back up
to the starting point, position it so you feel little or no resistance.
Slide it through the water smoothly and with less speed. Once it
reaches the starting position, flex your foot again and pitch your
toes out preparing for another power phase. Practice this several
times. Then practice the whole kick, power phase and recovery.
Step 6: Once you are able to feel a difference in the resistance
between the power phase and the recovery, try doing the kick with
both legs simultaneously. Holding the wall with one arm extended,
place the other hand lower on the wall so you can brace yourself
easily in a horizontal position. Keep your feet submerged throughout
the kick. Your feet should move as mirror images to each other. Draw
both heels back toward your buttocks. Focus on using your feet like
paddles to engage the water throughout the power phase. Done
correctly, by the end of the kick, you should have to tense your arms
to prevent yourself from advancing toward the wall. Slide your feet
gently back to the starting point, so you don’t feel any pull away
from the wall. Practice the breaststroke kick several times.

Breaststroke Kick on Your Back
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Developing a propulsive kick
• Avoiding folding at the hips
• Positioning your knees inside your feet
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Lay on your back in the water, hands at your sides, and
slightly behind you, fingertips extended. Begin to kick breaststroke
kick on your back. Bring your heels back to the point that they touch
158

your fingertips. Then with your feet flexed and pointed outward, use
a quick motion to trace a rounded sweep with your feet, outward
then inward, maintaining water pressure on the soles of your feet
until your legs are straight. Repeat several times, drawing your heels
back slowly and smoothly, then engaging the water with the soles
of your feet and pressing firmly against the water until your legs
are straight.
Step 2: Now, continuing the same kicking action on your back, focus
on your knees. They should remain under the surface of the water as
your heels come back and touch your fingertips. If your knees are
coming out of the water, it means you are folding at the hips. For
many people, this causes a wave of water to wash over their face. If
you were swimming on your front doing a breaststroke kick folded at
the hips, that wave would work as drag, greatly slowing your
forward motion. Try again, maintaining a straight line from your
shoulders to your knees. Produce a knee bend by drawing your
heels back, rather than by folding at the hips.
Step 3: Still focusing on your knees, positioned under the surface of
the water in a straight line from shoulder to knee, position them
about shoulder width apart. As you draw your heels back to touch
your fingertips, hold the
position of your knees
steady. Notice that with
your knees held still,
your feet will be farther
apart than your knees

moving wider apart. Only at the very end of the kick, as your legs
straighten do your knees also move, coming together as the feet
also come together. Notice that with firm knees, your lower leg,
ankle and foot are rotating around your knees as they sweep out
and straighten. Practice again.
Step 5: Once you are able to achieve a kick without folding at the
hip, and you are able to maintain a stable knee position, try
kicking with more force. You should be able to produce enough
forward motion with each kick that you can glide in the straight leg
position for three to five seconds before slowing down. Practice
this several times.

Vertical Breaststroke Kick
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Developing a productive kick
• Using foot speed during the power phase
• Eliminating drag
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: In water, at least as deep as you are tall, get into a vertical
position. Begin a gentle sculling action (tracing side to side
underwater figure eights with your hands) to keep your head above
water.
Step 2: To begin the power phase of the breaststroke kick, draw
your heels back toward your buttocks. Use flexed feet, stable knees,
and kick in a path that your feet rotate around your knees, without
producing forward or backwards motion. Use a forceful and quick
enough kick so that you bob upward with each kick as your legs
straighten. Practice several times, with increasing foot speed.
Step 3: Practice several times. While preparing for the power phase
of the kick, avoid raising your knees toward your abdomen so that
you don’t pull yourself down underwater. Make sure your feet are in
the flexed position before beginning the power phase of the kick.
Step 4: Once you have achieved
a productive vertical kick, stop
the sculling action with your
hands. Position your hands: left
hand on right shoulder and right
hand on left shoulder. Kick,
keeping your head above water.
Maintain for 30 seconds.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Using your senses to recognize a productive kick
• Observing momentum
• Practicing an effective kick
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall in a streamlined position, arms extended,
clasping one hand over the other. Establish a stable hip position.
With your head up, allow your chin to rest on the surface of the
water. Begin kicking breaststroke kick, keeping your feet completely
submerged throughout each kick.
Step 2: Notice your movement. During the power phase of the kick,
you should be able to see your kick producing forward momentum.
During the recovery phase of the kick, you should notice no slowing,
or movement in the reverse direction. Feel your feet working like
paddles during the power phase, pressing on the water. Feel your
feet during the recovery,

ARM STROKE DRILLS
In an effort to overcome drag, and increase forward motion, the
breaststroke arm stroke has evolved immensely over time. While it
has remained a simultaneous stroke, many theories about what the
arms do have been developed. The arm stroke has been described
as a heart-shaped pull, a box-shaped pull, even a straight-arm circle,
half formed with each arm. It is now accepted that the legs are

arm stroke has evolved into a compact, lateral action, with its main
function being to balance the action of the kick, and to facilitate
breathing. The goal of the following arm stroke drills for breaststroke
is to learn to enhance the breaststroke balance and breathing using
a quick, compact arm stroke.

your hands are slightly outside your shoulders, forming a “Y”. Your
arms should be straight at this point in the stroke. This is the widest
point in the breaststroke arm stroke. From there, sweep your hands

breaststroke arm stroke. Sweep outward, then inward. Your hands
meet under your chin. This is the shortest point in the breaststroke
arm stroke. Practice to the far end of the pool, identifying the long
and the short points of the stroke.
Step 4: Continue swimming breaststroke for several lengths of the
pool, observing the three dimensional path of the stroke. Notice the

a sculling action with your hands, maintaining firm wrists. Your
hands should be tracing a mirror image of each other. Press the
water outward with the palms of your hands, positioning your
thumbs lower than your pinkies.
Step 2: After pressing outward just wider than your shoulders,
reverse your hand pitch so your thumbs are higher than your pinkies
and press the water inward with the palms of your hands.
Step 3: Before your hands meet, again switch the pitch of your
hands to thumbs-down and press outward. Produce a continuous
lateral sculling action for one minute. To breathe, press your chin
forward gently.
Step 4: Increase your
hand speed, maintaining

THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Learning to use compact strokes
• Using a quick stroke

HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall, preparing to do the breaststroke, arms
extended, face in the water. Do four arm strokes with your face in
the water, watching your hands as they sweep outward, then inward
through the path of the stroke. Return your arms to the fully
extended position between each stroke. Kick each time your arms
approach straight.
Step 2: Take a breath, then do four more strokes. Reduce the width
of your arm stroke until your hands stay within your field of vision
throughout the stroke. Still return your arms to the fully extended
position between each stroke. Notice that a stroke with less width
takes much less time to get your arms back to the extended start
position.
Step 3: After breathing, do four more strokes maintaining your
reduced arm stroke width. Now,
watch your hands as they sweep
from shallow to deep through
the path of the stroke. Again,
return your arms to the fully

Corners Drill
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Accelerating into the insweep
• Producing lift without pushing down
• Holding onto the water
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall for the breaststroke, arms extended. Press
your chest into the water, and use core tension and a straight spine
to achieve a “downhill” float. Begin the breaststroke arm stroke,
pressing outward with your thumbs low, then inward with your
thumbs high. Keep your hands within your range of vision.
Step 2: Do four or five quick strokes, holding on to the water
throughout the entire path of the stroke, especially during the
transition from outsweep to insweep. It is very important to maintain
firm wrists and high elbows during this transition. It should feel like
you are turning tight corners with each arm. It is important to feel
that you are doing so with your whole arms, not just your hands.
Upon arriving at these corners, gather speed for the insweep.
Increase your speed as you round the corners. At the end of each
insweep, when your hands come together in the middle, push
them straight ahead to the
extended position.
Step 3: Notice that with a quick
enough arm stroke, which
accelerates at the corners, you
feel the effects of lift, without
ever pushing down on the water.
Try it again. Increase the speed
of your stroke so that you

as you begin your quick insweep. Notice that if you maintain a firm
core, when your upper body rises, your feet will drop just a bit. Use
this opportunity, when your face is naturally at its highest out of the
water to get a breath. Then return your face to the water as your
hands approach the extended position. Press your chest downward.
Step 4: Continue practicing your quick lateral arm stroke,
accelerating at the corners to produce lift. Then, quickly return to the
“downhill” position. Spend half as much time in the breathing
position as in the glide position.

entire stroke within your
range of vision.
Step 2: Check for firm wrists and high elbows, especially at the
corners. Practice until you feel you are holding on to the water in
both directions. Start each new stroke from an extended arm
position.
Step 3: Still focusing on your hands, increase the rate of your arm
stroke. Pick up speed through the corners and into the insweep.
Practice until your arms are accelerating through the entire stroke.
Your stroke should be moving fast enough so that you can clap your
hands under your chin at the end of the insweep. Then, quickly
return your arms to the starting point, fully extended.
Step 4: Now focus on your quick flutter kick. Kick at a rate of at
least one down-beat per second. Try to accomplish an entire arm
stroke during three to four kicks. Watch your hands, checking that
you are maintaining a compact stroke, firm wrists and high elbows,
and accelerating into the insweep. When your hands return to the
extended position, hold them there for six kicks before trying to do
another complete arm stroke within the time of three to four kicks.
Step 5: Continue practicing to the far end of the pool. Focus on the
speed of your hands throughout each arm stroke, then return to the
extended position and hold. Start each arm stroke from this still
position, then attempt to go from zero to sixty within the time of
three or four kicks.

Breaststroke with Fists
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Learning to feel the water with the forearm
• Understanding the changing elbow position
• Appreciating the role of the hand
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall as if preparing to do the regular
breaststroke. Before the first stroke, form closed fists with each hand.
Step 2: Start the arm stroke. At first it
may seem impossible to make forward
progress without the paddles of your
open hands. Stroke quickly, purposely
positioning your arms so that the inside
of your forearms press against the
water throughout the arm stroke. This
will require you to initiate your stroke
with your arms extended, but elbows
rotated high, then to maintain firm
elbows while your fists sweep outward.
Step 3: Accelerate the stroke main-
taining high elbows as you turn the
corners with your fists. Keep the stroke
speed quick. Adapt your stroke to the
handless paddle. When your hands
approach the end of the insweep, then
allow your elbows to fold inward in
front of your rib cage, still pressing
against the water with your forearms.
Practice the change of elbow position
again, letting your elbows come inward,
but not back like chicken wings, and
only at the end of the insweep.

Breaststroke
RECOVERY DRILLS
Breaststroke is the only stroke with a recovery that passes through
the water rather than over it, leading to the potential for a great deal
of drag. To overcome this drag, the breaststroke recovery must be an
active part of the stroke, rather than a resting phase, as in other
strokes. The resting phase in the breaststroke comes after the
recovery, during the glide. Some swimmers have tried to avoid drag
by developing over-the-water recovery styles, with varying degrees of
success. For the most part, swimmers have chosen to overcome the
drag of the traditional in water recovery by increasing speed into,
and streamlining during and after the recovery. The goal of the
following breaststroke recovery drills is to minimize drag by
quickening the transition between arm stroke and recovery, and
developing a long, fast and compact recovery that works with the
line of the stroke.
66663333
Growing Your Recovery
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Achieving the longest recovery
• Using your elbows to extend recovery
• Using your chest to extend recovery
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Stand in waist deep water, facing the pool wall. Bow
forward so that your chin is on the surface the water. Look down and
forward, preparing to watch your breaststroke arm stroke and
recovery. Extend your arms in front of you so your fingertips touch
the wall. Your hands should be slightly submerged in the water. Now,
begin the arm stroke, compact, quick through the corners,
maintaining firm wrists throughout, and high elbows until the last
part of the insweep. When your hands finish the insweep, return
them to the extended position, fingertips touching the wall in front
of you.

The 100 BestSwimming Drills
Step 2: Take one step back – the length of your foot. Maintaining
your chin on the surface of the water, do another breaststroke arm
stroke, compact, quick through the corners, firm wrists throughout,
high elbows until the last part of the insweep. At the end of the
insweep, form a point with the fingertips of both hands, and drive
your hands and elbows forward with speed. As your hands reach
toward the wall, bring your forearms as close together as possible.
Your arms should form a long arrowhead, from hands to shoulders.
Notice that simply by straightening your arms more and creating
a narrow leading edge with your hands, forearms and elbows,
you have increased the length of your recovery, and are able to
touch the wall.
Step 3: Take another step back – the length of your foot. With your
chin still on the surface of the water, do another breaststroke arm
stroke, compact, quick at the corners, firm wrists, high elbows. At
the end of the insweep, with your fingertips together and pointed
forward, drive your hands and elbows forward with speed, narrowing
the space between your forearms as you reach. Before your hands
have reached full extension, drop your chest down and forward into
the water as you reach for the wall. Notice that using your chest in
the recovery action, you have increased the length of your recovery
even more, and are able to touch the wall.

Shoot to Streamline
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Learning to accelerate into the recovery
• Recovering with the rocking motion of the stroke
• Eliminating any pause between insweep and recovery
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall, preparing to do the breaststroke, your
arms extended fully in front of you, forming the point of an arrow
from your hands to your shoulders. Achieve a “downhill” floating
position. Begin a compact arm stroke, that is quick through the
corners.
Step 2: Maintain firm wrists throughout the stroke, and high elbows
until the last part of the insweep, when your elbows fold inward in
front of your rib cage. As your elbows fold in, notice that your hands
come together in a sort of praying position. This is the breaststroke
breathing position, a necessary but drag-producing point in the
stroke.
Step 3: Getting back to the “downhill” position quickly is crucial in
retaining your hard-earned forward momentum. To achieve this, the
recovery must continue the forward motion of the breaststroke,
avoiding any pause after the insweep. From the “praying position”,
shoot your hands and elbows forward at lightning speed, with your
forearms close together as you drop your chest and head down
forward. Kick when your arms are in mid-recovery. Glide for three to
five seconds in a fully streamlined position.
Step 4: Do another
stroke. Use a quick
outsweep, and a
quicker insweep.

stroke, then shooting your arms forward in the recovery. Notice that
the narrower your recovery is, the faster it cuts through the water.
Notice too, that by eliminating any pause in the “praying position”,
the recovering arms add to the forward momentum of the arm stroke.
Step 5: Continue practicing the narrowest recovery possible,
eliminating any stall between the insweep and the recovery. Keep
practicing until your arm stroke and recovery have become one
continuous, accelerating action. Catch the forward momentum of the
stroke and shoot to the streamline. Glide for three to five seconds
after each recovery.

stroke, sweeping out, then accelerate around the corners, and in
towards the middle to the “praying position” before recovery. This is
also the point in the stroke when you draw your heels up toward
your buttocks, preparing to start the power phase of your kick. In
this position, your head and chest should be higher than your hips.
You have a brief window of opportunity for breathing between the
corners and the praying position.
Step 2: As your elbows fold quickly inward to the “praying
position”, shrug your shoulders up. Then, as you transition to your
quick, narrow recovery, shrug your shoulders forward and down.
Notice that with this shoulder shrug, your upper body becomes more
involved in the recovery. Kick as your arms approach the streamlined
position. Glide and rest for three to five seconds.
Step 3: Do another stroke. Accelerate through the outsweep corners
and insweep. Fold your elbow in at the end of the insweep and shrug
your shoulders up, then forward and down into the recovery. Notice
that the shrug helps keep your momentum going through the
“praying position”, where a disadvantageous pause often occurs. As
you shoot your hands and forearms forward, and drop your chest
down and forward, notice too that your recovery carries more speed.
Kick as your arms approach

BREATHING DRILLS
The forward breathing style of the breaststroke makes the head
position a factor in maintaining the forward line of the stroke. In
addition, the timing of the breathing is crucial in reducing drag during
the power phase of the stroke. Incorrectly timed, the breathing can
break the forward motion of the stroke, but timed well, the breathing
action can actually improve it. The goal of the following breathing
drills is to learn the correct timing of the breaststroke breathing and to
unify the head and body into a single action that benefits the stroke.
66666666
Inhale at the High Point
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Learning the correct timing of the inhale
• Breathing with the line of the stroke
• Feeling lift
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall preparing to swim breaststroke, arms
extended. Achieve the “downhill” floating position. Begin your arm
stroke, sweeping out, maintaining firm wrists and high elbows. Hold
on to the water as you accelerate into the corners, maintaining a
firm spine all the way through your neck. As your hands round the
corners, preparing to sweep inward quickly, feel your body position
change, and your upper body rise. Notice that without raising your
chin, your mouth clears the water. Use this opportunity to inhale. As
you recover and kick, notice that you regain the “downhill” position,
and your face returns to the water.
Step 2: Do another stroke. Sweep your hands outward and into the
corners. As your hands change directions at the corners, feel the lift
produced for your head and upper body. Your breathing window
occurs when your mouth clears the water, through the high point in
the stroke, near the praying position. When you transition into the
recovery, and back to the “downhill” position, allow your face to
drop into the water with the rest of your upper body as you kick.

Tennis Ball Drill
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Maintaining a stable head position
• Breathing with the lift of the stroke
• Achieving lift by dropping the hips
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Place a tennis ball under your chin and hold it there,
maintaining a straight spine all the way up through your neck. This
will require you to adjust the position of the tennis ball out from
your throat, holding on to it with the point of your chin. Check in a
mirror to insure your spine-line is not compromised.
Step 2: Push off the wall preparing to swim breaststroke, holding
the tennis ball with your chin. Achieve the “downhill” floating
position, arms extended. In order to avoid dropping the tennis ball,
look at the bottom of the pool. Begin your arm stroke, sweeping
out, and accelerate into the corners. As your hands quickly round the
corners and you achieve lift, inhale without dropping the tennis ball.
Return your face to the water as you recover and kick. Exhale.
Step 3: Do another stroke. Accelerate your arm stroke to achieve lift.
Maintaining a firm hip position, draw your heels back toward your
buttocks, and breathe when your head is naturally at the highest
point in the stroke. Hold on to the tennis ball and inhale from the
corners through the praying
position. As you recover
and kick, press your chest
down, allowing your face to
return to the water without
dropping the tennis ball.

Breaststroke
LEVERAGE DRILLS
Improvements in breaststroke across the board, over the past twenty
years, are largely due to rule changes that allow better use of
leverage and the elimination of drag. By producing an integrated
rocking motion between the head and legs, with the hips as stable
as possible in the middle, the productivity of the arm stroke, kick
and glide is increased, and points of potential drag are minimized. A
good rocking motion does not have to be extreme to be effective, it
just has to be a unified body action, so each stroke action works as
a counterbalance to the others. Using a rocking motion allows the
swimmer to inhale when more water covers the feet. Using a rocking
motion allows the swimmer to transition to recovery more quickly,
avoiding drag. The purpose of the following drills for leverage in the
breaststroke is to learn to use a rocking motion to create better
leverage and less drag in the stroke.

Breaststroke with Dolphin
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Developing a productive rocking motion
• Maintaining a firm core
• Developing a rhythmic stroke
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall preparing to swim breaststroke, arms
extended, looking at the bottom of the pool. Maintaining a firm core,
do six good full-body dolphin kicks. Avoid over-bending at the knee,
and allow each kick to whip down from high in your body down to
your feet. As you move through the water, notice how the dolphin
action positions your body similar to the rocking motion of the
breaststroke.
Step 2: After six kicks, add the breaststroke arm stroke. Sweep out
toward the corners as you snap your feet downward. The combined
actions of your quick insweep and the downbeat of the dolphin

kinds of kick. Notice too that the rocking motion of the stroke works
the same with both kicks.
Step 4: Keep swimming breaststroke alternating dolphin and
breaststroke kick. On the stroke with breaststroke kick, there is one
arm stroke and one kick per stroke. On the stroke with dolphin kick,
there is one arm stroke to two kicks. Notice, though, that when
doing the stroke with the breaststroke kick, a dolphin-like down-
beat becomes apparent in the hips, as you transition to recovery.
Step 5: Keep practicing, allowing the rocking motion of the stroke to
transfer power through your body, with dolphin as well as with
breaststroke kick. Once you are producing good glide momentum with
both dolphin and breaststroke kick, alternate laps of the drill and
regular breaststroke. Feel the rocking motion transfer power to the rest
of the body like with the dolphin.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Feeling a productive rocking motion
• Maintaining the forward line of the stroke
• Avoiding flat breaststroke
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall preparing to swim breaststroke, arms
extended, looking at the bottom of the pool. Maintain a firm spine and
achieve a “downhill” floating position by pressing your chest downward.
Begin your arm stroke, sweeping out and into the corners. Allow your
chest to rise as you round the corners, and as you accelerate the
insweep, feel your face clear the water. Use this part of the stroke, from
the corners through the insweep to inhale as you move forward.
Step 2: As you transition to the recovery, your heels should be in a
position close to your buttocks preparing for the power phase of the
kick. When your hands pass your face during the recovery, kick with
force, and feel your head and upper body return to the water. Use
this power phase of the kick to achieve a productive glide. Hold for
three to five seconds.
Step 3: Do another stroke.

COORDINATION DRILLS
Of all four competitive strokes, breaststroke requires the most
precise coordination to overcome the inherent drag in the stroke, in
order to produce good forward motion. By correctly sequencing and
balancing the actions of the arm stroke, breathing, kick and glide,
each individual action of the stroke works better. The following drills
for breaststroke coordination focus on the inter-related actions of
the stroke, how they overlap, and work together to create an
effective stroke.
77772222
No Stars
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Using the most efficient breaststroke timing
• Avoiding drag
• Using the arm then the legs
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall for the breaststroke, arms extended. Look
at the bottom of the pool and achieve a straight spine. Notice how
well you move through the water in this narrow, streamlined
position.
Step 2: Begin to swim breaststroke to the far end of the pool. Use a
quick stroke tempo with both your arms and your legs. After several
strokes, freeze at the point in the stroke when your hands are at
their widest. Notice where your feet are. They should be at their
narrowest point.
Step 3: Continue swimming breaststroke, and resume your quick
stroke tempo. After several strokes, freeze at the point when your
feet are at their widest. Notice where your hands are. They should be
at their narrowest point.
Step 4: If your hands and feet are wide at the same time, this puts
you in the star position, the most disadvantageous way to move

through the water. The star position is achieved when your arms and
legs are in their power phase at the same time. In this position,
the arm and the leg action cancel each other out, and you produce
little or no forward motion. Swim breaststroke again, checking for
the star position.
Step 5: To avoid the star position, your kick must follow your arm
stroke with very little overlap. Begin the power phase of the legs
only when your arms are
well into the recovery. Try it.
Push off the wall for the
breaststroke. Sweep your

your mind. “Stroke” refers to the arm stroke, outsweep, corners and
insweep. “Breathe” refers to the inhale. “Kick” refers to the power
phase of the kick. “Glide” refers to the streamlined float that
maximizes the momentum of the stroke.
Step 2: Push off the wall, preparing to swim breaststroke, straight
spine, streamlined position. Say the steps in the sequence to
yourself again as you glide forward. Now perform the stroke actions
in slow motion, repeating the sequence of steps in your mind,
beginning each action when you say that step. Correctly timed, the
glide should take as long as the other three actions of the stroke
combined. Stroke, breathe, kick, gliiiiiiiiide.
Step 3: Do another stroke, again matching the start of each action
to the step as you say it to yourself. If you are following the stroke
sequence correctly, your arm stroke and inhale should be finished
before you begin the power phase of your kick. So, you could modify
the mantra to be “Stroke, breathe, then kick, gliiiiiide.

Thread the Needle
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Achieving coordinated forward motion
• Maximizing streamline and momentum
• Learning to rest during the glide instead of the recovery
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall preparing to do the breaststroke. Focus on
your body position while gliding forward. It should be long, narrow
and streamlined. Your head should be tight between your elbows,
and you should be looking at the bottom of the pool. Your legs
should be extended and together, toes pointed. This is the position
you should strive for with each glide. It is the position that makes
the smallest hole in the water. First made with your fingertips, it is
the same hole passed through by your forearms, elbows and head,
shoulders, chest, hips, legs and finally your feet.
Step 2: Begin to swim breaststroke, focusing on achieving a long,
narrow streamlined glide after each kick. Try to get back to the
streamlined position as quickly as possible after each stroke. Notice that
you don’t have to wait until you have fully achieved streamline to make
your small hole in the water. Begin as you recover, shooting your hands
forward to a long narrow point before your feet have finished kicking.
Step 3: Pretend the small hole that you pass through in your glide
position is right in front of you as you transition into recovery. Pretend
you have to pass through it like your were thread passing through

Step 4: Maintain a firm spine as you thread the needle through
recovery, achieving streamline the instant your feet come together
and through the eye of the needle at the end of the kick. Notice that
the recovery in breaststroke works best as an active part of the
stroke action, unlike in other strokes where a swimmer can use
recovery to rest. In breaststroke it is after the recovery, during the
streamlined glide that the swimmer has a moment to rest.
Step 5: Continue practicing, threading the needle with each stroke,
from the beginning of the recovery through to the end of the kick.

Butterfly
BODY POSITION DRILLS
The best butterfliers combine grace and power in what seems like
effortless forward motion. The primary point of technique that these
butterfliers share is good body position. While the line of the stroke is
characterized by a wave or rocking motion, it is a stable, high hip
floating position that is key to a good stroke. This position balances
the stroke, and integrates the actions of both the upper and lower
body. Often, swimmers attempt to achieve the rocking effect of the
butterfly by folding both forward and back at the hips. Doing so
eliminates core stability, lowers the hips, and eliminates balance in the
stroke. It can also lead to back pain. The goal of the following drills for
the butterfly body position is to develop a firm core, high hip body
position for better balance and integration of butterfly actions.

between the wall and your back. To achieve a truly firm core, you
must straighten your spine, and eliminate this space at the small of
your back. To do so, pull your belly button back toward your spine,
and press the small of your back into the wall. Notice that to do this,
you contract your abdominal muscles.
Step 2: Maintaining your spine straight with contracted abdominals,
press your chest forward away from the wall about six inches, as if
taking a bow. Keep your hips and lower body firmly against the wall,

Weight Shifting
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Feeling both natural and “downhill” body positions
• Learning to shift weight forward
• Developing effective core tension and stability
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Lay in the water, arms at your sides. Look at the bottom of
the pool. Feel your natural floating position. In butterfly, you have to
learn to actively change from your natural float to a “downhill”
position. You must learn to shift your weight forward so your chest is
lower than your hips, during every single stroke. To do this, you
must maintain a firm core and upper body, from your neck through
to your hips.
Step 2: Holding your core firm, press your chest down into the
water. Allow your chest to be lower than your hips. Feel your weight
shift forward. Now release your chest press and allow your body to
return to its natural float.
Step 3: Again press your chest down into the water, so you achieve
a “downhill” float. Maintaining your firm core, release your chest
press and return to your natural float. Repeat several times in a row,
maintaining a firm core in
both directions in a gentle,
rhythmic action. Notice that
as your press and release
your chest, your hips
remain stable in the water.
This is the essential

Step 4: Now push off the wall, with your arms extended over your
head. Feel your natural float, then, maintaining your firm core,
change it, shifting your weight forward by pressing your chest into
the water. Release and do it again, maintaining high hips.
Step 5: Repeat the upper body shift of weight several times, from
natural to “downhill” and back again. Feel the gentle wave produced
by alternating your floating position. Feel your hips remain stable.

KICK DRILLS
The butterfly uses the dolphin kick, where the legs move up and
down simultaneously resembling the action of a dolphin’s tail. In fact
it is more than a leg motion. It is an entire body motion. It is more
accurately called simply the dolphin. Done right it is one of the most
powerful movements in swimming. The dolphin uses a whip-like
motion that starts high in the body, and moves down through the
trunk, hips and legs, and ends up with the feet snapping down and
up again. The dolphin provides rhythm and balance to the other
actions of the stroke, but above all it adds power. A good dolphin

goal of the following kicking drills for butterfly is to develop an
effective, rhythmic and effective dolphin action that benefits the rest
of the stroke.

Ribbon Writing
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Understanding the fluid nature of the dolphin
• Generating power high in the body
• Learning to transfer power to the feet
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Cut a piece of wide ribbon to a length of about fifteen
inches. Stand in chest deep water, and hold the ribbon in one hand,
with that arm outstretched in front of you, under the water. Begin to
sweep your arm down about twelve to fifteen inches, and back up,
keeping your hand from breaking the surface of the water at its
highest point. Sweep your
outstretched arm down and
up rhythmically at a rate
that the ribbon begins to
follow the movement of
your arm.
Step 2: Notice how the
ribbon creates a sort of “S”
shape as it flows through
the water. Notice too, that
although the arm holding
the ribbon is initiating the
movement, it is the free
end of the ribbon that is
moving more quickly. This

dolphin action. While the action is initiated high in the body, it is the
feet that exhibit the most motion.
Step 3: Continue making an “S” or wave with the ribbon, sweeping
your outstretched arm down and up through the water. Watch the
free end of the ribbon react to the motion of your sweeping arm.
Now, without slowing the rhythm of your arm movement, bend at the
elbow, and attempt to continue the ribbon’s movement using just
the lower portion of your arm, from your elbow to your hand. Notice
that the wave action of the ribbon diminishes significantly. This is
what happens when a swimmer over-bends at the knees doing
dolphin.
Step 4: Re-establish your full arm motion, and watch the ribbon
again flow through a continuous “S” shape. Without bending
radically at the elbow or wrist, try to make your arm move fluidly
through the water, as if your arm was part of the ribbon. This is how
a good dolphin works, fluidly, gathering the force of the motion
started high in the body and transferring it downward to the feet.

Step 1: At a depth of about six feet, lay face down in the water,
arms at your sides. With a firm core and straight spine, bow forward,
maintaining a stable hip position. Feel your head lead your body
downward toward the bottom of the pool. Allow your legs and feet
to follow. Watch your descent carefully, and before reaching the
bottom of the pool, come out of your bow by raising your upper
body, allowing your legs and feet to follow the same path. As your
head rises, your feet should snap downward. At the top of your

Step 3: Now you have to pretend that you are in water that is only
one foot deep. Lay face down in the water, arms at your sides with a
straight spine and firm core. Bow forward, maintaining your high hip
position. Allow your upper body to descend. Feel your hips, legs and
feet react. Quickly, before reaching the bottom of the one-foot deep
water, raise your upper body out of the bow. Feel your legs and feet
follow quickly. As you head rises, feel your feet snap quickly
downward. Breathe then bow forward again, repeating a very
compact, yet effective forward wave-like dolphin action that is only a
few inches deep.

Dolphin Dives
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Understanding the full-body action of the dolphin
• Experiencing the line of the dolphin
• Feeling the transfer of power to the feet
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Stand in water about hip deep, arms firmly at your sides.
Using the muscles of your core, achieve a straight spine from your
hips through your neck. Keeping your hips firm, bow forward about
twelve inches. At the same time, bend your knees slightly, preparing
to jump off the bottom of the pool.
Step 2: Maintaining your bowed position, jump off the bottom with
force. As your body rises into the air, bow forward more. Notice that
by doing so, the upward force of your jump changes to follow your
head forward.
Step 3: At the highest point in your jump, bow forward even more.
As you begin to descend, notice that instead of landing back on your
feet, you are going to re-enter the water head first. By shifting the
position of your upper body, you have changed the line of your jump
from a simple up and down path, that landed in the same place it
started, to a line that travels forward. By bowing forward, you go up
out of the water, forward over the water, and then down into the
water. At the point your head enters the water, your hips should
actually be higher than your head.

actively bow forward and
jump up with force. Feel your head and upper body lead you through
the wave of the dolphin as you bow forward more. Feel your body
travel up, over, then down into the water, head first. Then as you
come out of your bow, feel your feet snap down. Stand. Practice
several times, until you can do several dolphin dives smoothly in a
row without pausing between them.

SwimmingDrills 199-280 07.06.2011 10:15 Uhr Seite 231
Butterfly
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: In water, at least as deep as you are tall, get into a vertical
position. Engage your core. With your hands extended out from your
sides, begin a gentle sculling action, tracing side-to-side underwater
figure eights with your hands, to keep your head above water.
Step 2: Holding your legs together, but relaxed, begin a gentle
dolphin action by bowing down and up, allowing your legs and feet
to sweep forward and back in reaction. With your ankles relaxed,
allow your feet to snap forward as you come out of your bow. Begin
another bow immediately, and repeat this motion several times in a
row creating a rhythmic wave. Your feet should be sweeping across
about fifteen inches of water.
Step 3: As your extended legs move simultaneously in a sweeping
motion forward and back in the water, think about the movement of
a dolphin’s tail. Where does it begin? In fact, the dolphin uses the
entire length of its body to produce motion. Pretend you have the
tail of a dolphin, that your trunk and legs are part of the movement.
You have no waist or hips, and no knees to bend. Your movement is
fluid and your entire body works to sweep the water in a wave-like
movement. Continue your dolphin until it seems there is no
beginning or end to the
motion.
Step 4: Once you have
achieved a fluid dolphin
action, stop the sculling
action with your hands.
Position your hands: left
hand on right shoulder and
right hand on left shoulder.
Continue your vertical dol-
phin keeping your head
above water. Maintain for
30 seconds. Rest, and then
practice again.

Back Dolphin
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Using the abdominal muscles for dolphin
• Gathering power for lower body movement
• Avoiding over bending at the knees
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall on your back, arms at your sides. Begin a
gentle dolphin action, high in your body and allow it to gather force
as it travels down to your feet.
Step 2: Try to kick the water upward enough to make a small
boiling effect over your feet. Drop your legs down, then kick up
again. Create a rhythmic up and down motion with your legs that
extends about 15 inches deep. Use the entire length of your legs and
your trunk for dolphin on your back.
Step 3: Your head should be almost still as your core and legs
move. Try to keep your head from bouncing so your face submerges.
Also, watch your knees to make sure they are not coming out of the
water too much, or they will produce a wave of water over your face.
Sweep the water upward and downward, rather than closer to you
and then father away. Practice several times.
Step 4: Once you have achieved a fluid dolphin action on your back,
and forward motion, try it with your arms extended over your head.
Produce a smooth, rhythmic
dolphin action that starts
high in your body and
gathers force down to your
feet. Feel how your
abdominal muscles are
engaged. Sweep the water
up and down, producing
forward motion, while your
face stays above water.

Butterfly
ARM STROKE DRILLS
The path of the butterfly underwater arm stroke is similar to the
freestyle arm stroke, only it is done with both arms simultaneously.
It is an extremely powerful arm stroke, and for a short distance can
rival the freestyle in speed. However, because it is just not as
sustainable as the freestyle, it is even more important to practice the
most economic butterfly arm stroke possible, so that butterfly can
be done well for longer. The goal of the following arm stroke drills
for butterfly is to develop a productive arm stroke that maximizes
power and minimizes effort.

Pitch to Press
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Feeling the path of the butterfly arm stroke
• Learning to press back, and not down
• Using correct hand pitch to maintain pressure on the water
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Stand in waist
deep water. Keeping your
feet firmly on the bottom of
the pool, bow forward so
your face is in the water.
Look at the bottom of the
pool. Extend your arms
forward on the surface of
the water slightly wider
than your shoulders. With
your palms down, position
your thumbs slightly lower
than your pinkies. Figure 83 Pitch Hands

Step 2: Stretch your arms
forward, so that your
elbows are locked. This
should extend your reach,
and position your hands
slightly farther apart. As
your hands achieve their
longest reach, bend at the
wrists slightly so your
palms and fingertips are
lower than your wrists and
pitched outward. Sweep
your palms around so you
are pressing back on the
water, not pushing down.
Allow your forearms to
follow your hands, but keep
your elbows high and firm.
Watch your hands as they
pass your face, pressing
back and sweeping slightly
inward, so they are closer
together than their starting
point.
Step 3: As your hands
continue pressing back and
pass your shoulders, they
should also sweep by your
elbows. Adjust the position of your hands so they maintain firm
pressure on the water. As your hands pass under your belly they
should be at their closest point together, closer together than your
elbows. Again adjust the pitch of your hands so they can continue
pressing back. The arm stroke finishes with the hands pressing back
quickly, until the arms are straight and outside each hip.
Step 4: Take a breath and return your hands and head to the
starting position, slightly wider than your shoulders. Repeat the arm

palms around and positioning them to press back on the water, with
your elbows high. As your hands press back towards your belly and
get closer together, change your hand pitch again to sweep quickly
back, until your arms are straight and out from your hips.
Step 5: Continue performing the butterfly arm stroke several times.
Constantly reposition your hands so they press back on the water
and not down. Practice until you can perform several quick arm
strokes in a row, producing enough pressure back on the water so it
is difficult to maintain your footing on the bottom of the pool.

Sweeping Question Marks
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Feeling the path of the butterfly arm stroke
• Sweeping wide to narrow
• Sweeping deep to shallow
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall face down in the water, arms extended in
front of your shoulders. Achieve a “downhill”, and high hip float.
Look at the bottom of the pool. While still gliding forward, perform a
single butterfly stroke with both arms simultaneously moving in a
wide to narrow line. Stretch forward, sweep out and around, then
inward toward your belly. Finish by pressing back quickly past your
waist. Notice that the lines you have traced with your arm stroke
resemble two question marks, one the mirror image of the other
floating flat on the surface of the water. Stand and breathe.
Step 2: Return to the wall, and push off for the butterfly again. Float
“downhill” with high hips.
Look at the bottom of the
pool. Using the momentum
of your push off, again do
one butterfly stroke tracing
a deep to shallow line.
Stretch forward, sweep
down and around, then
upward under your belly.
Finish by pressing back

One-arm Butterfly
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Feeling the rhythm of the butterfly arm stroke
• Practicing the path of the arm stroke
• Pressing back on the water
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall face down in the water, arms extended in
front of your shoulders. Achieve a “downhill”, high hip float. With
your right hand remaining in the extended position, perform a single
butterfly stroke with your left arm. Stretch forward, sweep out and
around, then inward under your belly. Finish by pressing back
quickly past your waist. Breathe toward the moving arm, and do an
over-the-water, freestyle-like recovery.
Step 2: Do another stroke with the same arm, accompanied by a
light dolphin action. When your hand stretches forward, your chest
should be low in the water.
Your feet should snap down
as you first press on the
water. Then, when your
hand presses back to the
finish, your chest should be
high, as your feet should
snap down again. Remem-
ber that the dolphin action
should be generated high
in the body, without exces-
sive knee bend. Repeat the
one arm butterfly several
times, tracing the wide to
narrow, and, deep to
shallow line of the stroke.
Maintain pressure back on
the water, and use two

stroke. The first dolphin propels you into the beginning of the arm
stroke. The second dolphin assists the fast finish of the arm stroke.
Step 3: Continue practicing your one-arm butterfly arm stroke,
accompanied by a rhythmic light dolphin action. Focus on
accelerating your stroke to the rear. Maintain a hand pitch that you
can constantly press back on the water, not down or up. From front
to back, stretch forward, sweep out and around, inward under your
belly, wide to narrow, and, deep to shallow. Finish by pressing back
quickly. Breathe. Recover. Repeat to the far end of the pool.
Step 4: After resting, push off the wall and leave your left arm
extended. Perform the one-arm butterfly with your right arm. Match
your light dolphin to accompany the start and the finish of the
stroke. Accelerate the stroke toward the rear. Continue to the far
end of the pool.
Step 5: Practice the one-arm butterfly for several lengths of the
pool. Keep your hips high and time the kick to match the beginning
and end of your arm stroke. Feel your dolphin move through your
body and assist you in catching water at the beginning of the stroke.
Feel your dolphin assist you again to finish the stroke with speed.

THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Pressing outward the end of the stroke
• Practicing a quick finish of the stroke
• Learning to release the water in back
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall face down in the water, arms extended in
front of your shoulders. Achieve a “downhill” float. Do several
dolphins in a row, beginning each high in your body and snapping
downward to your feet. On the sixth dolphin, start your arm stroke,
bowing forward as your reach, then sweeping around and back,
closer under your belly.
Step 2: As your hands accelerate toward the end of your stroke,
pitch your palms slightly outward. Press back and outward from your
body in a fast finish as your feet snap down again. Your hands
should clear the water between your waist and your hips, several
inches away from your body. Return them to the front, extended and
slightly wider than your shoulders.
Step 3: Do another arm stroke, tracing question marks. As your
hands approach their closest point under your belly, press them back
with speed, and outward like a “J”. Your hands should release the
water and rise easily up
through the surface with
your pinkies up.

Butterfly
RECOVERY DRILLS
The butterfly uses a simultaneous arm recovery over the surface of
the water. It is this characteristic spread wing position that makes
the butterfly such a favorite photo opportunity. It is important to
use a relaxed recovery, however, variations in flexibility make each
swimmer’s butterfly recovery slightly unique. In general, the
recovery is close to the water, as the arms swing around wide from
back to front. When the arms pass the shoulders, they realign to
aim forward. The goal of the following recovery drills for the
butterfly is to achieve a relaxed, direct, and well-aligned recovery
for a better butterfly.
88888888
Pinkies-up
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Learning to maintain a pinkie up position
• Feeling a relaxed recovery
• Creating an arch with your arms over the water
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Standing in front of a mirror, bow forward so your upper
body is horizontal. Beginning with your arms extended in front of
you, do a butterfly arm stroke in the air, stretching forward then
sweeping around, close through the middle, then quickly back and
outward in a “J”. Freeze after the “J”. Notice that your pinkies are the
high point of your hands.
Step 2: Maintaining your pinkie-up hand position, sweep your hand
around and forward through recovery, toward the starting position.
Your arms and hands should be relaxed. Notice the arch that your
two arms make, with your head in the middle. Notice too that as you
sweep to the widest wing span, in order to maintain a pinkie-up
position, you have to lower your chest into the water.

The Flop
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Using your chest and shoulders to recover
• Finishing the recovery in a “downhill” position
• Feeling a relaxed recovery
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall face for the butterfly. After several dolphins,
start your arm stroke. Sweep your arms wide to narrow and deep to
shallow, accelerating to the rear. Round off the end of the stroke and
slide your hands out of the water pinkies first. Recover with a relaxed
wide arm swing, maintaining your pinkie-up position. As your arms
reach their widest position, your shoulders and head should be at the
top of the arch of your recovery. Feel the swing of the recovery come
from the shoulders and chest, rather than from the hands.
Step 2: When your hands pass your shoulders, roll your shoulders
forward. Then as your arms realign to reach forward at the end of the
recovery, drop your chest downward into the water. Do it again.
Stroke and exit the water at the rear pinkies-up. Initiate your recovery
from the shoulders and chest, maintaining a pinkie-up position. As
your hands pass your shoulders, roll your shoulders forward. Drop
your chest down into the
water as your arms reach
forward. It should feel like
your arms are flopping
forward effortlessly.
Step 3: Do several more
strokes, focusing on your
relaxed, pinkie-up recovery,

and shoulders. At the mid-

that doing so adds speed to the
end of your recovery. Notice too
that as your shoulder and chest
action flops your arms auto-

Step 4: Practice more, focusing on
achieving a relaxed recovery from

BREATHING DRILLS
Breathing in the butterfly happens within the line of the stroke, so
that the swimmer inhales when the upper body is naturally at
its highest point, and finishes when the upper body regains its
“downhill” position. Timed correctly, no independent head action
is required to achieve a breath. The most economic breathing style
is low on the water, facing forward. Regular, rhythmic breathing is
important to achieving a sustainable stroke, but successful
butterfliers use a variety of breathing patterns, from breathing every
stroke, to breathing every third stroke. The goal of the following
breathing drills for butterfly is to practice the correct timing of the
breathing so it happens with the natural rhythm of the stroke.

HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Stand in waist deep water. Keeping your feet firmly on the
bottom of the pool, bow forward so your face is in the water. Look
at the bottom of the pool. Extend your arms forward on the surface
of the water, aligning your elbows and thumbs forward. Begin tracing
the question mark line of your arm stroke. As your hands press back
and accelerate to the end of the stroke, stand upright.
Step 2: Inhale as you achieve your full standing position, while your
hands press quickly back and round off the finish of the stroke. As
your hands leave the water, pinkies-up and move into the arch of the
recovery, again bow forward so your body joins the forward line of
the arms as they go over the water. Your face should submerge just
before your hands enter the water in front.

Step 3: Begin another stroke, and stand as your hands transition to
the fast finish. Inhale. Bow forward again as your arms recover,
allowing your face to reach the water before your hands. Do several
strokes, standing to inhale at the end of each one. As you move into
the recovery and bow forward, notice that your head and arms move
in unison towards the front. Your head should beat your arms to the
water because it has a shorter distance to travel.
Step 4: Now try several strokes in a row. Bow forward to begin each
stroke with your face in the water. Stand and inhale as your hands
approach the back of the stroke. Bow forward again as your arms
recover, so your face reaches the water an instant before your hands.
Step 5: Continue to practice, focusing on inhaling at the high point
of your stroke. Allow your body position to determine when your
breath begins and ends.

HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Stand in water that is hip deep, arms extended back and
outside the hips, pinkies-up. Achieve a straight spine from your hips

twelve inches while bending your knees slightly, preparing to jump
off the bottom of the pool.
Step 2: Jump off the bottom with force. As your body rises into the
air, bow forward more, and swing your arms around and forward like
a butterfly recovery. Your arms should be finishing their recovery as
your body begins to descend. As your face enters the water, your
hips should actually be higher than your head, and your arms should
be extended, and in the water, aiming downward toward the bottom
of the pool.
Step 3: As your arms descend, your upper body, legs and feet
should be following the same line, travelling up, over, then down
into the water. Before you reach the bottom of the pool, sweep
through the butterfly arm stroke, and raise your upper body out of
your bow. Feel your legs and feet react to the change of direction. As
your face rises to the surface of water, feel your feet snap down into

your feet to snap down as your finish your stroke. Feel your upper
body rise. Inhale at your highest point, maintaining your head
position. At the highest point, your chin should be just above the
surface of the water, and you should be looking down at the water
right in front of you. As you proceed into the recovery, drop your
chest and face into the water. Notice that without changing your
head position, you are again looking at the bottom of the pool.
Step 6: Practice more, achieving each breath within the line of your
stroke. Maintain a stable head position throughout the stroke, so
you are looking down at the bottom of the pool when your face is in
the water, and down at the water in front of you when you are
inhaling.

water. Recover, rolling your shoulders forward and dropping your
chest down as your arms reach for the front. Feel your face return to
the water and achieve the “downhill” position. Focus on what part of
your face hits the water first.
Step 2: Do another stroke. After the inhale, as your arms and head
move back to the starting position, freeze as your face hits the
water. It should hit the water forehead first, rather than chin first. It
should feel like your forehead hits like a hammer and the water is a
nail.
Step 4: Do another stroke. As you accelerate to the rear and your
upper body rises for the breath, focus on the arch of arms as they
pass over the water. From the beginning to the end of the recovery,
the forward movement of the arms is powered from the core, not the
arms. The core action actually determines the line of the stroke. As
you roll your shoulders forward, feel your head leave the high point
of the stroke. As your hands pass your shoulders, and you drop your
chest down into the water, the line of the stroke aims down and
forward, bringing your face back to the water forehead first, and
positioning your body “downhill” to begin the next stroke.
Step 5: Notice that without changing your head position at all, you
rise from the water to breathe forehead first, and you also return to
the water forehead first. Practice more, using your forehead as the

Butterfly
LEVERAGE DRILLS
Leverage makes the butterfly work. Using it is necessary to
perpetuate the forward momentum of the stroke for any length of
time. While the whole body, from the hands through to the feet
works as a lever, high hips are crucial to benefiting from its effects.
Leverage in butterfly works between the upper body and the hips,
and, between the hips and the feet. The goal of the following
leverage drills for butterfly is to learn to position the body to make
the most of the leverage at each stage of the stroke.
99995555
Advanced One-arm Butterfly
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Maintaining a high hip body position
• Feeling the hips as the center of the butterfly
• Using leverage in the butterfly
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall preparing to do the butterfly. Achieve a
“downhill” float. Position your left arm at your side, while your right
hand is extended in front of you. Perform a single butterfly stroke
with your right arm, finishing quickly as your feet snap down,
looking at the water in front of you as you inhale. Recover from the
core, returning your face to the water and regaining your “downhill”
position.
Step 2: Do another stroke with the same arm, focusing on your
hips. When you are in the “downhill” position at the beginning of
the stroke, your hips should be high. When you are in the inhale
position, your hips should still be higher than your feet, though
lower than your head. During recovery, when you are returning to the
“downhill” position, and as your upper body travels down and
forward into the water, your hips remain high.

face to the water.
Step 2: Do another stroke, maintaining a high hip position, but
purposely do not kick. From the “downhill” position, accelerate
through the sweep of the arm stroke as your upper body rises.
Breathe at the high point of the stroke. Notice that your feet snap
down as you finish the arm stroke and breathe anyway.
Step 3: Recover, using your core to sweep your arms in a wide arch
over the water. Return your face to the water as your chest drops,
and your hands reach for the front. Notice that it is difficult to keep
your feet from snapping down again after your chest drops into the
water at the end of the recovery.
Step 4: In fact, the kick, or foot motion in butterfly is a result of the
other actions of the stroke. Try it again. Holding a high hip position,
but without actively kicking, sweep through to the back of the
stroke. Feel your feet snap down as your upper body and head rise.
Using your core, chest and shoulders, recover as your face returns to
the water. Feel your feet snap down again as you reach forward.
Step 5: Continue doing the butterfly, producing a kick as a result of
the actions of the rest of the stroke. Hold your core firm, and try to

No Pause Fly
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Establishing rhythm from the core
• Maintaining momentum and leverage
• Avoiding damaging pauses in the stroke
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall for the butterfly. Swim to the far end of the
pool. Establish a rhythmic stroke, with evenly spaced kicks. If you
aren’t tired when you reach the wall, swim another length. As you reach
the point where it is hard to maintain a rhythmic stroke, do a few more
strokes, focusing on where in the stroke you lose your rhythm. Identify
the point where your arms are when your rhythm breaks down.
Step 2: Notice that it happens after the arm entry, when your arms
are extended. As you get tired, the extension at the “Y” position
becomes a glide. When the arms come to a stop in front, rhythm is
lost. When rhythm is lost, momentum and leverage are lost as well.
Step 3: Rest again. Now, push off the wall for the butterfly. Do only
four strokes. Make each one a quick stroke. Focus on allowing no
pause at the front of the stroke after your arms enter the water.
Make a seamless transition from the recovery into the next stroke.
Lay your hands on the surface of the water and grab hold of it. With
your chest low in the water at this point, it should almost feel like
you are reaching up with your hands.
Step 4: Rest and try it again. Do four quick strokes, grabbing hold

COORDINATION DRILLS
A well-coordinated butterfly is a thing of beauty. The swimmer
appears to move effortlessly through the water. Truly, a successful
butterfly is less a matter of strength, and more a matter of a
coordinated sequence of stroke actions. When the body position,
dolphin action, arm stroke, recovery, breathing and leverage work
together, the result is a butterfly that moves forward with rhythm,
grace and power. The goal of the following coordination drills for
butterfly is to practice the various actions of the butterfly in
sequence so they benefit stroke as a whole, and improve the
forward line of the stroke.
99998888
Chest Balance
THE PURPOSE OF THIS DRILL
• Benefiting from the “downhill” position
• Avoiding a flat butterfly
• Bringing momentum into the next stroke
HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall preparing to do the butterfly. Achieve a
straight spine, firm core and high hips. Sweep through and at the
highest point in the stroke, take your breath. Recover, swinging your
arms around and forward from the core. Notice that the breathing
action is almost automatic. Perhaps because breathing is a matter of
survival, it is a stroke action that we perfect early on.
Step 2: Take another
stroke, and breathe when
your upper body reaches
its highest point. Freeze
in that position. Notice
that your forward motion

are good and practiced in achieving the breath, it is the part of the
stroke after the breath that deserves attention in terms of
maintaining the momentum and forward line of the stroke.
Step 3: Stroke again. Accelerate through, breathe, and recover.
Notice that it takes deliberate action to get back to the “downhill”
position. You have to actively to angle your upper body correctly, or
you will end up flat, and without momentum for the next stroke. Try
it again. Sweep through to the breathing position, then recover,
actively regaining your “downhill” position, using your core and
shoulders. Drop your chest down and lean “downhill”. At this
moment, your hips should be higher than your head. It should feel
like you are balancing on your chest as you reach forward into the
next stroke. Notice that by doing so you carry momentum with you
into the next stroke.
Step 4: Take another stroke. Accelerate through, breathe, then
deliberately use your core and shoulders during recovery to
transition to the “downhill” position. Press your chest down and
balance on it, feeling your body ride downhill. Stretch forward and
begin the next stroke. Continue swimming butterfly for several
strokes, focusing on achieving this chest balance point before
beginning the next stroke. Rest, then practice again.
Step 5: Practice until balancing on your chest is as automatic as
breathing.

HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Push off the wall for the butterfly. Sweep through the arm
stroke, maintaining high, firm elbows. Sweep your hands closer

press quickly outward in a “J”, feel your feet snap down and your
face rise. Inhale. Notice three stroke actions happening
simultaneously: the finish of the arm stroke, the inhale, and the
down-beat of the second kick.

HOW TO DO THIS DRILL
Step 1: Stand in waist deep water. Bow forward until your chin rests
on the surface of the water. Extend your arms forward aligned with
your shoulders. Do four butterfly arm strokes and recoveries with
your feet on the bottom of the pool, watching your point of entry in
front.
Step 2: Look the splash that results as your hands enter. Notice the
direction that the splash goes. This will tell you where your stroke is

directed, and if you are swimming with the water or against it. Is the
splash from your left arm crashing into the splash from your right
arm? If so, you are directing your stroke side-ways, not forward. Is
the splash from your hands going straight up? If you are directing
your stroke down, not forward.
Step 3: Try it again. Stand in the water and bow forward. Do four
complete strokes watching your entry. Aim each stroke forward at
the end of recovery. At entry, lay your hands on the water, and slide
them through the surface as you extend. Notice that the splash you
make is minimal, and it is directed forward. Practice again, moving
your arms with the water, not against it. Enter the water cleanly,
displacing a minimum of water, and only in the forward direction.
Step 4: Now try it while swimming. Push off the wall for the butterfly.
Do four stroke cycles focusing on directing each new stroke forward
at entry. At the end of recovery, lay your hands quietly on the surface
of the water. Slide them through the surface, fingertips first as you
extend. Anchor your hands just below the surface of the water as
your feet snap down. Sweep through and bring the momentum of

CONCLUSION 5
While there are enough great swimming drills out here to fill several
volumes, I hope you have benefited from the 100 presented in this
book. It has been my pleasure to witness each drill in this collection
having a positive impact on the technique, economy and efficiency
of swimmers I have coached. Just as every swimmer is unique, every
swimmer has a favorite drill, one that has helped him or her feel and
understand swimming better. It is my hope that this book becomes
dog-eared and water-logged, as your poolside companion, along
with your pull buoy and hand paddles, as you explore these drills,
and that through focused practice, you find new favorites that lead
you closer to the experience of more efficient swimming.
