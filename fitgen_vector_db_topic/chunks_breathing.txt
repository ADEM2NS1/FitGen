The relatively smaller muscles of the limbs may ultimately apply the resistance, but the larger muscles of the core are able to produce more force and power, allowing a faster tempo to be created and sustained. The muscles of the core, both in the front and the back of the body, are also our primary stabilizers. As the connectors between the upper and lower limbs, the tension held in these muscles is central to producing efficient and coordinated stroke action. Without core tension, we would not be able to achieve a unified stroke, produce leverage, or maintain balance and alignment throughout the changing positions of the stroke. 38 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 38 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 41 Text --- The Swimming Muscles TAKE A SWIMMING LESSON FROM A SEAL Part of the Pinniped order (from the Latin meaning “wing foot”), we have to look in awe at seals, who are not only among the fastest aquatic mammals but are also the most efficient swimmers. Moving through the water at speeds up to 25 miles per hour (about the same speed as dolphins and whales), seals are at the top of the list in terms of least energy cost associated with producing speed. It seems that seals have perfected swimming. Like humans, seals are air-breathing mammals, and like us, they have four limbs. However, over millions of years, these descendents of bears have adapted to using aquatic locomotion so well that we should stop and pay attention. Watching the seal swimming at high speed, we see that it holds its front limbs flat against the sides of its body and uses a narrow, undulating motion that starts at the head and moves down through its body. This wave action is based on movement and stabilization of the seal’s spine by the

Not top-level racers striving for national championships or dreaming of Olympic glory. Ordinary swimmers. The ones who fall somewhere between Becky Adlington and people who would only swim if they fell out of a boat. In other words, most of us. IS THIS BOOK FOR YOU? There are lots of good books on swimming out there. To work out if this particular one will help you, ask yourself if you fit into one of these categories: • Are you a keen swimmer who turns up at the pool and regularly swims for half an hour or more, getting fitter and fitter – but never much faster? • Does it feel as though you’re splashing your way up and down the pool, while you notice the really good swimmers smoothly gliding along? • Would you like to be able to do triathlons, but find the swim leg so daunting that it puts you off? • Do you find swimming front crawl so tiring that you can only manage a couple of lengths at a time – even though you can swim breaststroke for ages? • Are you aiming to take part

triathlons, but find the swim leg so daunting that it puts you off? • Do you find swimming front crawl so tiring that you can only manage a couple of lengths at a time – even though you can swim breaststroke for ages? • Are you aiming to take part in a long swim for charity and feeling nervous about completing the distance, or maybe wishing you could swim front crawl instead of breaststroke? If you read one or more of these and felt a flash of recognition, Swim Better, Swim Faster can help. SIX SIMPLE ELEMENTS Swim Better, Swim Faster separates front crawl into six key elements. Work on just one of these for even a few hours, and you should feel an improvement in your stroke: --- Page 7 Text --- 1. Flexibility 2. Body position 3. Arm stroke 4. Breathing 5. Kicking 6. Stroke and rhythm People often feel that they have a particular problem with one of these areas, and concentrate on that. But the trick with swimming is to get all the elements of your stroke working together smoothly and in balance. Work on all six over a period of time, and your swimming will quickly improve. TURNS As well as swimming technique, Swim Better, Swim Faster has advice on turns: • Many pool swimmers would like to learn tumble turns, which are a great way of getting more out of your time in the pool. • Triathletes taking part in cold-weather races often do the swim leg in a pool. In some triathlons swimmers are banned from doing tumble turns – but it’s still possible to make up a lot of time by doing the fastest possible touch turn. Top tip The advice and drills in Swim Better, Swim Faster will make you a

Kick your legs 10 times, then take a stroke with your left arm while recovering your right arm. As you do this, your body rolls to the other side and you can take a breath. 3. Repeat this drill all the way down the length of the pool. --- Page 57 Text --- Top tip As a way of controlling your head angle, USE YOUR VISION Swim looking down at the bottom of the pool. Then, as you turn your head to breathe, aim to have your vision across the line of the water’s surface. You should see the world on its side: if it looks like normal, you have tilted your head up to breathe (like the swimmer above) and compromised your streamlined position. THE ENERGY-SAPPING EVILS OF TWIST ‘Twist’ is when your spine bends from side to side as you swim. Twist in your swimming stroke slows you down. It increases drag, and forces you to use more energy than necessary to move forward. ONE SIDE OR BOTH? Ask a friend to watch you swim, from head-on and from behind. They can tell --- Page 58 Text --- you if your stroke has twist in it, and whether the twist is to one side or both sides. Twist to one side If the twist is only on one side, it is often linked to the swimmer’s breathing technique. They are usually breathing only to one side of their body, which makes it harder to swim with a balanced stroke. The advice in this section will help solve the problem, but if your stroke only twists one way, it would also be a good idea to start breathing bilaterally. See for yourself: twist It’s easy to demonstrate to yourself how twist affects your stroke: • Push off the side

allows you to practise the whole arm stroke, concentrating on every aspect of it, before you start swimming using your redesigned arm stroke. --- Page 85 Text --- High-elbow drills Try these drills without swim fins, but if you find your hips are dragging put some on to keep your body position streamlined. What you need • Possibly swim fins 1. Push off into a streamlined position. Instead of swimming alternate right- arm left-arm pull with one arm only. Make sure your focus stays strongly on keeping your elbow high for the catch, and don’t allow your hand to pull in under your body. 2. Allow your body to roll down into the stroke as usual, but make sure you return to a flat, streamlined position after each arm stroke. 3. Having swum a few lengths of this, first on one arm, then the other, try the same action but with alternate strokes. This variation works best with fins: return to a streamlined position after each arm stroke, kick three or five times, then take an arm stroke on the opposite side. Don’t forget to keep your head position looking down at the bottom of the pool. --- OCR from Page 85 Image 1 --- ; | - i --- Page 87 Text --- In this sequence, you can see clearly how the swimmer’s body rolls to the side with each arm stroke, whether he is breathing or not. His hips also roll, but to a lesser degree. The second photo gives a real feeling of how the swimmer has pulled himself forward through the water.

smooth turn of the head; really no more than a slight addition to the roll of your body as you take a stroke. • Keep your neck at the same angle as usual: you’re aiming to turn your head to the side slightly, not to lift it from the water. • Make sure you have breathed out underwater before lifting your mouth clear of the surface. This gives you the opportunity to take on the maximum possible amount of oxygen. Taking a breath --- Page 91 Text --- The same body and head angle, but no breath being taken Top tip One of the mistakes people make most often is lifting their face too far out of the water when they breathe. Remember: ALWAYS LEAVE ONE GOGGLE IN THE WATER If both goggles come out of the water when you turn to breathe, you’ve turned your head too far or are holding it at too high an angle. --- Page 92 Text --- BREATHING IS IMPORTANT! It’s worth recapping why we breathe while swimming. Taking oxygen on board is what allows your muscles to keep working over time. Without it, they quickly build up lactic acid, which causes a burning sensation and forces you to stop within a couple of minutes. The only swimmers who sometimes don’t breathe are 50m sprinters, whose event is over so fast that they don’t have time to build up lactic acid. Anyone swimming further has to take on oxygen. For events such as triathlon, it’s extremely important that lactic acid doesn’t build up during the swim leg and affect you later in the race. Breathing correctly is therefore key. BREATHE IN, BREATHE OUT Of course, there are two elements to breathing: taking in oxygen, and expelling waste gases. • Take all in-breaths smoothly: don’t

it’s extremely important that lactic acid doesn’t build up during the swim leg and affect you later in the race. Breathing correctly is therefore key. BREATHE IN, BREATHE OUT Of course, there are two elements to breathing: taking in oxygen, and expelling waste gases. • Take all in-breaths smoothly: don’t gasp or snatch at your breath, just take a smooth, deep lungful of air. • Breathe out when your face is underwater, a steady release of bubbles that --- Page 93 Text --- starts as soon as your face goes underwater. That way when you have a chance to take oxygen on board, you get the maximum possible amount. BREATHING PATTERNS Your breathing pattern is the number of strokes you do before taking a breath. Most people find it easier to breathe on one side than the other, and end up breathing every two strokes. Overall it’s better to breathe every three strokes, but there are advantages to each pattern. Breathing every two strokes. Advantage: You get more breaths per length, making it easier to swim longer distances without building up lactic acid in your muscles. Disadvantage: It’s easy for your stroke to become lopsided and unbalanced. Breathing every three strokes Advantage: Your stroke has to be balanced and flexible, because you have to learn to roll your body both left and right. Disadvantage: You can’t take in as much oxygen, so sustaining this breathing pattern takes a greater degree of aerobic fitness and training. The acid test is probably whether you just get too tired when using a three-stroke breathing pattern. If so, it may be best to use a two-stroke pattern until your fitness reaches the necessary level. Even then it’s a good idea to change the side on which you breathe every length or so, so that

whether you just get too tired when using a three-stroke breathing pattern. If so, it may be best to use a two-stroke pattern until your fitness reaches the necessary level. Even then it’s a good idea to change the side on which you breathe every length or so, so that you learn to breathe properly on both sides of your body. HEAD POSITION As well as affecting your body position, your head position has an important role to play in your breathing. Too high or low will not only cause drag but also make breathing awkward. The ideal head position comes from your neck being in line with your spine, when viewed from the side. Look very slightly ahead, but at the bottom of the pool rather than directly forwards. --- Page 94 Text --- See for yourself: head position Well, not quite for yourself: you need a friend to assess your head position. Ask your friend to pay attention to the shape of the water pushed up by your head as you swim toward them: • If the water hits your forehead or hairline, and there’s always a bow wave lifting up at the front and curving around the side of your head, your head position is too high. You need to drop your chin a bit. • If only the back of your head is visible, and the water level never comes lower than your hairline, your head position is probably about right. • If your head never comes out of the water at all, your head may be too low, and you need to look a little more ahead. --- Page 95 Text --- Kick–breathe drill This is a really simple drill, which helps you get used to the small movement you should be making to take

No breath on the left --- Page 101 Text --- No breath on the right Breath on the left --- Page 102 Text --- 3–5–7 training If you can train yourself to do it, breathing every three arm strokes is the best technique for most swimmers. It’s hard work at first, and you’ll probably need to increase your capacity for aerobic swimming. This exercise is really more a way of achieving this than a technique drill, but it will help you to maintain a three-stroke breathing pattern. What you need • Fins are useful at first: discard them as you get more comfortable with the drill 1. Swim in three-length units. Give yourself a rest of 10 seconds between each length. Swim the first length breathing every three strokes, the second breathing every five strokes, and the third every seven strokes. You don’t need to be going full tilt, but don’t dawdle along either: this is meant to be a lung buster. 2. Give yourself a 30-second rest, then repeat. 3. Over a period of weeks and months, make things harder, aiming to increase the difficulty whenever you feel you’ve got this one nailed. First, lose the fins. Next, drop the rest between lengths. Then swim in six-length units (3– 5–7, 3–5–7) without a rest between them. --- Page 103 Text --- Keys to success • Time your breath to fit in with the roll of your body • Remember to keep a streamlined head position • Turn your head to breathe – don’t lift it --- Page 104 Text --- • Only turn as far as you need for a breath – keep one goggle in the water at all times --- Page 105 Text ---

too high. It does come to you pretty quickly, though, and it’s a really good drill to return to again and again. It reminds you of good head position, body roll and breathing technique. What you need: • A small, not-too-squishy ball, a bit bigger than a tennis ball 1. Tuck the ball between your chin and your chest. 2. Push off, and start swimming. Try to keep the ball in place, not only as you swim along but also when you breathe. 3. Don’t tense up: remember to keep your jaw and neck relaxed. You’re aiming to hold the ball in place, rather than clamping it tightly down. --- Page 124 Text --- Three-quarter catch-up This simple drill is good for many elements of your stroke. It emphasises the extension and glide of the hand entry and catch phases of your stroke. The drill is also a good way to develop roll and breath timing, and done without fins it plays up the role of your leg kick in maintaining a good body position. This drill can be hard work aerobically when done without fins, so is probably best tackled one length at a time, with a 15-second rest between lengths. What you need • Swimming lane with line along the bottom • Swim fins for some versions 1. If you want to focus on arm technique and timing, put on swim fins. For all- --- Page 125 Text --- round stroke development, leave the fins on the poolside. 2.

2. Push off along the line, concentrating on keeping your head and the centre line of your body directly above it. Take an arm stroke, leaving the other arm extended in front of you. 3. Delay the pull of your extended arm until the recovering arm is just about to enter the water. Repeat this stroke and rhythm with the other arm, and carry on all the way down the pool. There are several versions of the catch-up drill. Two of the most useful are full catch-up and reverse catch-up. Full catch-up This is essentially the same drill as three-quarter catch-up, but harder. Instead of starting your arm pull as the recovering arm is about to enter the water, wait until it has slid beneath the surface and is starting to extend. --- Page 126 Text --- Full catch-up Reverse catch-up This drill demands (and so trains you to) a greater level of coordination between body roll and breathing. In reverse catch-up, instead of one arm being stretched out unmoving in front of you, it rests by your side with your hand by your hip. This is basically putting the ‘stop’ in at the other end of your arm pull, before the recovery instead of after. Tarzan-and-Jane This advanced drill is great for checking how well you’re able to keep your body swimming straight, without twisting or kinking. It’s a good one for open- water racers, including triathletes: it helps you get a sense for swimming in a straight line without being able to see where you’re going the whole time. I call this the Tarzan-and-Jane drill, because I started doing it when I was a kid, after seeing Jonny Weissmuller and Maureen O’Sullivan, as Tarzan and Jane, swimming like this in a jungle pool. --- Page 127 Text ---

pool, a smoother, more efficient stroke uses less energy for the same speed. This is probably even more important in open water: events are over longer distances, so the effect of tiny inefficiencies is magnified. One difference from the pool is in stroke rate: open-water swimmers generally swim with a higher arm cadence than pool swimmers, of between 73 and 85 strokes per minute. ADAPTING TO CONDITIONS Open water swimming sometimes – nearly always, in fact – forces you to adapt your technique to the conditions. The key change is that if the water is choppy, a higher recovery of the forearm and hand is needed. This avoids your hand or arm being caught in the chop or wave face. You may also have to adapt your breathing pattern: if waves are coming from the left, breathe to the right, and vice versa. That way you’re less likely to swallow what feels like a small bucketful of water with each stroke. --- Page 157 Text --- Body-rotation mixed drill Good body rotation is as important in open-water swimming as it is in the pool. This mixed drill is hard work when done without fins, so it’s best to start with them on until you’re comfortable with the drill. What you need • Swim fins • Pull buoy 1. Push off in a streamlined position, but with your arms by your sides instead of stretched out ahead. Kick with a steady rhythm. 2. Keep looking downwards, not forwards. Take breaths on alternate sides, simply by rolling your body. Don’t move your arms or turn your neck to breathe, just roll your body. 3. After one length, take off your fins and put your pull buoy between your ankles (not your thighs as usual) or calves. Swim two lengths like this, concentrating

Swim to the cone without sighting again, aiming to finish your length as close to it as possible. OPEN-WATER SWIMS If you get really into open-water swimming, there are some fantastic events around the world that make a great excuse for a trip away. Bosphorus Cross-Continental: follow in the flipper-prints of Lord Byron, in this annual swim down the Bosphorus from Asia to Europe. Damme-Brugge Open Water: a 5km race along a Belgian canal, which was first held in 1910. Hyde Park Christmas Morning Swim: every Christmas Day, a bunch of loonies turns up to swim in the Serpentine, in London. It’s only 90m from one side to the other, but it’s very, very cold. Manhattan Island Marathon Swim: one for the serious distance swimmers, 46km around Manhattan Island in New York. Swim Around the Rock: 5.2km around Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay, where swimmers must contend with icy water, strong currents and the possibility of being eaten by sharks. --- Page 175 Text --- Swim Thru Perth: 2.2km and 4km swims in Perth, Australia, to Matilda Bay.

This is particularly true if you’ve introduced a new element to your stroke – the high-elbow pulling action, for example. If you’ve been swimming in a particular style for years, it will take a long time for a new style to become automatic. Until then, you’ll need to keep reminding yourself at regular intervals. WHEN TO WORK ON TECHNIQUE You’re not likely to achieve much if you only ever work on your technique after a hard training session, when you’re tired. It’s easy to slip into thinking you should be training hard, getting fitter, getting stronger, but none of these will bring you as much benefit as improving your technique. It’s best to devote a whole swim purely to technique work: your body and mind are fresh, and you concentrate harder, getting maximum benefit from your time in the water. Alternatively, if your time in the pool is severely squeezed, you could make technique work part of your warm-up, or spend the first part of the session doing drills, before getting into the fitness part of the session. SPEED VERSUS QUALITY Whenever you’re doing any of the exercises or drills in this book (or any others that you’ve developed for yourself), try to make an active decision not to go fast. There’s an old saying that applies here: ‘First, do it. Then, do it right. Last, do it fast.’ Technique

swimmers as they push off from the wall. This position has a very low level of drag, lower than when swimming normally. The quickest way to swim is to push off from the wall and hold this streamlined position until the speed drops to normal swimming speed and then ‘break-out’ into full stroke. The length of this push-off is normally around 5 m (15 feet) but some elite swimmers can hold the position up to the maximum FINA-legal limit of 15 m (45 feet) and accompany it with a powerful kick. See Chapters 9 and 10 for a discussion of the other benefits of using a good torpedo push-off when you swim. --- Page 31 Text --- A pace clock has two opposite second hands – with practice you can time yourself over any distance using it. In open water swimmers gain an advantage from swimming behind or to the side of other swimmers, a technique known as ‘drafting’. ‘Short Course’ and ‘Long Course’ pools are technical terms to describe 25 m and 50 m (or yards) pools respectively. The Olympic Games always uses a long course pool and generally they are slightly slower to swim in than a short course pool as the swimmer turns less often and so loses the speed benefit from a strong push-off from the wall. FINA world championships are swum in both long course and short course pools. Two separate sets of world records are kept for long and short course pools.

page at www.swimsmooth.com/worldrecords has a full and up-to-date listing of these complete records and makes for fascinating reading when comparing it to your own times! ‘Hypoxic Breathing’ is the process of swimming whilst limiting your supply of oxygen by breathing less frequently than normal, typically every five, seven or nine strokes. Many coaches state that this helps to build lung capacity and aerobic endurance but definitive studies demonstrating this are lacking. At Swim Smooth we use sets of restricted breathing frequency to allow the swimmer to focus on a deeper exhalation in the water rather than holding your breath. When breathing less frequently you should aim to stay calm and to allow yourself time to focus on the symmetry of your stroke. ‘Drafting’ is the act of swimming behind or to the side of another swimmer to gain an advantage. This is perfectly legal in open water swimming and triathlon and viewed --- Page 32 Text --- as fair-play with swimmers looking to maximise the benefit they gain when racing. As we shall see in Chapter 36, there are two positions to draft in, either directly behind or to the side and slightly behind another swimmer. ‘Sighting’ is the act of raising the head above the water’s surface to look forward and navigate in open water whilst swimming. Lifting the head places downward pressure on the legs as the body pivots around its centre and this creates extra drag. As we shall see in Chapter 35, a good sighting technique minimises the head lift to minimise additional drag.

the water is going to be useful for you and will make a real difference to your efficiency and level of relaxation. We also strongly encourage you to learn to breathe bilaterally, which is important as a natural way of keeping your stroke symmetrical and can even help you develop the catch phase of your stroke. Don’t worry if you’ve tried bilateral breathing before and struggled, we’ll show you why that was and how to conquer it. Breathing timing, specifically breathing late, can also be a problem for more advanced swimmers. We’ll look at breathing timing in the final part of this section. --- Page 49 Text --- Exhalation For all swimmers it’s important to constantly exhale whenever you are face down in the water. This rids your lungs and bloodstream of CO and means that when you do rotate 2 to breathe you have more time to inhale as you don’t have to exhale first. It also helps to improve your body position as too much buoyancy in the chest lifts your front end up and puts downward pressure on the legs. PAUL: If you’ve ever done any yoga you’ll intuitively understand the relationship between breathing technique and relaxation. If you hold your breath you automatically become tense – please never never do this when swimming! Instead focus on exhaling into the water with a long constant stream of bubbles. I ask swimmers I’m coaching to experiment with making sounds into the water as they exhale, for example the ‘brrrrrr’ sound of a motorboat or motorbike. As simplistic as this sounds it can really make a huge difference to your swimming. Exhaling into the water sounds easy but can be surprisingly hard to learn. For many swimmers it simply doesn’t feel like a natural thing to do. To develop

and exhaling at the last second 25 m exhaling smoothly 25 m holding again ADAM: The key point to remember with exhalation is that as swimmers we are not usually restricted by how much air we can get in but how efficiently we exhale out. Clearing the lungs smoothly before taking a deep breath of air on the next inhalation (without gasping) will really help to keep you more relaxed and aerobic in the water. --- OCR from Page 50 Image 2 --- ey eee eS --- Page 51 Text --- You will really notice the contrast, the difference a good exhalation technique can make is truly amazing! THE BUBBLE BUBBLE BREATHE MANTRA Now is an excellent time to experiment with some bilateral breathing if you have not done so already – a better exhalation technique will make things much easier for you to go from breathing every two strokes to breathing every three. As we will see when we look at bilateral breathing in a little more depth later on, it is usually the fear that if breathing every two strokes is challenging already, how could you possibly breathe every three? Try this simple mantra: Take a breath and then on each of the following two strokes say ‘bubble’ into the water. Literally speak it into the water to emphasise the exhalation during each stroke! On the third stroke take a breath to that side whilst saying ‘breathe’ to yourself (not out loud!). Swimming down the lap repeating ‘breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe’ is a great way to coordinate good exhalation with the timing required to breathe every three strokes (bilateral breathing). The chances are you might still feel rather strange breathing to your unfamiliar side but with the tips that follow, we will show you how to improve that too. Using the

is a great way to coordinate good exhalation with the timing required to breathe every three strokes (bilateral breathing). The chances are you might still feel rather strange breathing to your unfamiliar side but with the tips that follow, we will show you how to improve that too. Using the Bow Wave An efficient stroke technique keeps the head low in the water when breathing. Many swimmers feel that they need to lift their heads to find air but lifting the head excessively causes the whole upper torso to lift and the legs to sink, creating a large amount of drag. The secret to keeping your head low in the water is to breathe into the trough of air formed by the bow wave created around your head. Every swimmer has a bow wave, it’s formed as the head pushes forwards through the water creating a small rise in the water in front of the head and then a trough alongside the chin and neck – a channel of air beneath the main surface level of the water. It’s important to appreciate that the bow wave forms off the top of your head and is just deep enough to breathe into by the time it passes the level of your mouth. If you lift your head clear out of the water to breathe then the bow wave will not form off the top of your head and so the trough will not be there for you! This is a very common occurrence for those swimmers who feel they must lift their heads excessively high to keep from swallowing water. Ironically enough, if this instinctive action can be controlled and the head kept lower when breathing, it becomes much easier to get a breath in. Equally though, some swimmers completely bury

Ironically enough, if this instinctive action can be controlled and the head kept lower when breathing, it becomes much easier to get a breath in. Equally though, some swimmers completely bury their heads in the water in an effort to improve body position which, as we will see in Chapter 8, might not be necessary for every swimmer. Furthermore, the act of burying the head may be problematic if it is too deep to cause the bow wave to form cleanly. The bow wave forms at the top of your head as it travels through the water; it causes a trough of air beside your mouth to breathe into. --- Page 52 Text --- When developing a good bow-wave breathing technique think about keeping the top of your head low in the water and try and breathe ever so slightly behind you into area (A) shown in Figure 7.4. If you crane your head forwards (B) then the bow wave isn’t as deep, which makes breathing much harder. Many swimmers who spend a lot of time training in the open water often develop position (B) from trying to sight forwards and breathe at the same time, as we will see in Chapter 35 this is something to be avoided. FIGURE 7.4 The ideal breathing angle is (A) where the bow wave is quite deep. If you breathe slightly too far forwards (B) then you will have to crane your head high to reach air.

(B) then you will have to crane your head high to reach air. Popeye Breathing: A great way to avoid taking on water when breathing is to angle your mouth to the side like Popeye when he’s chewing his spinach! This lets you keep your head a little lower whilst still breathing into the air in the bow-wave trough. --- Page 53 Text --- One simple way to make sure you have this position correct is to ask a friend or coach to walk along the side of the pool with you as you swim. Ask them to walk as close to the water’s edge as possible and ever so slightly behind the level of your eyes. When you go to breathe, you should be able to see their feet walking alongside you. Avoid turning the head too much to see their whole body, seeing the feet is enough. Experiment with making subtle adjustments to the walker’s position relative to you until you find a comfortable breathing point where you are not lifting your head too high or looking too far forward or back. Looking too far back (C) in Figure 7.5 may cause you to bend in the middle and start snaking down the pool or crossing over in front of your head. FIGURE 7.5 Breathing a little too far behind you (position C) can bring your hand across the centre line in front of your head, as we see Serena doing here. --- Page 54 Text --- SPLIT SCREEN VISUALISATION When you are working on keeping your head position low in the water, use fins and aim for a Split Screen View with the lower goggle beneath the water and the upper goggle above.

in your stroke technique. As we get into other areas of stroke technique we’ll often be asking you to let the breath take care of itself and maintain an awareness of another part of your stroke. Bilateral Breathing Bilateral breathing is the ability to breathe to the left and the right, swapping sides regularly as you swim. We are big fans of bilateral breathing at Swim Smooth for a very practical reason: it helps keep your stroke symmetrical. Many swimmers find bilateral breathing hard at first, if you have tried and failed before don’t worry, we will help you crack it! Most people think of bilateral breathing as breathing every three strokes. This is certainly the most common way and the one we’d recommend for you to use as it’s about the right duration between breaths. However, any breathing pattern where you swap sides regularly is bilateral breathing too, for example: Breathing 2-3-2-3: This means breathing twice to one side in a row and then performing three strokes to swap to the other side for two breaths in a row. This breathing pattern is used by many elite swimmers when racing. --- Page 55 Text --- Breathing 5s: Breathing every five strokes can be useful for those with a fast stroke rate who find that breathing every three comes around too often. Swapping sides every lap of the pool: This is often done for tactical reasons to keep a close eye on a competitor in another lane, or simply for something different and engaging. Breathing just to one side is the leading cause of a lopsided stroke, creating issues such as snaking and scissor kicks. If you are a triathlete or open water swimmer then you should be seriously concerned with the symmetry of your stroke. A lopsided stroke is

something different and engaging. Breathing just to one side is the leading cause of a lopsided stroke, creating issues such as snaking and scissor kicks. If you are a triathlete or open water swimmer then you should be seriously concerned with the symmetry of your stroke. A lopsided stroke is never a good thing but in the pool you can minimise the harm done by keeping yourself straight with the guidance of the black line and the lane ropes. However in open water a lop-sided stroke is a serious liability as it will cause you to constantly track off course and swim much further than you have to. What is the most natural way to keep your stroke symmetrical? Bilateral breathing of course! Even if you feel you are slightly slower in the pool breathing bilaterally, you’ll gain back all this time and much more in open water by swimming much straighter. How much of your training should you perform breathing bilaterally? If possible, all of it. Some swimmers struggle with hard sets breathing every three strokes; if that is you then we would still encourage you to perform as much as possible breathing to both sides, even if you only think of bilateral breathing as a drill. As long as the majority of your training is bilateral then your stroke should stay symmetrical. PAUL: Perhaps you’re thinking: ‘this is all very well but I just can’t hold my breath for three strokes!’. But right there lies the problem – you should never hold your breath when you swim! We started this chapter by developing a good exhalation technique and this is the key you need to unlock the door to bilateral breathing. If you hold your breath the CO builds up in your lungs and blood stream, and you

you should never hold your breath when you swim! We started this chapter by developing a good exhalation technique and this is the key you need to unlock the door to bilateral breathing. If you hold your breath the CO builds up in your lungs and blood stream, and you start to feel 2 very desperate for air. You would never hold your breath when cycling or running and you shouldn’t when swimming either. Rid yourself of that CO and bilateral breathing becomes a whole lot more achievable. 2 There are certain situations, when racing in the pool or in the open water, when unilateral breathing would be more beneficial than bilateral breathing, which we will discuss further in Chapter 36. Your ability to breathe equally well to either side will be a tactical trump card in racing situations so that you can draft another swimmer closely or --- Page 56 Text --- keep a close eye on a competitor who might put in a surge at any point. Practicing breathing to both sides in training will give you this ability in races. The Two-Week Bilateral Hump If you are lucky you will take easily to bilateral breathing but most swimmers find it a little strange and awkward at first breathing to their less favoured side. That’s OK, allow yourself about two weeks (or six sessions) to persevere and keep your discipline with it. We call this the ‘two-week bilateral hump’ after which breathing to both sides should start to feel progressively easier every time you swim. The mistake many swimmers make is to try bilateral breathing for a session or two and then give up – keep your discipline a little longer and you can crack it! PAUL: But what about the argument that bilateral breathing makes you less

feel progressively easier every time you swim. The mistake many swimmers make is to try bilateral breathing for a session or two and then give up – keep your discipline a little longer and you can crack it! PAUL: But what about the argument that bilateral breathing makes you less aerobic when racing? Any breathing pattern will make you less aerobic when you’re racing if you’re holding your breath under the water; as such good exhalation practice is always essential. The irony is that breathing every two strokes to just one side when racing often doesn’t give you enough time to exhale properly and consequently inhalation becomes shallower and more of a gasp. Whatever breathing pattern you ultimately choose – please always remember to exhale! Always bear in mind that if you find bilateral breathing awkward or uncomfortable there is usually something amiss elsewhere within your stroke, which, if fixed, will not only improve your stroke in its own right but also make bilateral breathing easier. A win-win if you’re prepared to commit to making the change and becoming a better, more versatile swimmer. ADAM: During my eight years as a competitive triathlete I only ever breathed to my right, in fact when swimming a hard set today I still feel a compulsion to breathe just to my right, which I have to resist. Since I joined Swim Smooth in 2008 I’ve made the effort to transition to bilateral breathing – it took me around six swim sessions to feel comfortable doing it and then another few months of swimming before it felt natural. The interesting thing is that if I switch back to breathing to one side now, within just 50 m I start to feel awkward and crabby in my stroke! By 100 m I’m starting to veer

comfortable doing it and then another few months of swimming before it felt natural. The interesting thing is that if I switch back to breathing to one side now, within just 50 m I start to feel awkward and crabby in my stroke! By 100 m I’m starting to veer around in the lane and have to really focus on staying straight. Bilateral Breathing and Overgliding As we’ll see in our Swim Types section (starting at Chapter 17), some swimmers have focused on lengthening out their strokes by adding in an extended pause and glide at the front, something we call ‘Overgliding’. As we will see, this style of stroke is not only inefficient but it also slows down the stroke so much that it becomes very hard to breathe every third stroke – the time between breaths is simply too long. It’s no coincidence then that many Overgliders become very lopsided with their strokes as they are stuck breathing to one side only. In Chapter 21 we will take a close look at Overgliding and show you how to improve the rhythm and timing of your stroke for --- Page 57 Text --- enhanced efficiency. Lifting your stroke rate into the ‘normal’ range will allow you to breathe every third stroke and maintain your symmetry much more effectively. Breathing Timing The timing of breathing is something that is often overlooked by coaches and swimmers. When the swimmer rotates to breathe, the head should rotate with the body at the same time: With good breathing timing, the head slightly leads body rotation. Many swimmers, even some elite swimmers, turn the head a fraction later once the body is already rotated. If breathing to your right for example, the right arm will already be into its recovery phase over the top

fact it is normally your preferred breathing side which has late timing! Although you may feel less comfortable breathing to your un-favoured side you will not have developed any bad habits there and so are likely to have better breathing technique, with better timing and less head lift. --- Page 59 Text --- CHAPTER 8 Body Position A high body position in the water is very important for fast, efficient swimming: the legs, hips and feet should all be in one horizontal line near the surface. A swimmer with low-lying legs in the water creates a huge amount of drag, slowing them down dramatically. If you swim more quickly or more easily with a pull buoy between your legs, or are dramatically quicker in a wetsuit, then this is a strong indication that a low body position is a serious issue in your stroke. If you have a low body position in the water then you need to work on improving it as an absolute priority for your swimming: it will be the single biggest thing holding you back. The most common causes of a poor body position are: Holding Your Breath Underwater (Chapter 7). Holding onto your breath creates excess buoyancy in the chest, which lifts you up at the front and sinks your legs. Work on developing a nice smooth exhalation into the water. Michelle has a great body position in the water with chest, hips, legs and feet all in a horizontal line. A High-Lifting Head When Breathing (Chapter 7). In a similar manner to holding your breath, lifting your head high to breathe causes you to pivot at your hips and sink your legs. Developing your bow-wave breathing technique is essential to improving your body position. Looking Too Far Forward in the Water (this chapter). Many

Breathing (Chapter 7). In a similar manner to holding your breath, lifting your head high to breathe causes you to pivot at your hips and sink your legs. Developing your bow-wave breathing technique is essential to improving your body position. Looking Too Far Forward in the Water (this chapter). Many new swimmers with poor natural buoyancy and a feeling of breathing anxiety will swim looking too far forward in the water which in turn can sink the legs at the back. --- OCR from Page 59 Image 1 --- TOR ET ETRE --- Page 60 Text --- Kicking From The Knee (Chapter 9). A poor kicking technique with excess knee bend adds a lot of drag and sinks the legs. Work on moving to a kicking technique with a straighter leg driven from the hip. Scissor Kick (Chapter 9). A scissor kick is normally caused by a crossover of the lead arm in front of the head. This causes a loss of balance and with it an involuntary scissoring of the legs to avoid toppling onto your back. By improving your hand entry and swimming posture (Chapters 10 and 12) you will remove the scissor kick and so improve your body position. Dorsi Flexed Ankles (Chapter 9). Poor ankle flexibility is a problem for many triathletes with a running or cycling background. Such sports create a lot of stability in the ankle, which harms the swimmer’s ability to point their toes. The resultant drag causes the legs to drop down. Under Kicking (Chapter 9). Swimmers who are focusing on making their stroke very long often try a two-beat kick to further reduce effort. For many swimmers with poor natural buoyancy or poor ankle flexibility this does not produce enough lift and their legs sink downward. Poor Core Stabilisation (Chapter 10).

wrist is important as it will help you initiate the catch itself. If you create too much of a downward angle you will feel your hand pull down towards the bottom of the pool. This is a bit like having your hand out of a car window, changing the angle of your hand in the airflow to pull it up and downward. Experiment with the lead hand in the same way when you are kicking on your side in the pool. --- Page 106 Text --- By aiming to start his catch from very near the surface of the water, Paul C has unwittingly dropped his elbow and from here will have to press down on the water during the initial catch. Spearing forwards a little lower in the position shown will give Paul a much greater use of the effective arc of his catch. Supporting Yourself while Breathing A significant benefit of entering the water and extending forward in this position is that it offers you good support and stability at the front of your stroke. In contrast many swimmers’ lead arms collapse down when breathing, removing any support offered to them. This causes the head to sink and the mouth to drop below the surface, making breathing a real struggle! If you take on water when you swim then introducing a better catch set-up position in your stroke will give you much more support when breathing. Clare’s arm drops down when breathing, giving her very little support. You may find, however, that your arm still wants to drop down as the movement has become a habit.

To help break this, use the mantra 1 - 2 - Stretch as you swim, the 1 and --- Page 107 Text --- 2 on non-breathing strokes and the Stretch when breathing to keep you focused on keeping the lead arm extended and offering you support. Developing Your Catch Step 2: Catch Mechanics The key to a great catch and pull through is to press the water backwards using the hand and forearm as a paddle. Pushing the water downward or to the side harms the catch and wastes a great deal of energy. To help you develop your catch we are going to use three main drills: Scull #1, Scull #2 and Doggy Paddle. Each will help you get a feel for pressing the water backwards in a bent elbow position. PAUL: Any time you struggle to perform a drill I think you should actually look at this as a positive: you’ve simply uncovered an area of your stroke technique or proprioception that needs work and you stand to benefit greatly from working on it! Sculling is a very valuable exercise, which helps to develop your ‘feel for the water’ – learning how the water should feel to you during the catch and how to time the stroke movements to create good propulsion. Most swimmers find sculling challenging at first but that’s OK, follow our pointers carefully and you will soon get better at it. --- Page 108 Text --- SCULL #1 Referring to the full drill description for Scull #1 in Appendix A, push off down the lap with a pull buoy between your legs and raise your head above the surface. Start sculling the water left and right in

Overgliders, this is a very powerful image to demonstrate how your catch-up style (6) can lead you to overglide and apply the brakes at the front of your stroke (7). Given that many true Overgliders are intentionally targeting a slow stroke rate, you can see here how applying the brakes would slow your stroke rate down – for this reason putting on the brakes and Overgliding are strongly linked. Use the process in Chapter 13 to develop a better catch technique and your stroke rate will naturally lift, returning a nice sense of rhythm to your stroke. --- Page 139 Text --- The Front View (8) shows parts of the catch and pull-through in more detail. If you are a more advanced swimmer you may be wondering how you can improve your catch – this angle will give you a prime insight into that. What is the angle of your elbow bend during the pull-through? Is it greater than 140° or less than 90°? If so your catch probably needs some refining (8). Many swimmers will press down with a straight arm rather than bending the elbow and pressing backwards. You are also looking to examine the amount of bubbles coming off the arms too. If you fight the water you will see a sleeve of bubbles compared to someone with an efficient stroke having a clean pull-through. Other flaws to watch out for from this angle are crossing over of the centre line under the body (9) and also whether you are holding your breathing underwater – we should see a constant stream of bubbles exiting from either your nose or mouth. --- Page 140 Text --- PAUL: One word of caution when performing your own video analysis: don’t become so pedantic about your stroke that you invoke ‘paralysis

whether you are holding your breathing underwater – we should see a constant stream of bubbles exiting from either your nose or mouth. --- Page 140 Text --- PAUL: One word of caution when performing your own video analysis: don’t become so pedantic about your stroke that you invoke ‘paralysis by analysis’. Rome wasn’t built in a day, so after breaking your stroke down work on a single aspect at a time, this will be much more productive than trying to change everything at once. As you go along, use the Stroke Technique (Key 1) chapters of this book to recognise the Cause and Effect nature of your stroke flaws and discover what the underlying causes are. Remember: one at a time! Should We All Swim The Same? --- Page 141 Text --- CHAPTER 17 The Swim Types System Coaching the Swimmer, Not the Stroke Since Swim Smooth’s creation in 2004, we’ve talked a lot about the need for an individual approach in swimming; how swimmers needed to work on different aspects of their technique based on their age, height, experience, gender and even personality. In contrast to this, many traditional swimming programmes treat everyone the same and have them repeat the same visualisations and drills constantly with one ideal stroke in mind. This one-dimensional approach has several major disadvantages: Ceinwen is 1.60 m tall and Andy is 2.00 m. Should these two swimmers adopt the same stroke style? The vision of a perfect stroke may not suit the swimmer’s physical attributes e.g. height, strength, gender, natural buoyancy. The starting point of the swimmer is ignored and so the coaching is never tailored to their individual needs. As a consequence their rate of progress is dramatically slowed or stops completely. --- Page 142 Text --- No account is taken of

This poor feel means that the lead hand collapses down when breathing offering very little support. This is why breathing feels challenging to many Bambinos and they commonly take on water when trying to breathe. Poor kicking technique, often kicking from the knee. This is hard work as it uses the large muscle groups of the quadriceps and hamstrings, and it creates large amounts of drag. A tendency to push the water upwards rather than backwards at the rear of the stroke. This upwards push pulls the legs downward and does not create any propulsion. For the full Bambino stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 160 Text --- CHAPTER 20 The Kicktastic --- Page 161 Text --- Like Bambinos, Kicktastics are often female but unlike Bambinos, they normally have a background in swimming to a greater or lesser extent. As the name suggests, they have a dominant 6-beat kick which powers them through a relatively poor catch phase of the arm stroke in front of the head. They generate very little propulsion from the front of their stroke and make up for this with a push from the legs. Many Kicktastics swam as a young child and then stopped swimming in their teens. This is a very common scenario as young kids always swim with a dominant leg kick before they develop the arm length and proprioceptive feel required for good upper-body propulsion. When Kicktastics resume swimming as an adult they carry on where they left off with the trademark Kicktastic style. PAUL: The problem with over-kicking is that it’s such an inefficient source of propulsion. If we could transfer your propulsion over to your arm stroke you would be swimming much quicker or much easier at the same speed. Despite having a very dominant kick, the action

the trademark Kicktastic style. PAUL: The problem with over-kicking is that it’s such an inefficient source of propulsion. If we could transfer your propulsion over to your arm stroke you would be swimming much quicker or much easier at the same speed. Despite having a very dominant kick, the action is so familiar to Kicktastics that most are unaware of how hard they are kicking. Ironically, many feel their kick is quite weak! In some cases this may be true in terms of propulsion — although all Kicktastics have a vigorous kick, some do not have very good kicking technique and so generate very little propulsion despite the high level of effort. Kicktastics like to kick and kick hard! --- Page 162 Text --- One disadvantage of working so hard with the legs is that it uses a huge amount of oxygen in the body making many Kicktastics short of breath when they swim. Most are aware of this shortness of breath and assume that there’s something wrong with their fitness. ADAM: A good way to prove that it’s the kick causing your shortness of breath is to swim with a pull buoy and keep your legs held straight behind you. Despite potentially being slower as you lose your propulsion from the legs, monitor your breathing and if it feels much easier then that’s cast- iron proof you’re over-kicking in your stroke. Kicktastics vary hugely in terms of swimming speed, ranging between 2:00 per 100 m to under 1:20 per 100 m depending on their level of arm propulsion and also the effectiveness of their kicking technique. At the very fast end there is a crossover with the Smooth Swim Type who also use a propulsive 6-beat kick, albeit with extremely good arm propulsion too! For obvious reasons Kicktastics dislike

physical) you deserve to swim much more effectively in this environment. Overglider Key Stroke Flaws The Overglider’s dominant stroke flaw is a large dead spot in their stroke timing caused by the introduction of a long glide into their stroke. Working on their catch technique and developing their stroke rhythm will get them off the speed and efficiency plateau they find themselves on. A long pause-and-glide is always present at the front of an Overglider’s stroke, interrupting their rhythm and causing them to decelerate significantly during the resultant dead spot. Many Overgliders’ recovering arms ‘catch up’ at the front giving what is known as ‘catch-up timing’. A much better timing is where the hands just pass in front of the head with the stroking arm already into the catch phase as the recovering arm comes past the head. A poor catch technique with the elbow dropping and very often the palm of the hand facing forwards ‘putting on the brakes’. This is a by-product of trying to swim with a long slow stroke style since the poor catch technique acts to slow the stroke down (see Chapter 13) and so supports the desire to glide. After the glide, the swimmer has to rush the catch to get the stroke back underway. A hurried catch action causes the hand to slip backwards with very little purchase on the water. It is common to see Overgliders only breathing to one side as they swim, normally this is because their stroke rate is so slow that it’s too long between breaths to breathe every three strokes. Over time breathing to one side develops a lopsided stroke with a lack of symmetry, this is particularly a problem for open water swimming where it can cause the swimmer to track off course constantly. After the

tackling anxieties is working out what it is that specifically brings on an attack — for example it could be swallowing some water and fearing you’re going to choke or perhaps losing your orientation and sense of direction. Other common triggers can be the cold itself, fear of the deep, fear of marine life or swimming into reeds. The reasons will be very personal to you and your circumstances. During the anxiety of an open water swim start it is essential that you block out everything around you and focus just on yourself. --- Page 253 Text --- 2. Become Selfish. When you’re training in the pool and thinking about your technique, you’re only ever concerned about yourself and how well you’re performing the exercise. The environment is calm and controlled and you can go about your task easily. As soon as you enter open water that calm internal focus can be rapidly replaced with thinking about external factors which are out of your control such as other swimmers, waves, fish, the thought of touching something, etc. A key skill for swimming well in open water is to block out those thoughts and return your focus on to you, your stroke and your breathing. We call this ‘becoming a selfish swimmer’! 3. Use Cue Words. Often referred to as mantras, repeating cue words such as ‘relax’, ‘breathe’, ‘control’, ‘smooth’ can help keep you focused on the here and now of each stroke rather than letting your mind wander to things out of your control. One of our best teaching mantras that also works well in the open water is ‘breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe’ as outlined in Chapter 7. Give it a try — simplicity of focus is key in the open water. 4.

have the technology to find out. Whilst Dan’s example might sound quite extreme, as we see more and more GPS data at Swim Smooth we find that swimming 10% or more too far in a race is really very common. If you don’t --- OCR from Page 255 Image 1 --- i. * Busselton Jetty, Western Australia Lap 1 ne --- Page 256 Text --- swim as well as you expect in open water then investing in a GPS watch and wearing it under your swim cap could be exactly what you need to find out what’s going wrong. For Dan discovering this and gaining the motivation to improve this aspect of his swimming was worth a massive 10 minutes over 1.9 km! Let’s take a look at some of the tactics Dan used to prepare more specifically for open water swimming: 1. Avoiding Crossovers As discussed in Chapter 10 of this book, crossing over in front of your head as your hand enters into the water is an extremely common stroke flaw; in open water that crossover pulls you constantly off course. Crossovers are normally at their worst when breathing as your thoughts are simply about getting in air and you forget your stroke alignment, so it is no coincidence that most swimmers go off course when breathing. Without the constraints of the pool lanes and a black line to follow you can be pulled a long way off line and add considerable distance to your swim. Use the side kicking drills and visualisation in Appendix A to improve your swimming posture and alignment in the water. Also shift your focus when breathing back to the alignment of your lead hand; to do this you might count each stroke by repeating to yourself ‘1-2- straight-1-2-straight’ where the word ‘straight’

side kicking drills and visualisation in Appendix A to improve your swimming posture and alignment in the water. Also shift your focus when breathing back to the alignment of your lead hand; to do this you might count each stroke by repeating to yourself ‘1-2- straight-1-2-straight’ where the word ‘straight’ coincides with your breathing stroke. 2. Bilateral Breathing and Frequency of Sighting We are big fans of bilateral breathing at Swim Smooth for the simple reason that it naturally helps maintain the symmetry of your stroke and so helps you swim straighter in open water. Even if you only treat bilateral breathing as a training practice you then have the choice of either side to breathe to unilaterally whilst racing. We have heard some swimming coaches state that you should only ever breathe to one side in open water as this gives you a greater oxygen uptake. This makes sense, however, usually the reason swimmers start to feel starved of oxygen is due to the fact that they are not exhaling properly into the water between breaths. By improving their exhalation such swimmers find it much easier to breathe bilaterally even at racing levels of effort. Also, as we mentioned earlier, holding onto your breath is never a good idea as it can bring on anxiety attacks followed by hyperventilation. Sighting technique sequence: lift your head just enough to sight forwards and then breathe to the side. --- Page 257 Text --- Many unilateral breathers accept the fact that they might lose stroke symmetry and swim off course as a result; to counter this they sight forwards more frequently to correct their course. The problem with this solution is that sighting carries an energy cost of its own as you have to lift your head to breathe which sinks your

might lose stroke symmetry and swim off course as a result; to counter this they sight forwards more frequently to correct their course. The problem with this solution is that sighting carries an energy cost of its own as you have to lift your head to breathe which sinks your legs downward even in a wetsuit. In an ideal world every swimmer would be able to swim so straight that they would never have to sight but everyone is eventually moved off course slightly by waves, current and even other swimmers. The key point here is that the less often you need to sight the faster you will swim and the best pathway to swimming straighter is bilateral breathing. --- Page 258 Text --- ADAM: You can experiment with keeping your eyes closed in a safe open water environment or an empty pool without lane ropes to see how straight you can swim. The furthest you can travel without moving off course is the answer to how often you should be sighting, give or take a few strokes – at least in calm conditions! Take caution when attempting this though, as hitting an object in the water when swimming can be potentially injurious! Another way of performing a similar exercise is to have your eyes closed when your head is down but then open your eyes whenever you go to sight forwards. This can help to simulate the sensation of swimming in murky water conditions. 3. Minimal Head Lift When Sighting Every swimmer needs to sight forwards in order to stay straight but developing the movement and timing of their sighting technique is something very few people practise regularly. The most common mistake to make when sighting forwards is to lift your whole face out of the water and try

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
ADAM: The other Swim Smooth coaches and I refer to something called the ‘Lane 1 Magneto Effect’. This is where the lane one swimmers in our squads gravitate towards each other despite us setting them off at 5 or 10 second intervals. Normally within 100 m-200 m of any set they are all circulating round as one big group in the lane! They have intuitively learned that there’s a distinct advantage to swimming close behind another swimmer and at the start of any swim put in a big effort to catch the person in front. 2. To the Side and Within the Wake of a Faster Swimmer Each swimmer creates a V-shaped wake when they move forwards in the water, the size of this wake will be determined by the size of the athlete and also their speed. By sitting to one side of the swimmer, positioned so that your head is somewhere between their hips and chest, you will be within this wake and can experience a very powerful drafting effect. The key to this skill is to be able to adjust your stroke rhythm so as to synchronise your stroke timing with theirs. This is important otherwise your arms will clash and both of you will become frustrated. A more technical way to draft is close to the side of the lead swimmer, within their wake. From the perspective of breathing easily it would make sense to breathe away from the person you are drafting so that you’re breathing into undisturbed water. --- Page 265 Text --- Unfortunately, doing this tends to pull you wide of the other swimmer, which can easily drop you out of the draft zone and lose you all the benefit of it. For this reason the golden rule is to always breathe in

breathing into undisturbed water. --- Page 265 Text --- Unfortunately, doing this tends to pull you wide of the other swimmer, which can easily drop you out of the draft zone and lose you all the benefit of it. For this reason the golden rule is to always breathe in towards the stronger swimmer even if this makes breathing itself slightly harder. This is one occasion where unilateral breathing (breathing to one side only) is advantageous to you. Of course you still need the ability to breathe to either side so that you can draft on either side of a swimmer as opportunities present themselves during a race. The perfect way to train in open water is by taking a coached skills session like this Swim Smooth one in Perth. A further advantage of drafting alongside another swimmer in this manner is that should you start to get dropped you can move directly behind to jump onto their feet, providing you with a very useful lifeline. PAUL: You will encounter situations in races where you are drafting another swimmer and feel that the pace is too easy for you. Before trying to break free by yourself, contemplate how much benefit you might be gaining from the draft and if this could explain why it feels quite slow. Often moving out of the draft and going solo becomes a shock as the extra effort of swimming by yourself suddenly catches up with you. You might also finish the swim and find the swimmer you overtook happily swimming on your toes! If you are really in a group of swimmers that are too slow for you then you will need to break free and swim solo but a better strategy might have been to start slightly quicker to find a better group

waters here in Perth and have found them to be amazingly quick. If your budget will stretch to one we’d highly recommend them for warm water swims. --- Page 275 Text --- CHAPTER 39 Adapting Your Stroke to a Variety of Conditions PAUL: In February 2011 I took a group of our Swim Smooth Perth squad swimmers down to the 4 km Busselton Jetty Swim, a three hour drive south of Perth. This is one of the most popular open water swims on the calendar and conditions are usually relatively flat. The Busselton Jetty is the longest jetty in the southern hemisphere and extends just under 2 km out to sea with a slight kink in the middle. Navigation in this event is relatively simple – keep the jetty on your left side all the way out to the end, swim round the very end of the jetty before returning on the other side, still keeping the jetty on your left. Simple. On this particular year though a strong wind had stirred the Indian Ocean up considerably with a significant swell running from right to left across the course as you looked out to sea. It made for extremely challenging conditions such that it was nearly impossible to breathe to the right on the outward leg and equally impossible to breathe to the left on the return leg. Attempting to breathe towards the direction of the oncoming swell resulted in a nasty mouthful of salty water! Those swimmers unable to adapt their breathing patterns were at a severe disadvantage, which saw over 60% of the field withdraw from the race. Just three days before the event I had set a training session for my swimmers of 15 × 100 m with 20 seconds rest between each. The goal was to

adapt their breathing patterns were at a severe disadvantage, which saw over 60% of the field withdraw from the race. Just three days before the event I had set a training session for my swimmers of 15 × 100 m with 20 seconds rest between each. The goal was to hold their best maintainable pace for the whole set. This set is nothing new or unique and all the swimmers had performed this sort of set before. What we did do though was instruct all the swimmers that they must only breathe to their left for the first five repetitions, only to their right for the next five repetitions and finally bilaterally (every three strokes to both sides) for the last five repetitions. Looking at the weather forecast it was my belief that the conditions down in Busselton could prove challenging and I didn’t want to risk the old adage of ‘failing to plan is planning to fail’. During the set the swimmers monitored their times per 100 m for each of the three breathing patterns to identify how much faster and more comfortable they were on one side versus the other. What was very interesting was that whilst for some breathing to their weaker side felt unusual, the time differential to their stronger side was much smaller than anticipated. This simply showed the swimmers that if they had to breathe to their non- dominant side because of conditions, they wouldn’t lose much or any time in doing so. This was a great confidence booster to them when they got in the water on race day. I’m very pleased to report that of the 34 squad members who raced from our team, not a single person pulled out of the event and of the 1000+ entrants we claimed three top-10

6-1-6 challenges you to maintain your hand positions and posture during the arm stroke. It’s common to see swimmers crossover or drop their elbow as the new hand enters the water and then immediately correct themselves. Instead of doing this, aim to enter straight into the correct position by maintaining your posture during the stroke. A good indication that you are doing this right is in how straight you are able to track down the pool. Over-Rotation With side-kicking drills you may feel unstable on your side as if you are going to topple onto your back. If your lead hand is not crossing over in front of your head then the cause is likely to be that you are slightly over-rotated beyond 90°. To improve this, bring your resting hand towards the front of the thigh as if it is in a jeans pocket. That should help you regain your balance. It’s worth highlighting that whilst these drills bring you to 90° of rotation, in your normal stroke we are looking for 45–60°. The drills emphasise the rotataion with the --- Page 296 Text --- view that you will transfer some of it into your full stroke. 6-3-6 As a further progression to 6-1-6, kick on the side for six kicks before performing three strokes, each nearly catching up in front of your head. Perform each stroke with perfect alignment and a great catch set-up position - fingertips below wrist and wrist below elbow. If you can, breathe immediately after the three strokes: 6-3-breathe-6. If that’s too little breathing, add in a breath during the arm strokes as well. Middle Finger Visualisation A useful visualisation whilst side kicking, and during the arm strokes in 6-1-6 and 6-3- 6, is to think solely about the middle finger on your lead

or a priority for you right now. The Arnie: plenty of power, needs more control! --- Page 315 Text --- PAUL: As an Arnie you may feel impatient to become a strong swimmer but ironically that may be one of the things holding you back. You need to slow things down a touch and work on areas of your stroke technique at a slower pace. I often tell swimmers such as yourself to recognise that impatience and to ‘Tame The Arnie!’. You won’t have a problem speeding things back up in the long run but taking the time and patiently working on your stroke technique is so important for your progress. 1. Develop your exhalation technique using the Sink Down and Breathe - Bubble - Bubble - Breathe exercises, you are looking to exhale as if sighing into the water – it is not as easy as it sounds to let that air go! Try to relax and develop a real sense of calmness as you perform these exercises and with your swimming in general. You may be surprised at how relaxed you can become whilst swimming. 2. Improve your breathing technique by keeping your head lower as you swim using the bow wave, Popeye Breathing and Split Screen visualisations. Refer to Chapter 7 for more information. 3. Tune up your kicking technique using the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick and Swim Back exercises. These may seem overly simple but they can make a huge difference to your body position and so your drag profile in the water. As you swim after these drills become aware of how high your legs are in the water, you are looking to feel your ankles gently breaking the surface but do not do that by bending at the knees!

The Bambino: more confidence and a better ‘feel for the water’ is required! --- Page 318 Text --- 1. Develop your exhalation technique by using the Sink Down and Breathe - Bubble - Bubble - Breathe exercises listed in Appendix A. This is critical for your stroke because a build-up of CO in your system will make swimming feel much 2 more tense than it needs to be. Exhale smoothly into the water with a relaxed sigh – If you have ever done any yoga you will understand how powerful this can be for your relaxation. As you start swimming use the breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe mantra to help coordinate bilateral breathing and exhalation together. Do not worry if the breath itself still feels a struggle, we will come to that later. 2. Tune up your kicking technique using the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick and Swim Back exercises. A relaxed flutter kick that comes from the hip (not the knee) will burn less oxygen and bring your legs up higher in the water, creating less drag. You’re not looking to kick hard in your swimming so make sure that your kick is just light enough to bring your legs up so that your ankles break the surface. 3. Tune in to good stroke timing using the Kick On Side and then 6-1-6 drills. These may feel quite strange and hard to coordinate at first but that’s OK. A weak point in a Bambino’s stroke is that their lead arm slips down in the water when breathing, when in fact it should be out in front of the head offering support. As you perform the 6-1-6 drill you may find that the

coordinate at first but that’s OK. A weak point in a Bambino’s stroke is that their lead arm slips down in the water when breathing, when in fact it should be out in front of the head offering support. As you perform the 6-1-6 drill you may find that the lead arm wants to collapse down as the top arm comes over during the arm stroke. If this happens practise using a Vitamin tube as a relay baton, as described in Appendix A. Move on to 6-3-6, all the time catching up for the moment with your arms in front of your head. You should immediately notice more support when breathing. Developing a good exhalation technique is critical to helping you relax in the water. 4. Reinforce your stroke timing by repeating the 1-2-stretch mantra to yourself as you swim. The 1 and 2 being on normal strokes and the stretch on a breathing stroke, this will help to remind you to keep that lead hand out in front of you for support whilst breathing. You should be able to let your breath take care of itself whilst you think about keeping that lead hand stable. --- Page 319 Text --- 5. Work on your head position whilst breathing using the Popeye Breathing and Split Screen visualisation described in Chapter 7. You are aiming to keep your head low in the water and breathe into the bow-wave trough. If you have tried this before it will be much more achievable now that we have improved your stroke timing in steps 3 and 4. 6. Develop a basic ‘feel for the water’ using the Scull #1 drill.

sense of rhythm will benefit your stroke. Kicktastic Stroke Correction Process If you are a Kicktastic, use the following process to develop your swimming. The main feature is in step 4 where we develop your catch and ‘feel for the water’. As you make the shift to upper-body propulsion you should find that the reliance on your leg kick naturally starts to drop away. 1. Tune up your exhalation technique using the Sink Down and Breathe - Bubble - Bubble - Breathe exercises in Appendix A. Despite being quite experienced swimmers, many Kicktastics hold their breath under the water, which makes swimming much harder than it needs to be. Developing your ability to breathe out smoothly into the water will make swimming feel easier and give you more time when you do go to take a breath as you will only have to inhale, not exhale and inhale in the same short window! Many Kicktastics returning to swimming after years off from the sport feel that they never regain their swimming fitness. However, this can simply be due to poor exhalation technique and essentially turning what should be a very aerobic activity into something much more anaerobic by never releasing the build-up of CO in their system. 2 --- Page 320 Text --- The Kicktastic: a better catch and ‘feel for the water’ will allow them to moderate their kick. 2. Give your kicking technique a once over using the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick and Swim Back exercises. Despite having powerful leg kicks, many Kicktastics kick hard from the knee rather than kicking with a relatively straight leg from the hip. Developing an improved kicking technique will reduce the oxygen demand from the kick, making breathing much easier. 3. Work on improving posture and rotation using the Kick

investment in your swimming, especially if you train outside of a squad. Use it to control and monitor your stroke rate as you continue to refine your catch technique and stroke timing. 8. Experiment with a light 6-beat flutter kick if you do not use one already. Although a 2-beat kick uses less energy it naturally suits a shorter faster stroke style, not a long smooth one. Depending on your natural buoyancy you may find that your body position is higher in the water with a light 6-beat flutter kick. This will create less drag and lower your energy expenditure overall despite the extra kicking. Swinger Stroke Correction Process If you are a Swinger follow the process outlined below and refer to the relevant sections of this book to develop your swimming. 1. Brush up on your exhalation technique into the water using the Sink Down and Breathe - Bubble - Bubble - Breathe exercises listed in Appendix A. Despite being experienced swimmers, Swingers are some of the worst culprits when it comes to holding their breath underwater. It’s possible that their fast stroke rate lets them get away with this more than other types since their breathing comes around quicker. However, by improving your breathing technique you’ll feel much more relaxed in the water and might be able to move to breathing every five strokes rather than three. Breathing less often is always an advantage as all swimmers lose stroke efficiency when breathing. The Swinger: experienced swimmer with excellent stroke rhythm who needs a tune-up. --- Page 326 Text --- 2. Work on improving posture and alignment in the water using the Kick On Side and then 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills.

technique a tune-up using the Sink Down exercise in Appendix A. Despite your experience as a swimmer, the chances are that your exhalation is not what it could be. This won’t be hard for you to improve but you will need to constantly remind yourself to exhale smoothly and efficiently into the water whilst you develop the habit. The Smooth: the envy of the pool but may need to adapt their stroke for high- performance in open water. --- Page 329 Text --- 2. Give your posture and alignment in the water a once-over using the Kick On Side and then 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills. As a Smooth this should be a strong area of yours but it is worth becoming aware of the importance of good posture in swimming. As we all get older we lose our natural flexibility so a little on-going maintenance in this area is well advised. If you have only been breathing to one side (see Chapter 7 and steps 4 and 5 below) then this is going to be important to you as you might have become a little lopsided in your stroke from doing so. Pay particular attention to your catch set-up position here using a slightly cocked wrist set-up with the fingertips lower than the wrist. This will help you initiate the catch effectively and help you to develop your ‘feel for the water’. 3. Revisit your catch mechanics using the Scull #1 and Doggy Paddle drills. You are probably familiar with these or similar exercises from your youth but might not have tried them in a while or focused on the right areas when doing so. We are looking to reignite your ‘feel for the water’, which will have already been assisted by an improved catch set-up from step 2. If

Sport of Swimming than resolutely resisting you in the way that a solid does. Similarly, speed in swim- ming comes not necessarily from moving your body parts faster but from using your movements to put pressure on the water in an effective manner. As anyone who has participated in water aerobics can attest, you can work awfully hard in the water yet go nowhere. Swimming also changes the priorities typically placed on the human senses, as well as the feedback they provide. On land, much of our typical interaction with our environment revolves around the senses of sight and hearing. Underwater, however, both of these senses are diminished and therefore often take a backseat to the sense of touch, or “feel.” Of course, one component of this sensory feedback involves water temperature, which can greatly affect one’s comfort and enjoyment when swimming. In addition, both very cold water and very hot water both pose health risks. Specifically, water temperatures below 72 degrees Fahrenheit (about 22 degrees Celsius) or above 92 degrees Fahrenheit (about 33 degrees Celsius) require special caution because they make for an uncomfortable learning environment. Last—and this is perhaps the most striking difference between swimming and other sports—one must purposefully address the question of when (and where) to breathe. In most other sports, breathing happens without much conscious thought. In swimming, however, breathing is often a primary focus because inhaling water is not a pleasant experience. As a result, many swimmers feel that they must take a big gulp of air and then hold their breath for as long as they can while swimming. This approach typically leads to a bad experience, such as hyperventilating or even concluding that swimming is just too hard and giving up altogether. Each of these defining characteristics of swimming is discussed in

water (figure 1.4). You can try this first exercise while holding your breath. One indicator of success is being able to look straight down at the bottom of the pool while relaxing on the water in a horizontal position with your back straight. After you become comforta- ble in this position, try it again—only this time breathe out slowly. Breath holding causes tension, which can lead a swimmer to sink or struggle with balance; exhaling slowly, on the other hand, aids relaxation and is also a necessary skill for performing the competitive strokes. To control your breathing, rather than exhaling forcefully, breathe out through your nose while humming. 8 --- Page 28 Text --- Floating Figure 1.4 FronT FloaTing WiTh arms exTended Preparation Execution 1.

It is not designed to have swimmers hold their breath. The numbers (3, 5, 3, 7) indicate how many strokes you should take between breaths per 25 yards. In other words, for the first 25 yards, breathe every three strokes; for the second 25, breathe every five strokes, and so on. This drill is challenging even when done slowly and with effective movements, and the odd numbers cause an alternating of the breathing pattern. This alternat- ing pattern is a great skill to have, especially for racers, triathletes, and open-water swimmers. It helps with having a faster breathing rate at higher workload levels, and it can aid in navigation for open-water swimmers.

Many swim- mers find it effective to breathe in through the mouth and exhale through the nose. This way, if water is drawn toward your face and falls into your mouth, you can expel or swallow it, which most people find preferable to inhaling it through the nose. In addition, the technique helps many swimmers with control, rhythm, and timing. Since swimming is a rhythmic motion, synchronizing all of the motions of the body including breathing makes for good swimming. Most people can establish a good breathing rhythm after just a little practice. Complete the following to practice backstroke breathing. PreParation 1. Push off of the wall and begin your armstrokes. execution 1. While stroking with your arms, practice exhaling when one arm is pulling and inhaling when the other arm is pulling. MissTep You swallow a bunch of water when trying to breathe. correcTion Are you flat or rotating? Rotate each time, with your recovering side out of the water. MissTep Your hips sink every time you breathe. correcTion Are your hands stopping and meeting at your hips? A good oppo- site-hands rhythm prevents a lot of the stalling encountered by many swimmers.

They also inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose. If you have ever gotten water up your nose while swimming the backstroke, you know that it is not a pleasant experience. Make sure that you have the breathing pattern down by following these instructions. Ensure that the lane is clear. Ensure that backstroke flags are in place. Push off in the streamlined position. As you break the surface, exhale through your nose. Choose which arm is your inhale arm and which is your exhale arm. Start slowly and breathe in through your mouth on one armstroke and out through your nose on the opposite armstroke. Experiment to find out which pattern works best for you.

BreaThinG One of the many advantages of the breaststroke is that you can breathe on every stroke. The exact timing of this breath is an important part of the rhythm of the breast- stroke (figure 5.3). As a result, before you start to put it all together for a complete breaststroke, it is a good idea to practice your breathing in isolation. While perform- ing the following drills, lift your head to breathe; the key is to do so at the right time and in the right manner. With the other pressures of laminar flow of water against the chest providing lift on the water, this movement should be sufficient to get your mouth and nose out of the water. Some swimmers will be higher and others lower; it is very specific to each swimmer. 107 --- Page 127 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 5.3 BreasTsTroke BreaThinG Preparation 1. Lie on

you perform all elements of the stroke, except that when you finish the stroke you sweep your hands and arms forward and out to the sides, near the surface of the water but still in it. Start with your hands and arms extended out front and lie on the water in the neutral position. Do a dolphin kick, both up and down, as well as a catch and pull. As you finish the pull, sweep your hands and arms out in a semicircular motion with your arms straight. It is okay for your arms to skim the surface of the water.

To do it, perform one pull for every four dolphin kicks. This technique isolates your hand positioning upon entry and immediately afterward. Lay your hands on the water directly in front of you so that your arms are above the head in an outstretched position like that of Superman when flying. Perform four dolphin kicks to continue moving forward while adjusting your hands and arms if necessary. If you find yourself having to lift your head and pitch your hands up to get back to the stretched-out position, you are driving the stroke too much with your upper body. Instead, think of laying your hands on the water and landing on your armpits. Remember to breathe only in the beginning part of the stroke. To increase DiFFiculTY • Speed up the rhythm. To Decrease DiFFiculTY • Use fins.
