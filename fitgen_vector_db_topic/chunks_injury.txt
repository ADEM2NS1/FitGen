After all, we use our bodies from head to toe to perform our sport. The complex system of muscles that weaves together over our frames allows us to do the quick, explosive movements, and the long, repetitious movements that make up swimming. Our muscles work in tandem to make it possible to perform tasks as simple as putting on goggles and as lofty as winning Olympic gold. Yet, when we see a fantastic swimmer moving through the water with grace and speed, we don’t associate their speed with muscular strength. Instead we associate it

by swimmers, we see that, without a doubt, competitive swimming provides some of the best cardiovascular fitness of any sport. The full body requirements and repetitive nature of our sport promotes high levels of aerobic capacity and cardiovascular efficiency, much like runners and cyclists possess, but with the added requirement of propelling ourselves through a medium thicker than air. Swimming also requires mastery of breathing timing (more so than any other sport). Whereas on land, athletes have no restrictions on breathing, in swimming getting new air is limited to the time when the face is out of the water, ultimately boosting fitness even further. 13 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 13 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 16 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Swimmers are also very flexible, and in many cases, almost too flexible. The loose joints (especially in the shoulders) that enable a swimmer to reach and stroke effectively, and move so fluidly can also allow the bones to move around at the joint, causing inflammation and pain. The only area where swimmers often lack enough flexibility is at the ankle, where it is desirable to have the ability to easily point the toes and create a straight line to the knee. Still, among land athletes, only ballet dancers have better ankle flexibility than swimmers. Swimmers are very coordinated, as well. The complex nature of swimming uses every part of the body to move forward in a series of movements within each stroke cycle, encouraging an intuitive understanding of the kinetic chain. And, in what other sport does the athlete propel himself or herself at full speed toward a wall, then tuck and reverse directions without slowing down? Finally, we come to strength, the final measure of athletic condition. As we compare the strength developed by swimmers with the strength

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
strength training builds useable strength for swimmers. A training routine that combines swimming and strength work on land gives swimmers an edge over water-based training alone. 17 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 17 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 20 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming MORE BENEFITS OF STRENGTH TRAINING While the primary objective for swimmers engaged in land-based strength training is to build more speed in the water, there are additional benefits as well. INJURY PREVENTION Strength training is one of the most proactive steps a swimmer can take to prevent injuries, especially to the shoulders. The recognizable physique of a swimmer features large shoulders and a well-developed upper body, but is often punctuated by poor posture. The shortened chest muscles and lengthened back muscles developed by swimmers can result in posture imbalance, often accompanied by shoulders that drop forward, and are sometimes internally rotated. Long-term swimming with this posture can lead to inflammation around the shoulders and pain when the bones are not held firmly in place on all sides. Eventually, if not corrected, such an imbalance can lead to injury that can take a swimmer out of action. Strength training can correct imbalances by targeting the stabilizing muscles around the shoulder joints. Posture can also be improved by targeting the muscles of the upper back. Balanced strength and better posture help a swimmer remain injury free. 18 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 18 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 21 Text --- What Makes Swimmers Fast? TRAINING TIME MANAGEMENT Another benefit of strength training is the management of training time. Limitations on water time, as well as limits on the productive swimming a person can be expected to do in one session can lead to training content deficiencies. As we try to include every training element into our limited water time, we may

through the body, passing from one muscle group to another throughout each stroke cycle, producing efficient forward motion. Often referred to as the kinetic chain, this connected movement is what a swimmer should strive to simulate in strength training. Rather than isolating one muscle, consider that that muscle is just part of a larger movement. Imagine a baseball player standing at bat. His arms support the bat, but when he swings to hit the ball, not only will the muscles of his arms come into play but he will employ the muscles in his shoulders, chest, abdomen, 33 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 33 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 36 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming upper and lower back, and legs in one connected motion to send the ball flying fast and far. If instead he used the muscles in his arms in isolation, even with all his strength, the velocity and trajectory of the ball would land it at the pitcher’s feet. It is the same with swimming. An effective swimmer throws his or her body into each stroke, employing not only the muscles of the arms but those in the shoulders, chest, abdomen, upper and lower back, and legs to produce a connected motion with each stroke that moves the body farther and faster, and with less fatigue, than if the arms were used in isolation. An ineffective swimmer moves his or her arms and legs independently of each other, expending a great deal of effort to basically perform four separate actions, rather than one connected action. Linking the muscles together in coordinated movement allows the swimmer to produce better forward motion with less effort. For this reason, strength training for swimmers should involve multiple muscle groups, to simulate swimming motion as much as possible, rather than training muscles

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
tension, the effect that is produced is not forward motion as desired but a fishtailing or bobbing movement. Muscles are often categorized as movers and stabilizers. While some muscles serve exclusively as stabilizers, many muscles actually perform both functions. It is the larger surface layer muscles of the core and limbs that can act both as both movers and stabilizers as the body goes through the series of stroke actions that make up swimming. There are several examples of this dual function in swimming. THE TRAPEzIUS The trapezius muscle is the large muscle of the upper back that connects the neck and the shoulders and the back. The trapezius moves and rotates the shoulders and neck, as well as stabilizes the shoulder blades and upper body. In freestyle, the trapezius is engaged as a primary mover during breathing as the head turns for the inhale, and during recovery, as the arm moves back to the beginning of the stroke. It also serves as a stabilizer assisting the swimmer in maintaining 35 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 35 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 38 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming a positive floating position throughout the entire stroke action. When a swimmer presses his or her chest down to achieve the “downhill” floating position, the shoulder blades move closer together. The trapezius is employed in achieving and holding this position. THE OBLIQUES The obliques are bilateral abdominal muscles located at either side of the “six pack.” The function of the obliques is to assist in rotation and sideways stabilization of the body. In freestyle and backstroke, the obliques act in partnership, one as a mover and one as a stabilizer, to produce the pendulum- like roll that provides leverage to the arm stroke. As the swimmer rolls into the stroke, the oblique muscle

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
assist in rotation and sideways stabilization of the body. In freestyle and backstroke, the obliques act in partnership, one as a mover and one as a stabilizer, to produce the pendulum- like roll that provides leverage to the arm stroke. As the swimmer rolls into the stroke, the oblique muscle on the opposite side acts as the primary moving muscle, while the oblique on the same side works to stabilize the core and hips. As the leading arm changes, so does the function of the obliques. THE DELTOIDS The deltoids are the bilateral muscles that cover the shoulders. The function of the deltoids is to lift and assist with rotation of the arm. In butterfly, freestyle and backstroke, where the arm recovers out of the water, the deltoids act as primary movers to lift and return the arm to the beginning of the stroke. However, during the power phase of the stroke, the deltoids serve as stabilizers to the shoulder as the arm sweeps through the three-dimensional path of the underwater stroke. 36 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 36 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 39 Text --- The Swimming Muscles THE QUADRICEPS The quadriceps are the large and powerful four-part muscles located in the front of the thigh. The function of the quads is to straighten the leg from the hip to the knee and to provide stability to the lower body and knee. In flutter and dolphin kick, the quads are the primary movers as they drive the legs downward for the powerful downbeat of the kick. However, during the upbeat, they serve as knee stabilizers, keeping it from hyper-extending. Strength training should address both moving and stabilizing. Because the stabilizing effect is more subtle, often strength-building efforts focus on the moving function and ignore the stabilizing function. The importance of self-

should be a main priority of any strength training program for swimmers. Strengthening the core involves targeting a series of muscles that work together to create a better foundation to swim from. These muscles are listed below. FRONT CORE MUSCLES The front core muscles include the abdominals, most visibly the rectus abdominus, commonly known as the “six-pack,” which allows forward and backward bending, and provides stability to the core, especially in the horizontal position. Located at either side of the rectus abdominus are the obliques, which assist and stabilize rotation, an important action in long axis strokes. Finally, the major muscles of the chest are the pectoralis major, which are important movers of the arm, especially during the catch and in the beginning of the power phase of all strokes. They also act as stabilizers to the shoulders. Just below the pectoralis major are the serratus anterior, named for their serrated appearance as they cover a portion of the first eight ribs. The function of these muscles is to help raise the shoulder blades, and stabilize the frontal and overhead motions that we use in swimming.

The lats run bilaterally over the length of the back, from under each arm to the waist, and wrap around the swimmer’s sides. The trapezius muscle connects the neck to the shoulders and back. It enables a variety of movements including raising and lowering the arm,

highly developed by swimming. The lats run bilaterally over the length of the back, from under each arm to the waist, and wrap around the swimmer’s sides. The trapezius muscle connects the neck to the shoulders and back. It enables a variety of movements including raising and lowering the arm, rotation, turning the head and lifting the shoulders, as well as stabilizing these actions. This is a crucial muscle to maintain as it affects posture and shoulder position. The rhomboids, which are located in the upper back underneath the trapezius, assist in pulling and posture by moving the shoulder blades closer together. Also under the surface layer of muscles in the upper back are the teres major and teres minor muscles. Teres major assists in pulling the shoulders back and rotating the arms outwardly. Teres minor are part of a group of shoulder stabilizing muscles called the rotator cuff. They stabilize internal rotation of the arm. Trapezius Rhomboids Teres Minor Latisimus Dorsi Teres Major 41 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 41 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 44 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming UNDER THE SURFACE The human body is wrapped with several layers of muscles. It is tempting to target solely the muscles we see, and while these surface-layer muscles are key to producing forward motion in swimming, what lies underneath them is equally important. The function of the underlying muscles is largely to provide stability to the bones at the joints. In swimming, the joints that get the most use are located in the shoulders. In swimming, we reach, extend and align with our shoulders, use them to apply resistance to the water on multiple planes, and we use them to throw our arms forward to do it all over again. While the extraordinary shoulder enables all of these motions,

are located in the shoulders. In swimming, we reach, extend and align with our shoulders, use them to apply resistance to the water on multiple planes, and we use them to throw our arms forward to do it all over again. While the extraordinary shoulder enables all of these motions, swimming puts a lot of demand on them. Therefore, taking care of our shoulders should be a priority. Just like a race car designed to perform, to ensure that it is ready to work at an optimal level, regular maintenance of its systems is key. Likewise, our shoulders are so crucial to swimming that maintaining them is just as important. We must both understand their parts and attend to their mechanisms. Shoulder maintenance should be considered a regular part of a strength training program. We must strengthen them from the inside out. The shoulder has two joints. The first, commonly known as the shoulder joint, lies under the visible deltoid muscle. This joint allows the extensive rotation of the arm that is so basic to swimming. It is a ball and socket type joint, located where the top of the arm bone meets the shoulder blade. Resembling a golf tee, the end of the arm bone sits on top of a shallow socket in the shoulder blade. The remarkable range of motion allowed by this joint ironically makes it vulnerable to instability. The “ball” is held in place on the “tee” directly by four small muscles that surround the joint, stabilizing it during motion. These muscles together are called the rotator cuff. 42 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 42 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 45 Text --- The Swimming Muscles ROTATOR CUFF The four muscles of the rotator cuff each have different functions: Supraspinatus — stabilizes movement of the arm up and away

stabilizing it during motion. These muscles together are called the rotator cuff. 42 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 42 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 45 Text --- The Swimming Muscles ROTATOR CUFF The four muscles of the rotator cuff each have different functions: Supraspinatus — stabilizes movement of the arm up and away from the body Subscapularis — stabilizes internal arm rotation Infraspinatus — stabilizes external arm rotation Teres minor — stabilizes internal arm rotation and lifting of the arm When one or more of the rotator cuff muscles is weak, damaged, or develops unevenly, the bones are not held stable and can move around in the joint, leading to inflammation of the surrounding tissues and shoulder pain. In swimmers, poor stroke technique, overuse, or other muscular imbalances can all contribute to rotator cuff problems. But even when these factors are identified and corrected, it is necessary to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles before the shoulder joint can regain stability and perform correctly. SCAPULAE REGION The second joint of the shoulder is located at the intersection of the clavicle, commonly known as the collarbone, and the top of the scapulae, commonly known as the shoulder blade. This joint performs like a hinge for the shoulder blade. The shoulder blade enables the overhead motions we use in every swimming stroke. Like the shoulder joint, the job of the shoulder blade is to allow extensive motion. To facilitate this, it is held in place only by the muscles, in contrast to most other joints in the body, which also have tendons and ligaments to support them. When a swimmer has poor posture, weak back muscles or overly developed chest muscles, the shoulder blades can move out of place. The unstable shoulder blade slides upward, tipping out from the back at the lower edge of the

the body, which also have tendons and ligaments to support them. When a swimmer has poor posture, weak back muscles or overly developed chest muscles, the shoulder blades can move out of place. The unstable shoulder blade slides upward, tipping out from the back at the lower edge of the bone and tipping into the adjacent structures at the top of the bone. In some swimmers, this condition is visible when looking at the back. 43 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 43 12.07.11 12:12 --- OCR from Page 45 Image 1 --- Supraspinatous Muscle Clavicle Humerus Subscapularis Scapula FRONT VIEW Supraspinatous Muscle Clavicle Humerus Infraspinatous Muscle Teres Minor Muscle BACK VIEW --- Page 46 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming One or both of the shoulder blades stick out, away from the body (like wings) and appear to be higher that usual. When the joint continues to do its job, including repeated swimming motions from this wrong position, it can affect the rotator cuff muscles, causing pain. While the rotator cuff is the site of the pain, the cause is instability of the shoulder blade. Although most swimmers with shoulder pain are diagnosed with rotator cuff problems, many physical therapists agree that the primary and underlying cause of all shoulder problems in swimmers is instability of the shoulder blade. Ongoing work to strengthen the muscles that stabilize the shoulder blade should therefore be a priority. By strengthening the stabilizing muscles that support both shoulder joints, a swimmer can prevent the most common swimming-related health problems. If a swimmer’s shoulder does become painful, rest, as well as targeted strengthening exercises of the shoulder stabilizers, should be part of the recovery process. 44 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 44 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 47 Text --- The Swimming Muscles KEY MUSCLES FOR CERTAIN STROKES We

common swimming-related health problems. If a swimmer’s shoulder does become painful, rest, as well as targeted strengthening exercises of the shoulder stabilizers, should be part of the recovery process. 44 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 44 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 47 Text --- The Swimming Muscles KEY MUSCLES FOR CERTAIN STROKES We want to think in terms of multi-muscle swimming movements as much as possible, however because the pull pattern, kicking action, leverage and balance requirements in each of the four competitive swimming strokes is unique, we must consider which muscles are especially important to each stroke. BUTTERFLY The wide bilateral recovery of the butterfly places a demand on the trapezius unlike any other stroke. In addition, the initial movements of the power phase are done when the swimmer’s body is lower than the chest, requiring the pectoralis major to engage in a distinct lifting action. Finally, as the dolphin kick places the hips in a higher position relative to the body than in other strokes, the gluteus maximus comes into play. Key Butterfly Muscles 45 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 45 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 48 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming BACKSTROKE To achieve the ideal body position in backstroke, the pelvis must be tilted Key Backstroke Muscles forward through abdominal contraction of the retus abdominus. The upward kick, against gravity also puts a large demand on the quads. The unique catch position, behind the head requires the rhomboids to contract heavily. Finally, the elongated push portion of the arm stroke engages the triceps more completely, and for a longer duration than in other strokes. BREASTSTROKE The unique requirements of the breaststroke kick engage several muscles that are not otherwise used much in swimming.

engages the triceps more completely, and for a longer duration than in other strokes. BREASTSTROKE The unique requirements of the breaststroke kick engage several muscles that are not otherwise used much in swimming. While the hamstrings are used to raise the heels, the hip flexors and abductors perform and stabilize the sweeping motion of the kick. As the foot position goes from completely feet flexed to completely pointed, the calf muscles are also heavily engaged. The abbreviated breaststroke arm stroke employs the biceps more so than the other strokes during the in-sweep of the Key Breaststroke Muscles 46 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 46 12.07.11 12:12 --- OCR from Page 48 Image 2 --- Key Backstroke Muscles --- OCR from Page 48 Image 4 --- Key Breaststroke Muscles --- Page 49 Text --- The Swimming Muscles stroke. Finally, the breaststroke’s underwater recovery employs the upper trapezius to shrug and roll the shoulders forward as the arms return to the extended position. FREESTYLE The three-dimensional sweeping pull pattern of the freestyle taxes the shoulders more than any other stroke. Rotator cuff muscles and muscles of the scapular region work overtime to stabilize the shoulders in freestyle, as the arms rotate from a high elbow position to the rear of the body during recovery to an extended position in front of the body during the power phase. Finally, the obliques serve as primary movers in freestyle to produce the corkscrew effect that sends power from the core to the upper and lower limbs.

core as well. While all strength training is based on resistance, each type of exercise presented provides a different kind of challenge to the muscles. Some types are appropriate for all swimmers, but some are appropriate only at more advanced stages of development and are noted as such. SELF-RESISTANCE Self-resistance refers to using the weight of one’s own body as the load. “Baby stuff!” you might say; far from it. Some of the most beneficial and challenging exercises for swimmers of all levels fall under this category. Self- resistance work, in fact, should be a part of all strength training programs, 59 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 59 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 62 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming as it resembles swimming very closely in terms of multi-muscle movements. Self-resistance work promotes core stability and balance, coordination and tempo. In addition, force, power, and explosiveness can all be developed very successfully with self-resistance work. Beneficial self-resistance activities include: FULL BODY Burpies — Stand, squat, extend legs, squat and stand. Repeat the sequence. Cartwheels — A gymnastics handspring where the body turns over sideways and back to the standing position with the arm and legs spread like the spokes of a cartwheel. Crab Walk — Walk on all four limbs with the back toward the ground. Crawling — Walk on hands and feet. 60 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 60 12.07.11 12:12 --- OCR from Page 62 Image 1 --- al --- OCR from Page 62 Image 2 --- ANI --- Page 63 Text --- Let’s Get Specific Speed Walking — As in the Olympic sport, a rapid heel to toe walking stride using leverage from the arms and core.

The traditional push-up, a mainstay of modern exercise and a standard measure of fitness level, does not appear among these recommended self- resistance exercises intentionally. Although countless push-ups are done regularly by pro-athletes, military recruits, and even Rocky, as part of their physical training routines, it is the belief of this coach that the push-up should not be part of a swimming strength training program. The push-up does not address swimming very well. It does not simulate swimming motion at all, as the direction of the resistance is perpendicular to the athlete’s body, rather than parallel. While the push-up does promote core and upper body strength, it also taxes the shoulders in ways that do not benefit swimming. Extensive push-ups can develop muscles that interfere with

While the push-up does promote core and upper body strength, it also taxes the shoulders in ways that do not benefit swimming. Extensive push-ups can develop muscles that interfere with a swimmer’s range of motion in the water, especially during arm extension. Further, the push-up shortens shoulder stabilizers and chest muscles where they already tend to be too short among swimmers. Activities that are less problematic for swimmers, that promote swimming- specific core and upper body strength better than the push-up, include the plank, side plank and corner push out. 69 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 69 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 72 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming SELF-RESISTANCE WITH ACCESSORIES Small accessories can be included to add complexity or challenge to self- resistance work.

training work. The medicine ball provides a compact external load in useful weights from 1 to 25 pounds. Even with this minor amount of added resistance, medicine balls are not recommended for swimmers in the earliest stages of development for two reasons. First, they are weights, and the bones of young athletes are not physically ready to support more than their own body weight. Second, although medicine balls may look like toys, and in many ways act like a regular ball (they can be tossed, rolled and caught), they must be handled as tools. They are heavy and, if dropped on a foot or thrown at someone’s face, they can cause injury. Medicine balls should be used only by athletes with the maturity to handle them carefully. There are many benefits of medicine ball training. It allows the swimmer to move through multiple planes, which simulates the movement used in swimming, unlike traditional weightlifting, which is done in a single plane. Medicine ball activities encourage the swimmer to develop both moving and stabilizing functions evenly as he or she must exert effort to move the ball and stabilize to control the ball. Medicine ball training also helps develop force and explosiveness very well, as the swimmer must react quickly to the weight of the ball when it comes toward him and when he sends it into flight. Finally, medicine ball training encourages coordination by using multi- muscle movements rather than isolated muscle efforts. Medicine balls can be used by an individual and, in some cases, with a partner. Beneficial activities for swimmers include: 77 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 77 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 80 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming FULL BODY Squat and Jump — Hold the ball with two hands at about the belly button level, squat, then

recommended only for athletes who have reached the young adult stage of development. Real consequences can occur when weights are used too early in a swimmer’s development. It is not a myth! Growth plates in young developing swimmers can be damaged under the load of weights. When a swimmer is physically ready for weights, they provide an efficient way to build muscle strength. Weight rooms are full of equipment and machines, some which address swimming and some that don’t. It is important to remember that we are trying to simulate swimming movement, directionality and tempo as much as possible. WEIGHT MACHINES Weight machines that use pulley systems generally address swimming movement in terms of directionality, range of motion, and by requiring accelerating movements. There are also machines that work on lever systems. Some of these are beneficial to swimmers. Some, however, apply resistance in the reverse direction of swimming, and others are designed to isolate muscles rather than to engage multi-muscle movements. Weight machines that are especially beneficial to swimmers include: 88 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 88 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 91 Text --- Let’s Get Specific UPPER BODY/ARMS Lat Pull — This machine has a wide bar suspended overhead from a cable and a pulley that attaches to an adjustable stack of weights at the other end below.

training develop better endurance, as swimming, which builds endurance very well, becomes an extension of a “super workout” begun on land, requiring the swimmer to adapt to a greater workload. On the other hand, some believe that since swimming elongates the muscles, strength work that follows swimming ensures that the swimmer’s muscles are well warmed up and less vulnerable to injury from the demands of land training. They also argue that when strength training follows the water workout, the quality of the swimming is higher because a swimmer who is tired after strength training practices swimming slower, with less force, power and explosiveness, reinforcing undesirable habits. Finally, many take the position that swimming first allows the swimmer to feel and utilize the strength that he or she has adapted to in the water where it counts. So which is best? There are valid arguments for both. From the perspective of preparing a swimmer to race, to be ready to perform under less than ideal conditions, including poor weather, crowded warm-up areas and meet delays, a program that uses a bit of both approaches should be considered. By mixing it up, the swimmer will practice adapting to different situations. Further, changing the order of the training routine from time to time will keep it from becoming boring, as the swimmer will stay challenged to perform under different circumstances. The final decision should be based on what best works for the individual athlete. 99 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 99 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 102 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Scheduling rest time is as important as scheduling workout time.

Rope 102 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 102 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 105 Text --- The Fundamentals TAKE IT EASY ON THE STRETCHING! Stretching has long been a traditional part of warming up before exercise, but the fact is, stretching has injured many swimmers. There are two reasons for this: 1. Stretching does not prepare the body to work, as a warm-up should do. By using valuable warm-up time for stretching, a swimmer runs out of time to do activities that raise the heart rate and activate the muscles. Beginning a workout in this state leaves the body more prone to injury. In addition, without a good warm-up, some or all of the workout is wasted because the swimmer is not prepared to exert. 2. In general, swimmers have very mobile joints, so stretching is really unnecessary. This is especially true of shoulder stretching. Because the shoulders are so central to swimming, they are commonly the site of soreness for many swimmers. In an effort to relieve soreness, we turn to stretching. But what happens when these muscles are stretched is that too much looseness develops, which can lead to joint stability problems during swimming, producing more soreness and pain. Instead of stretching as a warm-up, swimmers should spend warm-up time doing full-body activity with gradually progressive effort. As far as the shoulders, rather than stretching, the focus should be on stabilizing mobility at the joints to keep them operating correctly. This is done through specific shoulder stabilization exercises, as shown on page 94-95. If stretching is done at all, it should be done after exercise. It should be very conservative and target only the large muscles, not the joints. Even this kind of stretching should be gentle and gradual. Under no circumstances should any bouncing action be used.

Even this kind of stretching should be gentle and gradual. Under no circumstances should any bouncing action be used. Under no circumstances should another swimmer apply external stretching pressure for you. Under no circumstances should stretching hurt, either during or after you do it. 103 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 103 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 106 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming When exercise machines are available, warm-ups can include: • Exercise Bike • Elliptical Trainer • Treadmill COOL DOWN Just as after swimming, the cool down is important to let body systems and muscles adjust to the resting state. After exercise, allow several minutes of slow, continuous activity so the heart rate can return to normal and the muscles can begin to relax. One of the best cool down activities is walking. FORM Form is as important in strength training as it is in the water. Form determines the manner in which the swimmer’s body interacts with the resistance. It is important to spend time perfecting the swimmer’s form on any particular exercise before it is repeated over and over. Correct form ensures that the swimmer will use the intended muscles groups in the intended fashion. Incorrect form can lead to poor results, including injury. POSTURE Our symmetrical bodies are designed with many bilateral muscles, including the lats, the obliques, the pectoralis major and the deltoids, among others. However, when one part of our body is out of alignment, the mirror image muscles are very adept at taking over the work. Repeated exercise with poor posture can result in bilateral muscles developing unevenly as one side compensates for the other. As swimming

major and the deltoids, among others. However, when one part of our body is out of alignment, the mirror image muscles are very adept at taking over the work. Repeated exercise with poor posture can result in bilateral muscles developing unevenly as one side compensates for the other. As swimming depends on bilateral strength, maintaining good posture is very important. 104 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 104 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 107 Text --- The Fundamentals Good posture starts with the awareness of your body position and stance. One of the most positive steps you can take is to develop core strength that stabilizes posture from the front and the back. This will help keep shoulders, hips and knees in alignment, encouraging strength to be developed in a more balanced manner. BREATHING Breathing function is an essential part of athletic performance. Posture plays an important part in good breathing function. Bad posture encumbers breathing capacity by allowing the trunk of the body to be compressed, leaving less room for the lungs to expand and contract. One of the quickest and best ways to improve your breathing during exercise is to stand up straight. Breathing rhythm is very important. Just as we use rhythmic breathing in the pool, it should also be used during strength training. Avoid holding the breath during exertion. Instead, just like swimming, and most all other sports, exhale during exertion and inhale during recovery. Exchanging air properly will keep your muscles better supplied with the oxygen they need to perform. It will also keep you from fatiguing as quickly. CONTROL It is important to control every movement against resistance, both in the power phase and recovery. Always maintain balance and stability during the power phase. Always return to the starting position gently and with less speed. Never allow an

has a much neater swimming technique: most of the movement comes from her hips, not her knees, and she is kicking mostly underwater with only her heels breaking the surface. --- Page 10 Text --- SWIMMING IS SIMPLE swim verb float, glide, slip, stroke, submerge, move or propel yourself through water using natural means such as arms and legs At heart, swimming is simple. The basic techniques – arm pull and recovery, kick, and body movement – aren’t especially complicated. But unless you’ve been a competitive swimmer, you probably don’t really have a clear idea of what you should be trying to achieve. This chapter gives you that information. WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR Aim for a smooth stroke, your body rolling from side to side with each arm stroke, but always straight and level in the water. Breathing should be a seamless --- OCR from Page 10 Image 1 --- ea . * gent ye 2 nee --- Page 11 Text --- part of the side-to-side roll that comes with each arm stroke. Your legs kick in a rhythm that matches your arms. FRONT CRAWL ARM PULL Each front crawl arm pull should be a smooth arm movement. However, when thinking about your technique it’s useful to divide each arm stroke into four stages: 1. Entry 2. Catch 3. Pull 4. Recovery The underwater part of each stroke begins slow and gets faster. Your hand accelerates, moving faster as you reach the end of the pull. Stage 1: Entry Your arm enters the water fingertips first, with the thumb side angled slightly downward. It goes in level with your shoulder (rather than your nose). Your hand then stretches forward, still off centre, and turns so that it’s flat to the bottom of the pool. Stage 2: Catch Your arm begins

arm enters the water fingertips first, with the thumb side angled slightly downward. It goes in level with your shoulder (rather than your nose). Your hand then stretches forward, still off centre, and turns so that it’s flat to the bottom of the pool. Stage 2: Catch Your arm begins to bend and your hand sweeps downward, with your elbow bent and staying high. At this point your body has rolled, so that the pulling side is slightly down and the other side slightly up. This stage of your stroke feels like a powered glide, maintaining your speed but not increasing it. Stage 3: Pull The pull is the stage that adds speed. Most swimmers pull in a slightly curved path. Their hand sweeps in from the line of their shoulder to just inside the outer line of their body, then out again to leave the water with their thumb brushing their hip or thigh. Other swimmers find that a feeling of pulling straight back works best (though the roll of their body means they don’t actually pull straight backward). --- Page 12 Text --- Stage 4: Recovery Your elbow leaves the water before your hand, and leads the recovery. Leading with your hand rather than your elbow is a common mistake. It often causes the body to twist and kink, rather than keeping in a straight line. It’s important to relax your arm during the recovery, as this helps you swim smoothly. BREATHING --- Page 13 Text --- Breathing is one of the things lots of untrained swimmers have trouble with. Often it’s because they’re turning their head to breathe by twisting their neck around, lifting their chin, or both. This makes your stroke lumpy and uneven, and tends to lead to snaking along the pool when you should

have to use two stacked up. • Swimming snorkel, which rises in front of your face and is handy in some drills and for practising kick. If you use one of these, you’ll also need a nose clip. --- Page 17 Text --- • Ankle band: this is a rubber band that goes around your ankles, making sure you don’t cheat when you’re supposed to be swimming arms-only. You can make these out of old bike inner tubes. • A rubber hat if you have long hair (which otherwise will drag and affect your head position). If you’re taking part in a triathlon, a specialist tri-suit, which can be worn during all three legs – swim, bike and run – is useful. In cold water, triathletes swim wearing a wetsuit, which makes you more streamlined and buoyant. Keys to success • Count your strokes on every length to get an idea of how your stroke is working. As your stroke becomes more efficient, your should find you are taking fewer strokes per length when swimming at the same pool. • Swim with a smooth arm and leg action, moving continuously; avoid jerky, splashy actions • Keep your body straight. Side-to-side roll is good, but twisting and kinking is bad --- Page 19 Text --- FLEXIBILITY flexible adj. lissom, supple, lithe, elastic, able to bend or be bent repeatedly without damage or injury This chapter comes before the technique sections for a reason. Put simply, if you lack flexibility, there are some elements of swimming technique you’ll never be able to manage. People with stiff neck, shoulders and back find it particularly hard to master technique, but overall flexibility is important in swimming.

some elements of swimming technique you’ll never be able to manage. People with stiff neck, shoulders and back find it particularly hard to master technique, but overall flexibility is important in swimming. STRETCHING TECHNIQUES Never do any stretch to a point where it hurts. You need to be able to feel a bit of --- Page 20 Text --- pull in the muscles you’re stretching, but if it starts to hurt, gently ease out of the stretch and try again. It’s best to time your movement into the stretch to happen as you breathe out. If you need to take a breath, stop moving while you breathe in. Use your breath When you’ve taken a stretch as far as is comfortable, concentrate on breathing deeply, from your stomach rather than your chest. It helps you relax and get a little more from the stretch. INCREASING FLEXIBILITY To improve their swimming, most people also need to improve their general flexibility. A great way to do this is to take a yoga course. There are lots of different schools of yoga: a gentle one may be best. Scaravelli yoga seems to be useful for swimming, but it’s not that common, and it can be hard to find courses. Hatha yoga is a good alternative. The exercises on the following pages are mainly targeted at swimming (apart from the sun salute for general flexibility). You can do them just about anywhere: sitting in front of the TV, on the poolside, out in the garden. Try to do some flexibility work every day – 15 minutes spent on this pays dividends in the pool. WARMING UP AND WARMING DOWN As well as using stretches to improve your flexibility, make them part of every swimming session. Spend 10 minutes at the start and finish of

garden. Try to do some flexibility work every day – 15 minutes spent on this pays dividends in the pool. WARMING UP AND WARMING DOWN As well as using stretches to improve your flexibility, make them part of every swimming session. Spend 10 minutes at the start and finish of every session doing some stretching. At the start, it prepares your muscles for what’s coming; at the finish, it will reduce any muscle soreness and fatigue you feel the next day. Dynamic stretches are best for warming up, static ones for warming down. GENERAL FLEXIBILITY --- Page 21 Text --- As a simple, time-effective way of improving your general flexibility, it’s hard to beat a bit of yoga. In particular, try following the lead of millions of people and starting each day with a sun salute or two. It’s helpful to have a yoga mat for this, but I do it most mornings on an old carpet and have yet to suffer any ill effects. Sun salute There are slightly differing versions of the sun salute: what’s shown here seems to work well for swimming and cycling. 1. Stand in balance, heels on the floor, feet shoulder-width apart. Be careful not to stick your bottom out. Reach your arms above your head and extend them, but without altering your body position. 2. Bend forward from the waist, keeping your arms stretched out and your feet flat. Touch the ground with your hands, or get as close as you can to that. Relax your jaw, neck, back and stomach so that you’re dangling from the waist. Breathe deeply. Steps 1 and 2 alone are an excellent stretch to do as a way of relaxing your jaw, neck and back muscles. --- Page 22 Text --- 3. Place your hands on the

Steps 1 and 2 alone are an excellent stretch to do as a way of relaxing your jaw, neck and back muscles. --- Page 22 Text --- 3. Place your hands on the floor. Bend one leg, and place the other one straight back behind you. Drop your hips (make sure not to twist them sideways), and feel the stretch in your groin. 4. Bring the bent leg back beside the extended one, so that you end up in a dead- straight press-up position. Hold this – it can be a bit of a trembler – for two or three breaths. Hold each pose Spend a little time in each pose. Holding each one for about five deep, long --- Page 23 Text --- breaths is usually about right. 5. Drop your knees to the floor and, keeping your arms stretched out in front of you, scrunch up like someone praying. 6. Pivot forward and drop your hips to the floor, arching your lower back while extending through the shoulders and neck and pushing up with straight arms. --- Page 24 Text --- Imagine your head is lifting upward, and avoid arcing your neck back. 7. Push up on to all fours, with straight back legs and bent at the waist. You’re aiming to make an upside-down V shape. Keep your legs and arms as straight as possible, and if you can manage it have your feet flat on the floor (this isn’t crucial). Relax, especially your shoulders, neck and jaw. It should feel as if your head is dangling loosely between your shoulders. --- Page 25 Text --- 8. Step forward with the same leg as stepped back in step 3 of

It should feel as if your head is dangling loosely between your shoulders. --- Page 25 Text --- 8. Step forward with the same leg as stepped back in step 3 of the sun salute. You should find yourself in a mirror image of the position from step 3. 9. Return to the position shown in step 2 of the sun salute. 10. Either finish as in step 1, but in reverse: standing back up with straight arms out in front and your weight on the balls of your feet. Or, ending with your arms hanging down at your sides. In this, try to imagine each individual vertebra straightening, starting from the very bottom of your spine. Let your arms dangle loosely, and keep your neck and jaw relaxed. --- Page 29 Text --- HIPS AND TORSO Tightness in this area, in the middle of your body, affects your ability to roll from side to side while maintaining a steady, smooth kicking action. It can also make it harder to stretch forward as your hand enters the water. These stretches improve flexibility in the hips, groin and related muscles. Hip stretch 1 Sit down with your legs out straight in front of you. Bent and lift your right leg, placing your foot on the outside of your left knee. Turn to the right, keeping your hips level and your bottom flat on the ground. Place your left forearm outside your right knee then gently move your right knee outward. Hold for five deep breaths, then repeat on the other side. Hip stretch 1. Hip stretch 2 From a standing position, take a lunge step forward. Kneel on your rear knee: this knee

Hip stretch 2 From a standing position, take a lunge step forward. Kneel on your rear knee: this knee needs to be behind your hip. Cup your hands over your front knee, then move your hips forward until you feel the stretch in your hip and upper thigh. Your front knee should be at an angle of at least 90°. Hold the stretch for several deep, long breaths, then repeat with the other leg. --- Page 30 Text --- Hip stretch 2. Side stretch This simple stretch is great is you’re having trouble extending forward after your hand enters the water. Concentrate on breathing deeply and relaxing into the stretch. Stand in the starting position for the sun salute. Make sure your hips are tucked in and relaxed, and your feet shoulder-width apart (this is closer together than most people think – use a mirror or the reflection in a window to check, if you can). Bring your arms above your head, and hold your left wrist with your right hand. Lean to the right: take care to keep your body facing forward, don’t let yourself turn your shoulders or hips in the direction of the stretch. When you feel a stretch down your side, hold the position for several deep breaths, then return to the starting point. Repeat for the other side. --- Page 32 Text --- SHOULDERS AND NECK These two stretches help with your shoulder mobility, which is crucial for swimming front crawl.

for the other side. --- Page 32 Text --- SHOULDERS AND NECK These two stretches help with your shoulder mobility, which is crucial for swimming front crawl. Doing them regularly makes stretching forward after your arm has entered the water much easier. This starts your body rolling and puts it in the correct position for the rest of the arm pull. Don’t worry if you find these stretches easier on one side than the other – almost everyone has the same experience. Crossed-forearms stretch 1. Stand or sit upright looking straight ahead, with your shoulders relaxed. Take a deep breath, and as you let it out, bring your arms up and forward, and cross them at the elbows. 2. Bring the forearm of the lower arm inward, and cup your fingertips in the heel of the other hand. Take another deep breath and relax your jaw and shoulders, letting the shoulders drop. Try to keep them in this position throughout. 3. Slowly lift your elbows up and forward (don’t forget to keep your shoulders relaxed). As your elbows rise, you should feel the stretch engage different muscles between your shoulder blades. Move your elbows up and down slowly several times, holding them in position and taking a couple of deep breaths if you feel an area of tightness. --- Page 33 Text --- 4. Release, and repeat with the opposite elbow highest. Reaching-behind stretch 1. Again, stand or sit up straight. Relax your jaw and shoulders, and let your shoulders drop. Lift one arm up and out to the side with a bent elbow, reach around behind your head, and tuck your elbow around the back of your head. Aim for your forearm to be dangling down the line of your spine. 2. Bring your other arm behind your back,

drop. Lift one arm up and out to the side with a bent elbow, reach around behind your head, and tuck your elbow around the back of your head. Aim for your forearm to be dangling down the line of your spine. 2. Bring your other arm behind your back, letting the back of your hand rest at the base of your spine. Bend your elbow, and work your hand up the line of your spine. You’re aiming for the back of your hand to be resting between your shoulder blades. 3. Try to place the palms of your hands together. Don’t overstrain this stretch: as ever, this is likely to cause injury. Very few people can manage this stretch first go (even second, or twenty-second go). You may only be able to get your fingertips to touch, or not be able to touch your hands at all. Don’t worry, this is a good thing – it means you have an obvious area where your swimming stroke can be improved. --- Page 34 Text --- Never clench! Some people learn a version of this stretch in which they link their fingers together, like one Action Man stopping another from plunging into a chasm. This can lead to overstretching or injury; it’s best just to let your hands touch. LEGS It’s not immediately apparent, but relaxed, flexible legs are important when swimming freestyle. Your kicking action should be light and loose, coming from the hips: anything else is likely to upset your stroke. You’ll only achieve this ‘flutter kick’ if your legs and ankles are flexible. Leg stretch 1 Stand well away from a wall, with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lean forward and rest your palms against the wall, stepping one leg forward too. The other leg stays straight, with your

your stroke. You’ll only achieve this ‘flutter kick’ if your legs and ankles are flexible. Leg stretch 1 Stand well away from a wall, with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lean forward and rest your palms against the wall, stepping one leg forward too. The other leg stays straight, with your foot flat on the floor and pointing forward. Bend your elbows and feel the stretch in the back of your leg. After several deep, slow breaths, return to the starting position and repeat the exercise with the other leg stretched out behind. Finally, place both feet together and repeat once more. --- Page 35 Text --- Leg stretch 1. Leg stretch 2 This one is good for your hamstrings if you’ve ridden a bike to the pool. Sit up straight, with your legs out in front of you and your toes pointing up in the air. Move one foot back, sliding the sole along the calf and thigh of your other leg. Staying upright, reach forward with both hands and place your fingertips on the toes of the foot pointing up in the air. Hold the stretch for five deep breaths or so, return to the starting position, and repeat for the other leg. --- Page 36 Text --- Leg stretch 2. Leg stretch 3 Stand upright, next to a wall if your balance isn’t great. Lift one foot behind you, hold it with your hand, and press your heel into your bottom. Here you might need to grab something for balance. Hold the stretch while you breathe deeply several times, release your foot and let it swing gently forward. Repeat using the other leg. Take care with this stretch not to arch your lower back when you pull your foot in: your hips should stay level with the ground.

WARMING UP Stretching has a part to play in warming up before a training session (whether it’s a technique session or a fitness one). Lots of English people feel embarrassed about stretching on the side of the pool – it’s seen as a bit effete or unnecessary. But warming up properly prepares your body for exercise, making injury much less likely. Warming up – legs If you can, one of the best ways of getting your body systems going before a swimming session is to cycle to the pool. A distance of about 10km will wake your muscles up to the fact that they’re exercising, prepare the joints in your hips, knees and ankles, and lift your heart rate. Don’t race: just go at a speed that would make holding a conversation moderately tricky. Once you get to the pool, you’ll need to stretch your hamstrings a bit, because cycling only offers them a limited range of movement. Leg stretch 2 is good for this. --- Page 38 Text --- Most people have one area of their body that needs a little extra flexibility work. If you’re a keen cyclist it may be your hamstrings. If you sit at a desk all day, that can result in tight hip flexor muscles. If you do have an area of particular inflexibility, it’s worth getting expert advice about how to address it, because the problem doesn’t always originate from the place where you can

be your hamstrings. If you sit at a desk all day, that can result in tight hip flexor muscles. If you do have an area of particular inflexibility, it’s worth getting expert advice about how to address it, because the problem doesn’t always originate from the place where you can feel the stiffness. Warming up – shoulders and upper body Your shoulders will need a bit more work, because they haven’t been doing much on the bike. Start with the shoulders and neck stretches, and the forward bend (this does have a slightly 1930s-Swedish-exercise feel to it, but is very effective nonetheless). Warm up your shoulders further with some active movement. Do this one arm at a time. Windmill your arm backward, a bit like doing backstroke. Start slowly, trying to relax your shoulder so that there’s no creaking, clicking or straining. Steadily build up the speed of the windmills until you feel a slight tingling in your fingertips. Maintain the movement for 10 full windmills, and stop. Breathe out and relax your shoulders, then repeat with the other arm. Next do the whole thing again, but this time with each arm windmilling forward, a bit like doing freestyle. --- Page 39 Text --- Static stretches like this are often used for warming down, but some swimmers also include them in their warm-up. --- Page 40 Text --- Dynamic stretching like this arm windmilling is ideal for warming up before you get in the pool. Remember, your movements shouldn’t be too sudden or severe. WARMING DOWN Including a proper warm-down in your swimming routine has several benefits.

too sudden or severe. WARMING DOWN Including a proper warm-down in your swimming routine has several benefits. The key one is that a warm-down containing some stretching will prevent or ease the muscle soreness you feel later. --- Page 41 Text --- For swimmers, a warm-down in two parts is a good idea: 1. Swim a reasonable distance (for most people, between 100m and 400m is about right) at a steady pace. Don’t crawl along so slowly you’re practically sinking, just don’t push things. Concentrate on keeping your stroke long and balanced, trying to glide through the water. 2. Do a few key stretches. My favourites are the shoulder stretches, the forward bend, and the leg stretch. You’ll find the ones that work for you: the areas where you tend to feel muscle soreness will guide you, but don’t forget that this will change as your stroke develops. --- Page 42 Text --- EATING Try to eat something – a banana, a sandwich or a flapjack, something that has a carbohydrate element – within 15 minutes or so of finishing a training session. This is a window of time in which your body efficiently replaces the muscle energy that is burned during demanding exercise. In general, swimming doesn’t require a special diet. Just try to eat a balance of different foods, and avoid too many fatty, fried meals and alcohol. If you’re swimming partly with the aim of losing weight, bear in mind that the only way to do this is to burn more calories than you eat, which will cause feelings of --- Page 43 Text --- hunger. Keys to success • It’s OK to concentrate a bit more on specific areas, but make sure your flexibility training encompasses your whole body • Try to work flexibility exercises into

slightly ahead but with your neck basically in line with your body. You can experiment with head position while swimming along: too low will immediately be obvious, you’ll be able to feel it slowing you down. Too high and it will drag your hips down, and you’ll feel like a lifeguard crashing out through the surf. The correct angle is a happy medium of possible head positions. Much higher or lower and it will cause drag. The top photo shows a swimmer with his head too high, which will cause his hips to sink. In the middle image his head has drifted too low: even his shoulder is catching water and creating drag. In the final image, the swimmer’s head position is ideal. Top tip Try to make sure your head stays as still as possible while you swim. One tip that will help you do this is: KEEP THE TOP OF YOUR HEAD IN ONE --- Page 46 Text --- SPOT As you swim along, look down at the bottom of the pool. Imagine that the top of your head has a dot on top of it, pointing straight at the end of the lane. To someone watching, the dot shouldn’t move much, or at all. Even as your head turns for a breath, the dot stays steady.

roughly the same level in the water, just below the surface. Most people naturally hold their body a little bit bent forward, so to be dead flat you have to slightly extend your chest, stomach and hips, as in the streamlined position drill. Hip dragger or bottom waggler? Swimmers with their chest and hips in an inefficient, draggy position are a common sight in pools around the world. The two key problems are dragging your hips (swimming with them lower in the water than your chest), and lifting your hips so that your bottom sticks up. It’s hard to know for yourself if you have either of these problems, so ask a friend to watch you swim and tell you. Hip draggers: Hip dragging is often caused by a poor catch, a weak or poor leg --- Page 47 Text --- kick (for advice on how to improve this, see here) or a too-high head position. It’s often also linked to a lack of flexibility in your hips: see the hip torso stretches that can help improve this. Bottom wagglers: Bottom waggling often happens when swimmers have a poor kicking technique or a too-low head position. Using the head position just mentioned may get rid of the problem. It’s also useful to work on improving extension through the chest and stomach, pushing down slightly with the buttocks and opening the hips. This should bring your head and shoulders forward and up, and your bottom down.

exercise helps you to fix muscle memory of what a streamlined body position feels like. --- Page 49 Text --- What you need • A wall at least 2.5m high, in a warm room Stand with your back against the wall. In order, place your heels, bottom, shoulder blades and the back of your head against the wall. Step forward, trying to keep this straight-line shape. Step back, and see if you’ve succeeded. At first, most people don’t – but keep trying! Next, bring your arms up straight over your head, thumbs linked together. Press the backs of your hands against the wall, without any of the other contact points losing touch. This is a streamlined position. See for yourself: Drag and head position Swim a length with your usual style, counting how many strokes it takes. Rest for a minute, then swim a second length with your chin tucked into your chest, again counting strokes. After another minute, swim a third length with your chin up at the water’s surface. You’ll soon see how an extreme head position increases drag. STREAMLINING The next two drills will help you to develop a streamlined body position, with your head, shoulders, chest and hips all in the right alignment. They seem tough at first, and it might feel like you’re going backward. The benefits will become clear when you switch to full stroke.

It doesn’t usually work on its own, but this can be a helpful tool when adapting your stroke. Body position float This drill appears ridiculously simple – until you try to do it. It takes some people weeks before they can manage it, but don’t give up: this is a really good test of whether you can get your body into a streamlined position. What you need • It’s not essential, but a swimming snorkel might help at first 1. Take a deep breath, and let yourself float face down in the water. Your whole body should be relaxed. You’ll soon work out why some coaches call this the ‘dead swimmer float’: it might be a good idea to warn the lifeguards what you’re up to. 2. Lift and reach your arms into the streamlined position. 3. Point your toes, and steadily bring your legs up to the surface. You’re aiming to get four points of your body at the surface: • back of your head • back of your shoulders • bottom • heels Don’t force any of the movements toward the final position by kicking or using your hands: just let your body float up. Keep your neck relaxed, and look down at the bottom of the pool, rather than ahead or behind. --- Page 51 Text --- Streamlining This is another very simple drill; to get benefit from it, you need to listen hard to your own body.

drill; to get benefit from it, you need to listen hard to your own body. This always applies in swimming, of course – try to feel how the water presses against your skin, where there’s more resistance and where least. Water resistance is your enemy: any way you can find to avoid it will improve your swimming. What you need • Swim fins • A swimming snorkel 1. Put on your fins, and push off into the streamlined position. Lay one hand on top of the other, and look at the bottom of the pool rather than looking ahead. Many swimmers find that the most streamlined head position looks down more than they expected. 2. Kick with a steady rhythm, fast enough to feel the water resistance as you move ahead. Make sure you’re always kicking water, with no more than your heels breaking the surface. 3. Experiment with different head, shoulder, hip and foot positions to see how they affect water resistance. Try pressing down with your chest, extending through the stomach, tightening up your back and bottom – but always come back to the streamlined position (and float position). --- Page 52 Text --- Top tip COUNT YOUR STROKES Counting your strokes is a good guide to how efficient your technique is becoming. As your swimming gets smoother and more streamlined, it will take fewer strokes for you to complete a length at a given speed. (Usually your stroke count rises slightly as you swim faster.) This is a rough guide to what stroke counts by an adult swimmer in a 25m pool might indicate: 25+ strokes per length: Taking this many strokes would generally mean there’s plenty of room for improvement in your technique and streamlining. 20–24 strokes per length: Although at the lower end of this

but your torso spins around the imaginary straight line running from your head to your feet. There are three big advantages to rolling your body with each stroke. First, you’re more streamlined and slip through the water using less energy. Second, the roll helps your leading hand extend further forward at the front of your stroke, adding to your pull. Third, it makes a smooth breathing action easier to achieve. Swimmer rolled to the side, breathing. Swimmer rolled to the same side, not breathing. Notice how the amount of body roll is similar in both photos See for yourself: Body roll and reach It’s easy to show how rolling your body extends the reach of your stroke: • Stand square to a table, about a metre away, and bend forward so that your --- Page 54 Text --- torso’s parallel to the ground • Reach toward the table with one arm, as you would at the front of your freestyle stroke, but keeping your shoulders square • Now turn your shoulders, so that the one reaching out drops and the other one rises See how much dropping your shoulder adds to your reach? These drills will help you develop good body roll as part of your stroke. In the second drill, the body roll is linked to taking a breath. This helps develop good, smooth breathing technique. Don’t forget, though – you roll with every stroke, not only the ones when you take a breath. Body roll drill 1 This drill allows you to get a feel for swimming in a streamlined position on your side.

Your head will turn to the side – just let it turn with your body, don’t twist your neck – and your right shoulder, arm and hip will lift out of the water, so you’re swimming along on your side. 3. Swim like this for a steady count of four, turn your head to take a breath, and carry on. Swim a whole length like this, with your right side up; repeat with your left side up on the next length. --- Page 56 Text --- Body roll drill 2 This is a development of drill 1, but it adds a change of sides. Don’t worry overmuch if your breathing needs work (just turn to Chapter 5 for advice) – in this drill, the focus is on getting used to swimming in a streamlined position on both sides. What you need • Pool with a straight line along the bottom • Swim fins 1. Push off along the line and take one stroke with your right arm, as in the previous drill. 2. Kick your legs 10 times, then take a stroke with your left arm while recovering your right arm. As you do this, your body rolls to the other side and you can take a breath. 3.

stroke. The advice in this section will help solve the problem, but if your stroke only twists one way, it would also be a good idea to start breathing bilaterally. See for yourself: twist It’s easy to demonstrate to yourself how twist affects your stroke: • Push off the side of the pool keeping your body as straight as you can, and see how far you glide • Push off again, but with your head and feet twisting as far to the same side as possible You’ll soon get the measure of how badly twist can slow you down --- Page 59 Text --- This swimmer’s stroke has twist on both sides of her body. Twist to both sides Twist to both sides has two common causes: trying too hard, and lack of flexibility. Swimmers trying to swim as fast as possible often throw their arms violently forward. This pulls their shoulders round, and causes their hips and legs to crab around in the same direction. Lack of shoulder flexibility can also cause (or make worse) the twist in your stroke. Rather than extending the shoulders to reach forward and begin the arm pull, swimmers lacking shoulder flexibility have to twist their body. Because of this, the advice on the next pages should always be combined with flexibility exercises. --- Page 60 Text --- ELIMINATING TWIST As part of your effort to eliminate twist from your stroke, try to imagine your spine is part of an inflexible steel rod running down your body from head to toe.

If you don’t like this image (and I don’t blame you), try imagining you’re swimming with your body inside a tube and it mustn’t touch the sides. Twist experiment What you need • Swimming pool with lines along the bottom • Swim fins • Mono snorkel Find yourself a lane position that allows you to swim along above a line on the bottom of the pool. Use the line as a guide, which your head is travelling along. Concentrate on keeping your head smack in the middle of the line. As you start each arm pull, examine how your body is affected by where you place each hand into the water. Reaching across the centre line of your body causes twist. Reaching out to the side, away from the line of your shoulders, also causes twist. You should find that the ideal entry point is somewhere more or less in line with your shoulder. --- Page 61 Text --- Keys to success • Learn a flat, streamlined position, with the back of your head, shoulders, bottom and heels all just breaking the surface • Remember: roll is good, twist is bad • Imagine you’re swimming with your body inside a tube, and you mustn’t touch the sides • Aim to breathe bilaterally (on both sides), if you don’t already --- Page 62 Text --- ARM STROKE stroke verb soothe, smooth, caress noun in swimming, a single complete movement of the arms and/or legs A lot of swimmers barely think about their arm stroke.

Others look into the subject and quickly find themselves confused by the variety of advice on offer: should your hand pull in an S-shape, under your body or not, what kind of recovery should you use, and so on. In this section, you’ll learn a style of arm stroke that strikes a good balance between power and streamlining. --- Page 63 Text --- WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR We have already described the WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR of a good freestyle pulling action. Overall, the key elements of the freestyle arm stroke are: • Hand entry into the water • The path your hand takes through the water, which can be divided into three phases: catch, in-sweep and out-sweep • Hand shape while pulling • Exit from the water and recovery REDUCE DRAG, SWIM BETTER In swimming, drag is your number one enemy. Reducing drag trumps anything else you can do to improve your technique. In your arm stroke, you can reduce drag by using a high-elbow pull. Using this, your hand enters the water in front of your shoulder. Then the path traced through the water by your hand stays outside the edge of your body for much of its time underwater. --- Page 64 Text --- Many swimmers use a different pull, in which they put their hand into the water right on the centre line of their body, and pull in a shape that curves in under their torso. This is more powerful than the high-elbow pull, but it creates a lot of drag. The high-elbow pull is more streamlined, smoother, uses less energy, and makes it easier to swim at a sustained speed. This makes it especially useful

pull in a shape that curves in under their torso. This is more powerful than the high-elbow pull, but it creates a lot of drag. The high-elbow pull is more streamlined, smoother, uses less energy, and makes it easier to swim at a sustained speed. This makes it especially useful for distance swims, open water and triathlon. Side-on view of swimmer with high-elbow action; this is also called ‘early vertical forearm’ technique, because the elbow is close to the surface and the forearm is pointing straight down HAND ENTRY Each freestyle arm stroke begins when your hand enters the water. For a high- elbow stroke, your hand needs to go in roughly in line with your shoulder. Try to slide your hand below the surface without making a big splash, by angling it slightly thumb-down. There’s no need to worry too much about this, but a big, splashy hand entry means you’re wasting energy by hitting against the water. Once your hand has slid into the water, your shoulder extends and moves down, starting your body’s roll to the side and allowing you to reach further ahead. At this point your hand should still be in line with your shoulder, and the back of your hand should be just below the surface. --- Page 65 Text --- Angled hand entry Extended arm with flat hand --- Page 66 Text --- This swimmer is using a single-arm drill to work on his pulling action. UNDERWATER ACTION Your underwater action should be one smooth movement, with your hand accelerating toward the end of the pull. It’s useful, though, to separate the underwater action into three phases: • Catch, in which your arm moves into a position in which it can start to add significant propulsion. • In-sweep, in which your elbow is

in again. --- Page 72 Text --- THE CATCH: HIGH-ELBOW INITIATION --- Page 73 Text --- Once you’ve done them a few times, the straight-arms and bent-arms scull drills will give you a good feel for swimming with your arms further away from your body than most people are used to. The next two drills will help you introduce the high-elbow technique into the catch phase of your stroke. Lane line initiation In this drill, your elbow is kept high because it’s hooked over a lane rope. This gives you a feel for initiating the catch phase with a high-elbow position. What you need • A tight, supportive lane rope 1. Holding on to the lane rope, place yourself at an angle of 90° to it. Float with your body at the surface in a streamlined position, kicking gently toward the rope to keep your hips and legs up. Have your arms extended in front of you. 2. Move forward so that one arm is over the rope, with the rope resting just behind the elbow. You need to be as close as possible to the position you’d take when starting an arm stroke. 3. With your head down as it would be when you’re swimming, pull down and back with the arm that’s hooked over the rope. --- Page 74 Text --- High-elbow scull Try this drill next, and focus on keeping your elbows high. 1. Push off in a streamlined position, as you would to swim freestyle. Allow your hands to drift shoulder-width apart, so that each is in the starting position for a stroke. 2. Keeping your elbows high, use a circular sculling motion with your hand and forearm. Each hand moves slightly out, back in and toward your chest, and then forward to return to its

your hands to drift shoulder-width apart, so that each is in the starting position for a stroke. 2. Keeping your elbows high, use a circular sculling motion with your hand and forearm. Each hand moves slightly out, back in and toward your chest, and then forward to return to its starting point. 3. Experiment with hand angles to maximise propulsion and minimise drag where needed. --- Page 75 Text --- THE IN-SWEEP The in-sweep is the phase of your stroke that follows the catch. During the in- sweep your hand sweeps back and in, toward your hips. This is where you start to generate real propulsion. --- Page 76 Text --- THE OUT-SWEEP The out-sweep happens roughly halfway through your arm pull. Your hand and forearm begin to move outward, heading for the outer edge of your hip. At this point your hand is accelerating, getting faster as your elbow lifts in preparation for the hand leaving the water and the recovery phase starting. Fixing position using edge of pool This exercise helps you build a mental picture and muscle memory of the position of your arms at the start of the in-sweep phase. What you need • A pool with a raised deck (ideally with the deck about 30 cm above the surface) 1. Hold on to the side of the deck with your hands, and allow your body to sink down parallel with the wall of the pool. 2. Place your forearms flat on the deck, shoulder width apart or slightly wider and at 90° to the edge of the pool. 3. Let your body sink right down so that your weight is on your forearms and your shoulders are extended. Look straight ahead, with your head at the same angle as it would be while swimming. ---

Look straight ahead, with your head at the same angle as it would be while swimming. --- Page 77 Text --- HAND SHAPE One common question from untrained swimmers is what shape they should make with their hands. Many people have been taught to swim with their hands tightly cupped, in the shape you’d use if you were trying to carry a handful of rice. In fact, you need to relax your hands and let your fingers drift slightly apart, while keeping them in a natural, curved-forward position. This sets up turbulence between your fingers and improves your hold on the water. Correct, loose hand --- Page 78 Text --- Hand too tightly cupped Fingers too far apart See for yourself To find out for yourself the best hand shape for getting a good hold on the water, go back to the sculling drill. Try it with your fingers closed, loosely spaced, then deliberately held very wide apart. It soon becomes clear that the --- Page 79 Text --- loosely spaced option generates most propulsion. Hold on the water Some swimmers naturally have a very good ‘feel’ for the water: they find it easy to get hold of, to feel the pressure of the water against their palm. Most aren’t so lucky – but fortunately, feel is something you can work on. 1. Swim freestyle exactly as normal, but with your hands closed into fists. Vary how you do this: one hand as a fist, both, three strokes with closed fists, two open, etc. 2. Notice the difference in sensation between a closed fist pushing (pretty ineffectively)

The root cause is usually problems elsewhere in their stroke: if you get your body position, arm stroke and leg kick right, breathing fits naturally into the rhythm of your swimming. Even so, it’s important to stay aware not only of how you breathe, but also why. WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR --- Page 90 Text --- The key to breathing technique in freestyle is that it should be part of the general movement of your stroke. Unless you manage this, every time you take a breath it throws your whole technique out of balance, which causes drag and slows you down. • Aim for a smooth turn of the head; really no more than a slight addition to the roll of your body as you take a stroke. • Keep your neck at the same angle as usual: you’re aiming to turn your head to the side slightly, not to lift it from the water.

comes out of the water at all, your head may be too low, and you need to look a little more ahead. --- Page 95 Text --- Kick–breathe drill This is a really simple drill, which helps you get used to the small movement you should be making to take a breath. What you need • Swim fins 1. Push off and begin to kick in a streamlined position, with both arms in front of you. Take one arm stroke, but without the recovery. Instead, leave your hand straight back, next to your hip. 2. Reach forward with your leading arm, dropping the shoulder and rolling to add length. As you do this, the shoulder of your trailing arm will lift up, leaving you swimming on your side. Your head will be mostly underwater, and your neck in line with your spine. 3. To breathe, simply turn your head sideways, then lower it again. Make sure you rotate your head – don’t lift it. 4. Give a few more kicks, and repeat the breath. Do a whole length breathing on this same side, then change sides for the following length. Rolling breath drill This drill’s key aim is to establish the timing of when to take a breath. You --- Page 96 Text --- also develop a sensation of what it’s like to breathe on both sides of your body (if you don’t already do so). Finally, the drill helps you to swim with a balanced stroke, returning to a streamlined position after each breath. What you need • Swim fins 1. Put on fins. Push off into a streamlined position, and take an arm stroke without the recovery, as in the previous drill. Reach forward and let your body turn into the breathing position described in step 2 of

streamlined position after each breath. What you need • Swim fins 1. Put on fins. Push off into a streamlined position, and take an arm stroke without the recovery, as in the previous drill. Reach forward and let your body turn into the breathing position described in step 2 of the previous drill. 2. Take a breath, and keep swimming on your side for a count of three. You’ll find that a fast leg kick makes this drill easier to complete. 3. At the count of three, take an arm pull with your extended arm and recover with your trailing arm. Coordinate the two movements. As you roll to the other side during the arm stroke, leave the pulling arm trailing and the recovery arm extended, so that you’re in the breathing position again, but facing the other side. 4. Take a breath, swim on your side for a count of three, and continue down the length of the pool in the same way. Try to keep your movements smooth – it’s tempting to snatch at the arm pull. You’ll find that a strong leg kick helps, as it allows you to concentrate on the motion of your upper body. Extra focus points Some swimmers find the rolling breath drill tricky at first. It’s worth persevering, because this drill is a great way to build up a nice, even side-to- side roll in your stroke. Once you have mastered the basic drill, bring in extra focus points: 1. Make sure that while you’re swimming on your side your ear is cushioned on your shoulder. This should bring your vision perpendicular to the line of the water’s surface. 2. When you take a pull and change sides, keep your vision (and head) at this --- Page 97 Text --- angle. So,

that while you’re swimming on your side your ear is cushioned on your shoulder. This should bring your vision perpendicular to the line of the water’s surface. 2. When you take a pull and change sides, keep your vision (and head) at this --- Page 97 Text --- angle. So, your line of vision should traverse smoothly from an on-its-side view of the edge of the pool, through looking straight down at the bottom of the pool, to an on-its-side view of the opposite wall. Two-pull drill This drill adds a new element to the previous one. Now you’ll be combining a breathing stroke with a non-breathing stroke. Initially, you swim breathing every two strokes, alternating sides after each length. The progression version introduces breathing on both sides during the same length. --- Page 98 Text --- What you need --- Page 99 Text --- • Swim fins 1. Put on your fins, and push off into a streamlined position. Use a powerful leg kick: this drill works best if you’re getting consistent drive from your legs. 2. Take a stroke with your left arm, but without the recovery. Leave your left arm trailing at your hip, and reach forward with your right arm. Your left shoulder will lift so that you’re swimming partially on your side. 3. Swim like this for a couple of beats, until you feel settled in that position, then take a stroke with your right arm and recover your left arm. Notice the timing of when your recovery begins versus when your arm pull begins. As you do this, roll to the right, so that now your right shoulder is up and you’re looking to the right side. 4. Smoothly turn your head to take a long, smooth breath, then let it sink back into

when your recovery begins versus when your arm pull begins. As you do this, roll to the right, so that now your right shoulder is up and you’re looking to the right side. 4. Smoothly turn your head to take a long, smooth breath, then let it sink back into the water. Again, keep the position until you settle, then take an arm stroke with your left arm, returning to the position in 2. Don’t take a breath: just settle, and repeat the sequence all the way down the length. Progression version This drill is done with more pace. You still need a strong leg kick, but the stroke rate (the speed at which your arms move) is also higher. 1. Push off into a streamlined position, using a strong leg kick. Take an arm stroke without the recovery, rolling your body to the side but not taking a breath. Hold this position for a count of 2. 2. Take an arm pull with your leading arm and recover your trailing arm, rolling your body so that you’re facing the other side. Don’t forget to blow out a steady trail of air underwater.

Lie on your back, with your hands tucked under your bottom, lifting your hips slightly. 2. Raise your legs straight off the ground by about 20 cm, and flutter your feet, flicking your ankles as fast as you can. Do this without consciously bending your knees: try to make the movement come from the hips and thighs. 3. Keep this up – with your feet fluttering as fast as you can possibly manage – for 30 seconds. This is when having someone else there for encouragement helps! 4. Lower your legs and have a rest for one minute. Repeat at least once. As you get better at this drill, build up the time from 30 seconds to a minute and increase the number of repetitions you do. --- Page 117 Text --- Top tip FLEX YOUR ANKLES Ankle flexibility is a crucial part of the flutter kick. Improve yours by sitting with your ankle over your knee, gripping your heel and toes, and winding your foot in circles first one way, then the other, for a minute in each direction before changing feet. Kicking: building strength (part 2) This is an advanced land-based drill, which helps improve both leg strength for kicking and core body strength. It requires good balance and a certain amount of flexibility. Take this drill steady, and if your back or neck (or both) feel painful or uncomfortable, ease yourself back to a lying-down position and stop. What you need • A yoga mat or similar cushioning 1.

Lie flat on your back with your arms by your sides. Bend forward, and with a slight rocking-back motion get your hips in the air, supported on your hands. Your elbows should be below your hips, resting on the floor. Your legs will be in the air, knees bent. Your weight rests on your hips and shoulders. --- Page 118 Text --- 2. Straighten your legs so that they point up in the air. Gently lower your right leg forward and your left leg slightly backward. The two movements should balance each other out, allowing you to stay comfortably upright. 3. Bring both legs back to vertical, then perform the same movement in reverse. Take care to move slowly, to keep your hips solidly planted on your hands, and not to extend your legs too far and topple over. Repeat the movement five times on each side, alternating sides, then gently let yourself roll back to a sitting position. --- Page 119 Text --- Keys to success • Use small flutter kicks, not big splashy ones • Kick from the hips, not the knees • Kick without breaking the surface of the water with your toes • Keep your ankles loose and relaxed --- Page 120 Text --- STROKE AND RHYTHM rhythm noun pace, tempo, cadence, pulse, a regularly recurring pattern of activity, or repeated functions of the body In this last key section, the focus is on fitting everything together: combining good body position, arm stroke, breathing and leg kick into a smooth, easy, efficient style.

This is where you’re aiming to become one of those swimmers who just glides smoothly along: a stylist, rather than a splasher. --- Page 121 Text --- WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR Aim to swim freestyle with a feeling of moving continuously and smoothly forward. If your stroke feels lurching, as though there are kinks or dead spots slowing you down, try to analyse where these are coming from and go back to the relevant sections of this book. To recap the basic elements of a good freestyle swimming technique: • Keep your body straight and flat in the water • Swim with your neck in line with your spine, looking at the bottom of the pool rather than the wall • Put each hand into the water in line with your shoulder, and begin the pull with a high elbow. Avoid pulling in underneath your body • Move arm and hand through the catch, in-sweep and out-sweep phases with increasing speed • Kick your legs in a continuous flutter kick, kicking from the hips without --- Page 122 Text --- consciously bending your knees Head position, breathing At first, most swimmers find this drill something between very tricky and impossible because they’re used to swimming with their head held too high. It does come to you pretty quickly, though, and it’s a really good drill to return to again and again. It reminds you of good head position, body roll and breathing technique. What you need: • A small, not-too-squishy ball, a bit bigger than a tennis ball 1.

twist, rotate, go round, roll, twirl, move to face a different direction, move around an axis They’re not actually part of swimming technique, of course, but lots of people want to learn tumble turns, because they’re a good way of improving the distance you can cover in a set time. If you’re aiming to do a triathlon with a pool-based swimming leg, it’s also worth learning how to do faster touch turns – tumble turns aren’t allowed in some triathlons. WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR The three key elements of a tumble turn are a fast tumble or flip, timing, and a --- Page 137 Text --- strong, streamlined push off the wall. • For a fast tumble or flip, you need to initiate the turn in a snappy way, and bend your body into as compact a shape as possible • Timing your turn relies on a combination of your distance from the wall and the speed at which you’re approaching it • A strong, streamlined push off the wall allows you to travel further underwater in a streamlined position OPEN-WATER TURNS Most triathlons have an open-water swim leg, rather than a pool leg. The course is usually laid out around one or two buoys, which all the swimmers have to pass at least once to complete the distance. Most novice triathletes get badly snagged up at these see the open-water chapter, for Rounding a buoy on how to avoid that happening to you. A streamlined push off the wall The push-off: strong and streamlined 1. Hold on to the side of the pool, and bring your legs up so that your feet are against the wall about 60 cm below the surface. Have one foot above the other, with your shoulders similarly canted. 2. Let go with your hands

The push-off: strong and streamlined 1. Hold on to the side of the pool, and bring your legs up so that your feet are against the wall about 60 cm below the surface. Have one foot above the other, with your shoulders similarly canted. 2. Let go with your hands and let your body slide down under the surface. --- Page 138 Text --- Keep your body bent into a compact shape, like a coiled spring. Turn your feet and body so that you’re sideways. Make sure your feet are firmly planted against the wall. 3. Push off as hard as possible. If one or both feet skid off the wall, or one foot pushes more strongly than the other, your foot position is wrong: have another try. 4. Once you’ve found a good, planted foot position, take a few goes to fix it in your head. This is what you’ll be aiming for after learning to tumble. 5. Now add a streamlined glide, with your hands either one on top of the other or thumbs touching and your head tucked in. At the start of the glide you’ll be on your side, and by the end of it you need to have drifted round onto your front. Top tip To avoid getting a snootful of water while learning tumble turns: MAKE SURE YOU’RE FOREVER BLOWING BUBBLES --- Page 139 Text --- Keep blowing a trickle of air from your nose all the way through the tumble turn, to stop water going up your nose. Getting used to tumbling Lots of swimmers get disoriented about which way is up when they try to learn tumble turns. They quickly get a snortful of water up their nose, come up coughing and spluttering, and give up. The trick to learning a tumble

striking a balance between distance and speed. Never let yourself slow down underwater to such an extent that you’re gliding slower than you would be swimming. It’s important to get back to the surface while you’re still travelling at a good speed. Otherwise, your first few strokes will be spent wasting energy getting you back up to swimming speed. TOUCH TURNS Tumble turns are barred in some pool-based triathlons, making it a good idea for triathletes to work on fast touch turns. If you have a pool-based swim like this coming up, give up tumble turns entirely for a couple of weeks beforehand. Otherwise you’re almost certain to forget yourself in the excitement of the event, throw in an accidental tumble turn and get disqualified. Practise this technique using both left and right hand to touch the wall; that way, you won’t compromise your swimming by trying always to finish on the same hand. 1 One-handed touch You only need to touch the wall with one hand. The best way to finish is very like a tumble turn, but instead of leading the tumble with your hand you leave it extended to touch the wall. You need your hand either gripping a rail or the edge, if either is available, or flat on the wall of the pool. 2 Push back --- Page 148 Text --- Bringing your legs tightly in under your body, at the same time push away from the wall with your hand, dropping your opposite shoulder back, away from the wall. Your non-pushing hand stays under the surface. 3 Plant and drive You should now be sideways (looking left if you touched with your right hand, right if you touched with your left). As your feet plant on the wall, let the pushing hand drop through

environment can be a bit off-putting on cold, wet days. Knowing someone else is relying on you to come out helps. Having someone swimming alongside also helps you to push your level, rather than sitting back and taking it easy. Of course, you’ll also get to share the joy of lake sunrises on misty mornings, swimming into a warm beach at sunset, and so on. --- Page 153 Text --- OPEN-WATER EQUIPMENT The basics of open-water equipment are the same as for pool swimming: goggles, swimming costume, hat and earplugs. Some contests – Olympic open- water races, for example – have strict rules about the type of costume you can wear. In these, the only extra equipment you’re likely to need is petroleum jelly, to stop chafing and prevent other swimmers grabbing hold of your shoulders or feet. --- Page 154 Text --- Some competitions, such as triathlon swims in water below a certain temperature, insist on you wearing a wetsuit. You can buy these relatively inexpensively, and it’s worth doing so if you plan on swimming in open water a lot. The alternative is to rent one for the event, but this is expensive, you can’t get used to the wetsuit beforehand, and there’s no guarantee the fit will be good. PICKING A WETSUIT Never be tempted to swim in a wetsuit that’s not specifically designed for swimming. It won’t have articulated shoulders, and fighting the fabric with every arm recovery will drain your arms and shoulders of energy very quickly. A quick Google search will tell you which companies make swimming wetsuits: among the main brands are 2XU, Aqua Sphere, Ironman, Orca and Speedo, but there are lots of others. Decide on your price point, and try on as many as you can. It’s really worth visiting a

won’t be able to push off. Starting to swim from a motionless beginning places much greater demands on your fitness and technique than an ordinary turn. Putting a few short turns like this into your training is a good way to vary your sessions. Open-water acclimatisation Although you can train for an open-water swim in the pool, try to include at least a few open-water swims in the lead-up to your event. Not only that, also try to make sure the open water you train in is similar to event conditions. For example, there are fewer benefits to training in a river or lake if your event’s going to be in the ocean. Key things to bear in mind include: 1 Water temperature: Some open-water events do not allow wetsuits, even --- Page 169 Text --- though they take place in relatively cold water. The Channel swim is one example, but there are plenty of other, shorter ones. Cold water is particularly tricky to get used to, and the process can take months of acclimatisation. At the start, you may only be able to manage a minute in the water. The only consolation is that your body does adapt, and it does get easier. Warmer water than you’re used to also poses problems, but adaptation is less painful! You can mimic the effects of warm water by pool swimming in a wetsuit. 2 Water conditions: The open-water racing at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships in Melbourne was an event for the tough nuts, among the tough world of open-water racing. The competitors had to swim through large blooms of jellyfish, and some of the favourites failed even to finish. It’s an extreme example, but it does show that open-water swimmers need to be ready to face unexpected challenges, including waves,

QUALITY Whenever you’re doing any of the exercises or drills in this book (or any others that you’ve developed for yourself), try to make an active decision not to go fast. There’s an old saying that applies here: ‘First, do it. Then, do it right. Last, do it fast.’ Technique work falls into the second category: do it right. If you try to add speed, it will detract from your ability to control your movements with precision. Top tip --- Page 177 Text --- For most people, it’s worthwhile getting an experienced coach to provide an analysis of your style, and give you key areas for improvement. Try to limit these to three key elements, for example: 1 KEEP YOUR HEAD ANGLE LOWER, BY LOOKING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL RATHER THAN AHEAD 2 PLACE YOUR HAND IN THE WATER IN FRONT OF YOUR SHOULDER 3 STOP BENDING YOUR KNEES WHEN YOU KICK Think about the three key improvements whenever you swim, rather than only when you are specifically working on your technique. Session 1 Duration • 20–30 minutes This session focuses on improving the side-to-side roll of your body as you take each stroke. Concentrate on smooth transitions from one side to the other. Warm up Swim 400m, broken down into: • 50m front crawl • 50m butterfly drill • 50m front crawl • 50m backstroke, concentrating on rolling your body with each arm stroke • 50m front crawl • 50m breaststroke • 100m front crawl Set 1 • 4 × 50m, with a 15-second gap between each 50m Do the kick–breathe drill.

Focus on keeping your ear cushioned on your --- Page 178 Text --- shoulder, and make sure you’re seeing the deck of the pool as a vertical line (i.e. your head is flat in the water, rather than tilting up). • 2 × 50m, 15-second gap Swim full stroke at a steady pace, rolling your body into a similar position as the one you were just using during the drill. Set 2 • 4 × 50m, with a 20-second gap between each 50m Move to the progression version of the first drill. Because you’re breathing every three strokes, this may be more tiring: if 20 seconds rest isn’t enough, take longer. Use your vision to assess the angle and movement of your head. Your sight should sweep across the direction in which you’re swimming. Imagine a line perpendicular to your line of travel, crossing it at the point where your eyes look straight down at the bottom of the pool. If your vision follows this line, your head is turning from side to side without lifting. Warm down It’s a good idea to throw in something different for a warm-down: • 4 × 25m flutter-kick drill • 4 × 25m alternating Tarzan-and-Jane with full stroke Session 2 Duration • 20–30 minutes This session focuses on two elements of front crawl style: improving your breathing and making your leg kick more efficient.

has never been for me as I have always preferred to have the freedom to do things my way and in a manner that I believe in–devoid of politics and committee decisions. With freedom, though, comes risk as a self-employed coach, and without doubt I have to credit this entrepreneurial spirit to both my dad, Shaun, and my step-dad, Stephen, who have both shown me the organisation, mindful planning, tenacity, will to succeed and, above all, a love for their craft, which has been so important in my development as an independent coach. My dad and my sister Sheryl’s love of graphics, animations, text / fonts and visually stimulating displays of colour and motion in their line of work has also arguably had a massive impact on my desire to make Swim Smooth a visually attractive learning tool. After all, if a picture paints a thousand words, imagine what an animation can do! Many things have led me to where I am at this point in my coaching career but none so interesting as how I came to meet my now business partner, Adam Young, on an internet site no less! Shortly after I released the original Swim Smooth website in December 2004, my attention was brought to a popular triathlon forum in the UK called TriTalk. People write in and discuss various matters pertaining to triathlon, with some of the more hotly ‘debated’ areas being that of correct swimming technique. Between 2005 and 2007 I had been a regular poster to the site under the ‘avatar’ of ‘Swim Smooth’, and aimed to help a wide range of swimmers and triathletes solve their swimming inefficiency woes. On the forum at the same time was someone going by the pseudonym ‘Younggun’ who posted some excellent advice about cycling and running. We

Michelle has witnessed the rapid growth that Swim Smooth has achieved in the last three years as I partnered with Adam, and, as a well-respected physiotherapist herself, is primarily responsible for my knowledge and desire to know more about the anatomy of the shoulder joint, which helps to prevent and cure shoulder pain in swimmers. Without Michelle, none of this would be possible and I thank her for the love and patience that she continually shows me. Here’s to smoother swimming for everyone! —Paul Newsome Perth, Western Australia, November 2011 Adam Young Whilst trying to avoid this becoming a mutual back-slapping piece between us two authors, I simply have to say that Paul’s passion and extreme talent as a swimming --- Page 17 Text --- coach were obvious to me the first time that I saw him at work on a Swim Smooth Clinic way back in 2007. A few months later when I came to visit his squads in Perth, the latent potential of his coaching methods were so apparent that I felt determined we should take them to the world. Paul, thanks for trusting me and my own ideas, the brilliant insight you offer into swimming, the laughs on the pool deck, the shared journey, and all the 4:15am alarm clocks! Most of all thanks for the chance to work on something important – I wouldn’t change anything for the world. There are many great things about Australia but perhaps the best is how open and welcoming Aussies are to new arrivals.

Smooth, we have tried to keep the technical jargon to a minimum and made our programme as easy to understand as possible, keeping things in a form you can easily apply to your stroke. The graphics and pictures have been selected to be engaging and insightful, and lead you through the topics as if we were coaching you face to face. If we start talking about ‘smiley faces painted on the palms of your hands’ or ‘kebab sticks running down the length of your spine’, we are doing so as a simple way of translating the complex biomechanics of an efficient freestyle stroke into something you can easily apply to your own swimming. In the book we make extensive use of such ‘visualisations’ to simplify areas of the freestyle stroke that many swimmers have historically found quite hard to interpret. Swim Smooth has a very visual coaching style and we know that our swimmers love this approach and find it a refreshing way to learn. Even if you are at an advanced level in your swimming, you will find our approach motivating and you will really benefit from decluttering some of the thought processes involved so that you can become more focused and take your swimming to the next level. From time to time we will recommend equipment and training aids that we find significantly benefit the swimmers and triathletes that we work with on a daily basis. We have been fortunate enough to have tried most of the swimming products on the market – some great and some not so great – and you can be assured that anything we feature gets our full seal of approval and is well worth considering for your own swimming – see Chapter 3. Please do not feel the need to rush out

into a simple step-by-step process for you to follow (Appendix B) that is highly tailored to your individual needs. Before leaving Stroke Technique we will take you through a special feature showing you how to perform a video analysis on your own swimming and how to identify common flaws in your stroke. Referring you to the right section of this book we will highlight how to work on and fix those flaws, making your swimming more comfortable, more efficient and faster too. Very highly recommended! Swim Specific Fitness Training (Key 2) shows you how you should best train for distance swimming events such as open water swims and triathlon. Fitness from other sports rarely carries over very well to swimming, and developing your aerobic fitness in the water will make a huge difference to your comfort and speed in the water. It will also help you to sustain a better stroke technique as you swim and so improve your efficiency too. This section works in tandem with Appendix C, which contains hundreds of combinations of training sessions for you to follow. --- Page 21 Text --- To complete the section on training, we examine specific flexibility and conditioning work to improve your swimming posture and also avoid injury. The exercises in this section perfectly complement everything we cover in Keys 1–3 and will be essential if you suffer from any pain or injury during or after swimming. Open Water Skills (Key 3) explains how to prepare for open water swimming so as to have a confident, comfortable and fast race! Removing anxiety, drafting techniques, sighting and navigation are all included in detail. You can develop and practise these skills in the pool as well as the open water, in fact there are some advantages to doing so in the pool.

cap and beep to you a lap-pace or stroke rate as you swim. 6. Finis Tempo Trainer Pro and Wetronome – being able to accurately control your stroke rate in the pool and pace yourself well are two key swimming skills that do not come naturally to many swimmers. You programme these small ‘beepers’ and then put them under your swim cap when you swim; they then beep a target pace per 100 m to you (a beep for every time that you should be at each 25 m marker) or in stroke rate mode, a beep for every single stroke. This sounds very basic but the power of these devices cannot be over-estimated. Firstly, they help to motivate you through training sets and also let you focus on the swimming rather than watching the clock all the time. At the same time they develop your pacing skills, which is a huge advantage in races as nearly every swimmer starts too fast and then slows down – by pacing things correctly you will perform much better overall. In fact you may set some PBs the very first time you swim with one in lap- interval mode for just that reason! In stroke rate mode they give you subtle control over your swimming, allowing you to lift or lower your stroke rate to find the efficiency sweet spots in your stroke.

conventional paddles work on the assumption that if you create a larger surface area for the hand to work against it will help you develop a greater catch and feel for the water. However, overuse of large paddles with poor technique can be very troublesome for your shoulders. They might also slow your stroke rate down to an unrealistically low rate and with swimming being limited more by technique than brute strength, the notion that you need to become stronger to swim faster is normally misguided. PT and Palm Paddles work as a direct opposite to a normal paddle in that their convex shape removes the sensation of a good catch and thus encourages you to bend your elbow more under the water to gain a better catch with the forearm. When used for the first time they really feel like your hands are slipping through the water but that is --- Page 37 Text --- precisely the point – remove the paddle after 50 m to 100 m and your sense of ‘feel for the water’ is greatly heightened. 8. Other Conventional Paddles – there is a huge range of the more conventional style of paddle available on the market, with new designs being created all the time. Conventional paddles still have a place in the kit bag of more advanced swimmers with good stroke technique and certainly the smaller ‘finger paddles’ (not shown) are great for developing a better initial catch. Avoid overuse of any paddle and be wary of the desire to become stronger by using them – it’s usually the stronger athletes, who need a little more finesse in their stroke, who tend to reach for the big dinner-plate paddles before anyone else in the squad. 9.

same time: With good breathing timing, the head slightly leads body rotation. Many swimmers, even some elite swimmers, turn the head a fraction later once the body is already rotated. If breathing to your right for example, the right arm will already be into its recovery phase over the top of the water before you start breathing. When viewed from the side of the pool this can look like the swimmer will knock their nose with their right shoulder as the arm comes over. Late breathing reduces the time available to inhale and makes breathing feel a little tense and hurried. TURNING YOUR HEAD AWAY FROM YOUR ARM This is a useful visualisation to help you improve your breathing timing. If you are about to breathe to your left then as your right hand passes your head and extends forwards, turn your head smoothly away from that arm. This should be one fluid motion with the head rotating as the hand enters the water. If you breathe late, you’ll still be trying to inhale as the top arm is about to enter the water. --- Page 58 Text --- The top sequence shows classic late breathing with the body rotated (1–2) before breathing high in the air (3). The bottom sequence shows good timing and technique with the head turning away to a low breathing position as the body rotates. It’s common for your breathing timing to be better on one side of your stroke than the other and in fact it is normally your preferred breathing side which has late timing! Although you may feel less comfortable breathing to your un-favoured side you will not have developed any bad habits there and so are likely to have better breathing technique, with better timing and less head lift. --- Page

front of the TV at home. Don’t rush things, it will take many weeks and months to loosen your ankles off by stretching them little and often using the stretches below. --- Page 68 Text --- Sitting Ankle Stretch ADAM: Many swimmers think that using fins (flippers) in training is cheating in some way. Nothing could be further from the truth – performing drills with a specific purpose using fins is a very important part of developing your stroke technique as they leave you free to focus on the drill rather than on how hard you need to kick to stay afloat! Did you know that fins can also improve your ankle flexibility and kicking technique at the same time? Any time you kick with fins on they place your feet into a plantar flexed position and so gradually stretch your ankles. They also force you to kick with a straighter leg action. You don’t want to become addicted to swimming with fins but performing a drill set or technique swim of around 400 m will help tune up your leg kick at the same time as you work on other areas of your stroke. Neat! In a seated position cross one leg over the top of the other and hold the foot firmly with the opposing hand. Gently pull the foot straighter, feeling the stretch across the top of the foot and along the shin. Hold for 30 seconds to a minute and then swap sides. As always when stretching use only light force and progress very gradually to avoid injury.

stretching use only light force and progress very gradually to avoid injury. A scissor kick adds a huge amount of drag, it’s like opening up a parachute behind you. --- OCR from Page 68 Image 1 --- int titi MG en Ea --- Page 69 Text --- Scissor Kicks A scissor kick is one of the most common stroke flaws. In fact our records show that approximately 70% of swimmers who attend a Swim Smooth Clinic have a scissor kick in their stroke. Parting the legs like this causes a lot of drag and harms a swimmer’s body position in the water. However, a scissor kick is rarely a problem with the kick itself, instead it’s normally caused by an arm crossing the centre line in front of the head or under the body. This ‘crossover’ causes a loss of balance for the swimmer who parts the legs in a scissoring action to maintain balance, often doing so unknowingly. Fixing the crossover (Chapter 10) will normally remove the scissor kick all by itself, even without any conscious action on behalf of the swimmer. 2-Beat Kicking Technique A 2-beat kick is used by some elite swimmers racing in the pool and open water. For every two arm strokes, two leg kicks are made. The kicks don’t provide much propulsion but they do help drive body rotation, which in turn helps drive the arm stroke. A 2-beat kick suits swimmers with a faster stroke rate style, such as the Swinger Swim Type. A great 2-beat leg kick is poetry in motion and whilst it looks simple is deceptively difficult to master. Generally speaking we only recommend 2-beat kicks for those swimmers with a refined Swinger style (Chapter 22). The Classic Overglider (left) uses a large knee bend to kick-start their stroke after

456–459). Worthington, Ohio: Bertec Corporation. --- Page 72 Text --- CHAPTER 10 Posture and Alignment When thinking about core stability we tend to think about the abdominals, lower back and hip region of the body. This area of the body was the subject of the core stability boom across the sports world in the mid to late 1990s. In swimming terms we would call this the ‘lower core’ and like in many sports, it plays an important role in the pool as we’ll investigate in this chapter. However, the ‘upper core’ – a swimmer’s thoracic spine, their shoulder and scapular region – is thought about much less often but is arguably even more important for good swimming technique. ADAM: One of my roles at Swim Smooth is to manage all of our swimming websites and I spend a lot of time in front of the computer doing this. Working at a computer draws the shoulders and head forwards, shortening the chest muscles and over-stretching between the shoulder blades. As we’ll see in this section, if you have an office job yourself this hunched posture could be doing your swimming real harm. Poor posture at work (left) can negatively impact your swimming but try to avoid over-exaggerating good posture (right) as this puts pressure on your lower back. When we swim we enter the water and extend forwards, the lead hand being controlled by the shoulder, chest and scapular region muscle groups. If your chest muscles are short and the muscles between your scapulae over-stretched, then this tends to draw the lead arm across the centre line of the body causing a crossover in front of the head. A crossover in front of the head is caused by poor swimming posture. --- Page 73 Text --- The solution to a crossover

between your scapulae over-stretched, then this tends to draw the lead arm across the centre line of the body causing a crossover in front of the head. A crossover in front of the head is caused by poor swimming posture. --- Page 73 Text --- The solution to a crossover is not to think about taking the arm wider. It is commonly said that you should be aiming for your hands to enter at ‘10 o’clock and 2 o’clock’ in order to correct a crossover, the theory being that thinking about going wider will result in you becoming straighter. All this would do though is reduce your body rotation and cause you to swim flatter in the water and over time your arms will have a tendency to move wider and wider! Instead of this, the solution to a crossover is to improve your posture by drawing your shoulder blades together and back. We can see in Figure 10.6 how this draws the lead arm straight and also promotes good body rotation. Try this yourself in a standing position. FIGURE 10.6 To remove a crossover pull your shoulder blades together and down to pull your arm straight. PAUL: When you were a child did your parents used to say to you ‘stand up tall and proud – shoulders back chest forwards!’? This is exactly what you need to do to improve your swimming posture. At Swim Smooth we call swimming with your shoulders down and back ‘swimming proud’! If you have a crossover in your stroke or you lack body rotation then it’s very likely that you need to work on your swimming posture in this way.

have a crossover in your stroke or you lack body rotation then it’s very likely that you need to work on your swimming posture in this way. Improving your posture will also increase the length of your stroke as it helps you extend forward much straighter, this is of direct benefit to your swimming efficiency. We will take a good look at some exercises and drills in this section to help you tune in to this part of your --- Page 74 Text --- stroke and we’ll recommend some simple stretches to help loosen off your chest and shoulders in Chapter 29. Transferring Power from Your Rotation to Your Arm Stroke Hopefully you can see how your upper core helps connect your arm stroke to your body. Swimming with good posture forms a strong connection between the two and lets you utilise the larger muscle groups of the chest and upper back to help drive the arm stroke. Swimming with poor posture tends to overload the weaker shoulder muscle groups, which will quickly fatigue. Having a stable upper core, combined with a good catch and rotation technique will really help you to generate some controlled power in the stroke. PAUL: The good news here is that you do not need to be physically strong to swim well, this is one reason why that 11-year-old girl can go zooming past you in the pool with very little upper-body strength. The key is to get in the right positions with a good stroke rhythm and that will produce the necessary power with surprisingly little feeling of force. Developing Better Posture in the Pool At Swim Smooth we like to use drills that involve kicking on your side to improve your posture.

stroke rhythm and that will produce the necessary power with surprisingly little feeling of force. Developing Better Posture in the Pool At Swim Smooth we like to use drills that involve kicking on your side to improve your posture. Many swimmers have performed similar drills before but normally think of them as rotational drills or something to improve their leg kick. However, the focus here is less about your rotation and more about your posture. Start off by performing the Kick On Side Drill described in Appendix A. Use a pair of fins (flippers) and kick gently to propel you down the pool, extending the lower arm out in front of you. Notice how aligned or otherwise your lead hand is, does it cross the centre line? This is a clear indication of what is happening with that arm in your full freestyle stroke too. Do you find you drift across the lane in the direction of the crossover? Think about bringing this arm straight by drawing your shoulder blades together and down. You should track much straighter when you get this right. Perform the drill looking straight down past your armpit exhaling in a long stream of bubbles. When you need a breath, rotate your head to the side and then return it to the water again. Keep your lead arm perfectly straight while you breathe and do not let it drop down in the water. The other arm should remain relaxed by your side as though your hand was in the front pocket of a pair of jeans. Side kicking with fins is the primary drill for working on your posture: Draw your shoulder blades together and down to bring the lead arm straight. --- Page 75 Text --- After 25m swap onto the other side. Repeat the

was in the front pocket of a pair of jeans. Side kicking with fins is the primary drill for working on your posture: Draw your shoulder blades together and down to bring the lead arm straight. --- Page 75 Text --- After 25m swap onto the other side. Repeat the exercise here, working on drawing your arm straight in front of you. It’s well worthwhile performing these exercises with a coach or friend watching you from the pool deck to give you feedback on your alignment. This Kick On Side Drill makes you aware of the alignment of your lead hand when you swim and it helps you tune into developing a better swimming posture. When you feel you have got the hang of this you can progress to the 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills. The 6-1-6 Drill involves kicking on your side again for around six kicks. Then perform one arm stroke to swap sides and kick on that side for six further kicks before swapping back again. This is a more challenging drill because you have got to maintain your posture during an arm stroke. Watch that you don’t crossover as you enter into the water and then straighten it up, you’re aiming to enter straight in the first place! Again, feedback from an observer is very useful here. The 6-3-6 Drill is slightly harder again and involves taking three full arm strokes between side kicking. You should start to feel the power coming into your stroke now as your improved posture helps drive the stroke. ADAM: In the Swim Smooth squads in Perth we perform a lot of these side kicking drills. They really help you maintain your stroke, simultaneously working on your posture, and as we will see later, helping you set up for a good catch

your improved posture helps drive the stroke. ADAM: In the Swim Smooth squads in Perth we perform a lot of these side kicking drills. They really help you maintain your stroke, simultaneously working on your posture, and as we will see later, helping you set up for a good catch too. One quick pointer on 6-1-6: make sure you breathe after the stroke not before. You could think of the drill as: 6-1-breathe-6. Once you’ve tried the side kicking exercises perform some full-stroke swimming using the Middle Finger Visualisation described in Chapter 12. Focus on entering into the water and extending your middle finger gun-barrel straight down the pool in front of --- Page 76 Text --- the same shoulder. If you own a pair of the excellent Finis Freestyler Paddles (see Chapter 3) you can also perform some swimming using them. These have a keel on the bottom of the paddle, which gives you kinaesthetic feedback on how straight you are in the water – crossover and you’ll feel them trying to spin off to that side! As you introduce arm strokes, maintain a focus on your lead arm staying straight and aligned. PAUL: Take the time to carefully read the pointers for these exercises in Appendix A. When you feel like you can perform them quite well, really aim to perfect them with perfect rotation (45° to 60° during the strokes and side kicking at 90°), perfect alignment and a good hand position out in front of you. Stay relaxed and keep exhaling smoothly and continuously into the water. THE 1-2-STRAIGHT MANTRA As you develop your swimming posture you may find that you stay well aligned on normal strokes but on a breathing stroke your crossover returns. This is only natural as during a breathing stroke your focus

Stay relaxed and keep exhaling smoothly and continuously into the water. THE 1-2-STRAIGHT MANTRA As you develop your swimming posture you may find that you stay well aligned on normal strokes but on a breathing stroke your crossover returns. This is only natural as during a breathing stroke your focus tends to shift towards ‘get that air in’! To help you stay straight whilst breathing repeat to yourself ‘1 - 2 - straight - 1 - 2 - straight....’ The 1 and 2 fall on normal strokes and the straight on a breathing stroke, which will help keep your focus on that lead hand during the breath. Other Posture Drills The Broken Arrow Drill described in Appendix A is ideal for swimmers with tight shoulders and upper backs. The drill has a similar timing to 6-1-6 but the recovering arm is taken vertically and paused there for a second. The elbow is then bent to at least 90° before the hand spears into the water. To perfect the drill, as the arm reaches the vertical position consciously relax the shoulder and feel it sink back down into its socket. This will help you loosen off your upper back and shoulder muscles ready for moving back to full-stroke swimming. Lower Core Stability --- OCR from Page 76 Image 1 --- ~~" Cele et weer i ae? oF {.. oo “Pe = ee — walt ores Petes Sayan --- Page 77 Text --- The ‘lower core’ of your hips, lower back and abdominal area is important in swimming to keep you straight in the water and to help rotate your hips and shoulders together as one.

abdominal area is important in swimming to keep you straight in the water and to help rotate your hips and shoulders together as one. Good core control during swimming has a slightly different feel to it compared to other sports, which can cause some confusion. The key to developing your lower core control is to feel a stretch between your pelvis and rib cage as you swim. In a sense you are trying to separate out the two as much as possible, raising the chest away from the hips. If you try this you will feel your posture improve at the same time as your chest is pushed out and your shoulders come back – great! Warning: avoid holding your breath when you do this. Michael Phelps has one of the best streamline positions in the world. See the Torpedo Kick and Swim Back Drill in Appendix A to see how to get into this position yourself. If you suffer from low-lying legs in the water the first benefit you may notice from improving your core control is that your legs are lifted higher so you slip through the water more easily. That’s a great sign that you’ve made a substantial improvement to your stroke! At Swim Smooth we use several visualisations to help you use your lower core in the right way: --- Page 78 Text --- TORPEDO KICK WITH FINS Kick continuously either on your front or back with your arms above your head in a torpedo position. The streamlined tuck requires you to stabilise your upper back and also stretches your shoulders and chest. Perform 50 m to 100 m at a time with fins on. Whenever you start any lap of freestyle you are aiming for a nice strong push-off in a streamlined tuck (see Appendix

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
The streamlined tuck requires you to stabilise your upper back and also stretches your shoulders and chest. Perform 50 m to 100 m at a time with fins on. Whenever you start any lap of freestyle you are aiming for a nice strong push-off in a streamlined tuck (see Appendix A). This is the perfect time to focus on your lower core using the visualisations below. As you break out in to your freestyle maintain that focus down the lap to integrate the ‘core engagement’ into your full stroke. STICK OF LIQUORICE STRETCH A nice way to think about stretching through the core is to imagine a stick of liquorice that is attached to your pelvis at one end and to your rib cage at the other. As you swim you must keep the liquorice stretched at all times! BUM CHEEK SQUEEZE! A slightly crude visualisation this one – imagine that you have a pound or dollar coin between the cheeks of your backside and to keep it there you must lightly squeeze your glute (buttock) muscles! This exercise also helps you kick more from the hip than the knee as the glute muscles are activated. TILTING PELVIS UPWARDS Think about rotating your pelvis upwards slightly (technical term: anterior tilt) so that your tail-bone is pulled up a little towards your lower back. Think about drawing your rib cage away from your hips as you swim by stretching tall through your core. --- Page 79 Text --- As essential as good lower core control is to your stroke technique, we can easily forget about it when we swim. An excellent way to remind yourself is to use a good torpedo push-off (also known as a streamline) at the beginning of every length which involves stretching through your core. Doing this

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
the more specifically you can introduce good core control into your normal swim sessions the better. PAUL: Just to prove this point, it’s normally the gym junkies who can do hundreds of sit-ups who have the worst core control in the water! For more information on dry-land conditioning that you can adopt within your programme in a time efficient way, see Chapters 29 and 30. --- Page 80 Text --- CHAPTER 11 Rotation and Arm Recovery Body rotation (sometimes simply called ‘body roll’) is the rotation of the swimmer along the long axis of the spine as they swim. A good freestyle stroke technique has between 45° and 60° of rotation to each side on every stroke, not just when they breathe. This helps the swimmer use the large muscle groups of the core, back and chest to help drive the stroke. A swimmer with poor rotation tends to overuse the small weak shoulder muscles, which soon fatigue. A swimmer should rotate between 45° and 60° on every stroke they take. --- Page 81 Text --- THE KEBAB STICK VISUALISATION Imagine that your body has been skewered on a kebab stick, running through your head and body down to your feet. As the kebab stick is rotated your body rotates as one with the legs, hips and shoulders rotating together. Rotate ‘as one’ along your long axis, as if you were skewered on a kebab stick! Many swimmers feel they should kick vertically at all times when they swim but this misconception can really harm your rotation. Instead you should kick with your rotation: Mr Smooth’s kick also rotates with his body roll. Developing Good Rotation --- Page 82 Text --- To develop your rotation use the Kick-On-Side, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drill sequences from Appendix A as described in Chapter

this misconception can really harm your rotation. Instead you should kick with your rotation: Mr Smooth’s kick also rotates with his body roll. Developing Good Rotation --- Page 82 Text --- To develop your rotation use the Kick-On-Side, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drill sequences from Appendix A as described in Chapter 10 on Swimming Posture. Swimming posture and rotation are heavily related and by swimming with your shoulders back and chest forwards you will naturally drive better rotation into your stroke. PAUL: It should be stressed that when the body rotates with each stroke the head should stay stationary and not move with the rotation of the shoulders (with the obvious exception of rotating to breathe). It is very common to see people move their head around on every stroke when they’re trying to develop their rotation but this adds drag and may cause dizziness or even nausea, especially in turbulent open water. Follow the same process outlined in Chapters 10 and 13 and become accustomed to being on your side, whilst focusing on swimming with good alignment of the lead hand and a good hand position facing downward with the elbow higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips. Kicking in this position may feel very strange to you at first but will build your confidence in it. As you move to the 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills you will get practice at rotating from one side of the body to the other. When you are ready, remove the fins and swim some laps of freestyle focusing solely on maintaining that sensation of reaching and rolling with each stroke, always being mindful of maintaining good alignment and not crossing over. Focus on stretching forwards with the lead arm as you press the other hand underneath the water towards

up and down the tube, making a loud ‘click’ when it hits the end. The ball bearing will only slide and hit the end of the tube if you are rotating sufficiently. If you’re struggling to develop your rotation, the Tech Toc is a very worthwhile investment in your swimming. --- Page 83 Text --- The Finis Tech Toc is a great tool to help you develop your body rotation. Taking Rotation too Far Whilst good rotation is important, you can take it too far. In the 1990s many swimmers were taught to ‘stack their shoulders’ by trying to rotate to a full 90° in an effort to swim more ‘fish like’; incredibly you will still hear this advice offered in some places on the internet today. In full-stroke freestyle swimming you should avoid rotating to 90° at all costs as it will cause you to lose balance and want to topple onto your back. To regain your balance you will need to part your legs and so create a large amount of drag – like opening a parachute – at the rear of your stroke. Whilst some of the Swim Smooth drills have you kicking in a side-lying position, when you transition into your freestyle stroke you are only ever looking for 45° to 60° of rotation. --- Page 84 Text --- ROTATE THE HIP AHEAD OF THE HANDS VISUALISATION As you swim and your hand comes through and past your chest and stomach, visualise rotating your hip out of the way, maintaining a healthy gap between the two. See Figure 11.7. FIGURE 11.7 Rotate the hips out of the way ahead of the stroking arm. Keep the effort in the arm stroke moderate and emphasise the hip rotation instead. This is an excellent visualisation for helping you time

of the way, maintaining a healthy gap between the two. See Figure 11.7. FIGURE 11.7 Rotate the hips out of the way ahead of the stroking arm. Keep the effort in the arm stroke moderate and emphasise the hip rotation instead. This is an excellent visualisation for helping you time the catch, pull and exit phase to your body rotation, which we will discuss more in Chapter 13. The Importance of Good Rotation in Your Stroke Good rotation also serves several other purposes: 1. It allows the recovering arms to travel freely over the surface of the water. 2. It reduces the load on the shoulders, lowering the chances of shoulder injury. --- Page 85 Text --- 3. A rotated body cuts through the water more cleanly, producing less drag than a flat profile. 4. It helps the large muscles of the core, chest and back drive the arm stroke, increasing propulsive power. You can experience points one and two by lying on your front and then your side on land (Figure 11.8). Start on your front without any rotation and your arms down by your side. Try and recover your arms to the front of the stroke without rotation and see how awkward it feels; even if you are super flexible in the shoulders this will be a real struggle. FIGURE 11.8 Comparison of arm clearance over the water with poor rotation (top) and very good rotation (bottom). Now try the same thing from a side-lying position with your lead arm out in front giving you support. Notice how easy it feels now to recover the top arm to the front and how relaxed the shoulder is.

When elite pool swimmers perform a classic high elbow recovery, or --- OCR from Page 85 Image 1 --- el | decked oa e 1 ee joadnal (arene teen bt Lay --- Page 86 Text --- when elite open water swimmers achieve good clearance with their recovering arm in rough water, they do this with the combination of good shoulder mobility and good body rotation. If you struggle with an awkward recovery over the water, work on improving your body roll and your recovery will also improve and take some of the load off your shoulders that you may normally experience. Poor body rotation and stiff shoulders mean an awkward recovery round the side of the body for this swimmer. Low Awkward Arm Recovery The classic problem with arm recovery occurs when the swimmer struggles for clearance over the water. This makes the freestyle stroke quite awkward and causes the hand to lead the elbow during the recovery. A low awkward recovery is caused either by poor posture and shoulder flexibility or a lack of body rotation in the stroke. If you struggle with your arm recovery over the water, work on improving both your swimming posture and rotation (Chapters 10 and 11), the combination of which will make your recovery much easier and more relaxed. If you struggle with your arm recovery make sure you try the exercise shown in Figure 11.8 to experience the difference better body rotation will make to your swimming. A Drill

using a classic high elbow technique while others use varying degrees of straighter arm recoveries. In the open water nearly all swimmers use a straighter arm recovery style which helps increase their arm clearance over waves and chop and also other swimmers in close proximity to them. PAUL: When I ask swimmers what is the most important aspect of good freestyle technique many will reply ‘high elbows!’ As we’ll see though this isn’t necessarily the case. For swimmers with tight shoulder muscles or those racing in open water, a slightly straighter arm recovery would be a better option. Swimmers favouring a higher stroke rate also naturally favour a straighter arm recovery with the arms swinging a little more around the side. As we’ll discuss in the Swim Type section of this book, we call this style of stroke The Swinger for exactly that reason. Swingers can be incredibly fast and efficient swimmers even though this style of stroke has traditionally been given a bad press in the swimming world. Experimenting with a Straighter Arm Recovery --- Page 88 Text --- If you are tight in the upper back and shoulders, or you are focused on racing well in open water, then experiment with some laps of freestyle using a slightly straighter arm than you are used to. Simply open out the elbow to different angles and see how it feels. You can expect it to feel strange at first but also notice how relaxed or otherwise the recovery feels. A straighter arm recovery really comes into its own in open water swims, helping you clear chop and wake from other swimmers. ADAM: Swimmers trying a straighter arm recovery for the first time often say that it feels strange and fear that it must look terrible! As a coach I work

straighter arm recovery really comes into its own in open water swims, helping you clear chop and wake from other swimmers. ADAM: Swimmers trying a straighter arm recovery for the first time often say that it feels strange and fear that it must look terrible! As a coach I work with swimmers trying this all the time and I can tell you that it doesn’t look anywhere near as extreme as it feels at first. Give it a bit of a try out in your own swimming, particularly if you suffer from a low awkward arm recovery. If you are a triathlete or open water swimmer racing in a wetsuit you may have found in the past that the restriction of the wetsuit causes your shoulders to become fatigued when swimming. Some go to the extreme of feeling they need to switch to a sleeveless suit (which has more drag) or even hit the weights in the gym to get stronger in the shoulders. But again, a straighter arm recovery may help reduce the fatigue in your shoulders and is well worth experimenting with. If you watch an elite triathlon swim leg you’ll see that most elite triathletes use a straighter arm recovery style to great effect. --- Page 89 Text --- CHAPTER 12 Hand Entry How your hands enter into the water at the front of the stroke might not sound important but it can make a large difference to how well you swim and also the chances of you suffering from shoulder injury.

you suffering from shoulder injury. There are three elements to a good hand entry: 1) Hand Angle The hand should enter into the water at a slight downward angle with the palm facing down towards the water’s surface. We call this a ‘fingertip-first entry’ as the fingertips are the first part of your hand to spear into the water. This angle of entry pierces through the surface of the water nicely and immediately gets you in a great position for a good catch as you start the stroke at the front. Unfortunately, in some parts of the world you can still find an alternative style of hand entry taught where the palm faces outwards and the thumb enters the water first. This is called a ‘thumb-first entry’. This swimmer displays an excellent fingertip-first entry into the water. Avoid a thumb-first entry, it is very bad for your shoulders and after entering the water your hand will tend to slice down in the water instead of engaging with it for the catch to follow. --- Page 90 Text --- Thumb-First Entry. Warning: this can seriously harm your shoulders! During the 1970s swimmers were taught to enter into the water thumb first with the palm facing outwards. The idea was to create a cleaner hand entry into the water with less resistance but rotating the hand outwards in this manner internally rotates the shoulder, placing a twisting load on it. Some swimming coaches and websites still recommend using a thumb-first entry but we now understand that because it internally rotates the shoulder, it is the leading cause of shoulder injury in swimming and should be strongly avoided for this reason. If you’ve had a shoulder injury or are currently suffering from one, you’ll find our additional advice on this subject in Chapter

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
we now understand that because it internally rotates the shoulder, it is the leading cause of shoulder injury in swimming and should be strongly avoided for this reason. If you’ve had a shoulder injury or are currently suffering from one, you’ll find our additional advice on this subject in Chapter 30 very useful. A thumb-first entry is also less effective in setting you up for a good catch as the hand tends to continue slicing down into the water after it has entered rather than engaging with the water at the front of your stroke. PAUL: If you’re serious about your swimming performances then you need to take every measure you can to avoid injury. I’ve been coaching swimmers of all levels for nearly 15 years and in that time it’s become very clear to me that consistency in preparation and training is the single most important factor in swimmers achieving their goals. Time out recovering from a shoulder injury will set you back significantly and you will lose the peak of fitness you would otherwise have achieved. You may have been swimming for many years and you may not wish to take the time and effort to change from a thumb-first to a fingertip-first hand entry but please understand the very high risk you are taking with the health of your shoulders by not doing so. Changing to a fingertip entry does take some time and persistence but it is so important to guarantee you a long and happy swimming career. Here are two useful visualisations you can use to help remove a thumb-first entry from your stroke: Visualise hiding your palm from someone watching you from the side of the pool, as if someone’s written a rude word on it!

swimming career. Here are two useful visualisations you can use to help remove a thumb-first entry from your stroke: Visualise hiding your palm from someone watching you from the side of the pool, as if someone’s written a rude word on it! As your hand recovers over the surface of the water you will have a tendency to turn the hand outwards to create the thumb-first position but this would mean showing your palm to that person on the pool deck, don’t do it! Visualise carrying a briefcase in your hand as you recover over the water. You cannot turn your hand outwards because that would mean rotating the briefcase – --- Page 91 Text --- keep it straight as you swim! 2) Hand Entry Point If you stand and hold one arm straight out in front of you and practise entering with the other, the hand should enter somewhere between the wrist and the elbow of the outstretched arm. This is a good guide for most swimmers but some, particularly elite open water swimmers, like to reach a little further forwards before entering into the water. This can be a useful adaptation to make to your stroke for rougher open water swimming. If your other hand was outstretched, the hand should enter somewhere between the distance of your elbow and wrist. Wherever you enter into the water the most important thing is that the hand should spear in cleanly and enter before the elbow. If you overreach and the elbow collapses in first this will harm the catch phase of the stroke that follows. A good exercise for practising a spearing hand entry is the Shoulder Tap Drill shown in Appendix A. With fins on, tap yourself on the shoulder before entering into the water using fingertip-first entry (palm

elbow collapses in first this will harm the catch phase of the stroke that follows. A good exercise for practising a spearing hand entry is the Shoulder Tap Drill shown in Appendix A. With fins on, tap yourself on the shoulder before entering into the water using fingertip-first entry (palm facing down). The shoulder tap slows things down and gives you time to think and to ensure that you are entering from a high position angled downward. As you’ll see in the full drill description, breathe on every single stroke (both to the left and right) when performing Shoulder Tap and leave the other arm outstretched for balance. If you overreach on hand entry you will drop your elbow in first. --- Page 92 Text --- SPEARING FISH VISUALISATION To practice a positive hand entry into the water, imagine there’s a fish swimming in the water around 30 cm or 1 ft in front of you. As you swim, visualise spearing the fish as your enter the water with your hand like the blade of a spear. Enter with a big splash and you scare the fish away and disrupt the smoothness of your stroke. Enter cleanly, smoothly and stealthily and you will catch that fish! This is a simple but powerful way to focus on a clean hand entry and can be used at any time when you’re swimming or racing. A crossover in front of the head is seen in about 70% of attendees on our Swim Smooth Clinics. 3) Alignment Straight in Front of the Same Shoulder As your hand enters the water and extends forwards it should be perfectly in line with your shoulder.

Clinics. 3) Alignment Straight in Front of the Same Shoulder As your hand enters the water and extends forwards it should be perfectly in line with your shoulder. This keeps you tracking straight and sets you up for a good catch as you start the following stroke. This sounds simple but in reality very few beginner and intermediate level swimmers have good alignment in the water; most cross over the centre line to a greater or lesser extent as their hands enter and extend. As we saw in Chapter 10 on swimming posture, the key here is to draw your shoulder blades together and back to enter and extend straight forward in front of the same shoulder. --- Page 93 Text --- MIDDLE FINGER VISUALISATION A useful visualisation to improve your alignment on hand entry is to simply focus on the middle finger on each hand as it enters the water and extends forward. Think about that middle finger as you swim and nothing else, extending it straight down the pool as if you are aiming the barrel of a gun. ADAM: Entering and extending forward straight in front of the same shoulder sounds easy but it is something that could well be holding you back with your swimming. This is an area of swimming technique where visualisations are very powerful. Memorise how our animated swimmer Mr Smooth looks from the underside angle extending straight and aligned – if you haven’t done so already you can download him for free from www.swimsmooth.com.

Jono has fantastic alignment and provides a great visual image for you to keep in mind as you swim. To help overcome a crossover, visualise Mr Smooth extending straight forward in front of the same shoulder as he swims. PAUL: Don’t underestimate the damage a crossover does to your swimming: it causes you to snake or ‘fish tail’ down the pool, creates a scissor kick in your stroke and ruins your catch on the water. A crossover can also place stress on your shoulder, increasing the risk of shoulder injury particularly in combination with a thumb-first entry. It will also make swimming straight in the open water very challenging. In summary, a crossover adds a huge amount of drag, ruins your propulsion and could stop you swimming completely through injury – pretty serious! Ask a friend or coach to check if you are crossing over the centre line in front of your head, even momentarily. If you do you should make fixing it an immediate priority. Using Paddles to Work on Hand Entry The added surface area of a pair of paddles can be a great way to feel how you are entering into the water. Any paddle will be useful for this but we highly recommend the Finis Freestyler Paddle as its unique shape (like the blade of a spear) gives you --- Page 94 Text --- immediate feedback on how straight you are entering. So much so that if you cross over or drop your elbow on entry then you’ll have trouble keeping them on your hands! The Finis Freestyler, a great paddle for working on your alignment

his elbow and tipping his wrist – great technique. ADAM: Many swimming coaches consider working on the catch and pull-through to be for advanced level swimmers only. At Swim Smooth we passionately believe that this is not the case! Approached in the right way, making improvements to your catch can be achieved quite easily and these changes will benefit your stroke technique as a whole. As we’ll see with our Swim Types system, many beginner swimmers have very poor feel for the water and lack any ‘oomph’ in their stroke rhythm. If you struggle to feel the water at all at the front of your stroke then developing a better catch is critical to help you progress. Let’s examine the movements of a good catch and pull-through step by step. By following the advice in the early steps of this chapter you will already have some of --- Page 96 Text --- these elements in place in your stroke: The hand enters the water cleanly using a spearing hand entry with the fingertips and palm facing downward. The arm extends straight forward, aligned with the shoulder. During arm extension the fingertips stay slightly lower than the wrist and the wrist slightly lower than the elbow at all times. The catch is initiated with a tipping of the wrist. This is momentary and easily missed when looking at video analysis of great swimmers. See Figure 13.9 for examples of this in elite swimmers’ strokes. --- OCR from Page 96 Image 3 --- ccccceuan BUCCUCRCCCeanetnenn --- Page 97 Text --- FIGURE 13.9 Examples of wrist tipping by elite swimmers, top-bottom: Mel Benson, Shelley Taylor-Smith, Rhys Mainstone.

water. Here are some examples of swimmers showing classic flaws in their catch technique. Notice how our animated swimmer maintains a high elbow in all these positions with the elbow higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips throughout: Ron pushes down on the water with a straight arm, this only lifts him up at the front and does not generate any forward propulsion. Greg crosses the centre line under his body, losing propulsion and his balance at the same time. Notice the scissor kick forming behind him as he has to stabilise himself. --- Page 101 Text --- Tim pulls through with a very straight arm under the body. This forces him to press down during the catch phase and overloads the weaker shoulder muscles. Henry drops his wrist and elbow and shows the palm forwards. Overgliders very often do this as they try to absolutely maximise stroke length. Tim drops his elbow just before the catch, from here he will find it nearly impossible to get his elbow up high for the catch to follow. The Limits of Flexibility If you have read a lot of material about swimming on the internet you might have come across the term Early Vertical Forearm or ‘EVF’ for short. This refers to some elite swimmers’ ability to achieve a very vertical forearm position early in the stroke in front of the head. This is technically very difficult to perform and requires a lot of flexibility and stability in the shoulder joint; for adult age-group swimmers and triathletes we recommend a less extreme position at this point in stroke. --- Page 102 Text --- See Figure 13.10 for a comparison of these positions, note that the elbow is still higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the

the shoulder joint; for adult age-group swimmers and triathletes we recommend a less extreme position at this point in stroke. --- Page 102 Text --- See Figure 13.10 for a comparison of these positions, note that the elbow is still higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips in a more conventional catching position. The conventional catch still creates a lot of propulsion and allows you to swim very quickly indeed. Olympic swimmer Jono Van Hazel who features in our Catch Masterclass DVD swam sub-50 seconds for 100m using such a catch, so there is no shortage of speed available! FIGURE 13.10 An extreme ‘EVF position’ (top) has the arm nearly vertical in front of the head. A conventional catch (bottom) has a less extreme vertical forearm. Your Strength and the Catch Referring to Figure 13.11 try the following practical exercise: FIGURE 13.11 Use a friend or coach to investigate your muscular recruitment in the catch position. --- Page 103 Text --- Position 1: Stand square on and face your friend with your arm locked straight out in front of you. Have them support your hand and press down on it hard. Notice how all the effort is coming from your shoulder muscles and how your friend does not struggle to resist you too much. This is not because you are not strong but because all the effort is coming from your shoulders, which are a relatively small, weak muscle group. This position demonstrates a poor catch technique with the swimmer pushing down on the water with a straight arm. Position 2: Standing in the same position, now bend your elbow and again push down on your friend’s hand. Notice how you are now starting to engage your back and chest muscle groups, which are stronger –

technique with the swimmer pushing down on the water with a straight arm. Position 2: Standing in the same position, now bend your elbow and again push down on your friend’s hand. Notice how you are now starting to engage your back and chest muscle groups, which are stronger – your friend should notice the increase in force you --- Page 104 Text --- can create here. However, we know that this position is still not correct as the elbow is dropped and the body is not rotated. Position 3: Rotate your feet and body to be more side-on to your friend and bend your elbow but keep it high so the elbow is higher than the wrist and the wrist is higher than the fingertips. In this position think about pressing the water back behind you rather than pushing it downward. Notice how you can really engage your chest and back muscles here and easily generate a lot of force. You will see from this position where the term ‘reaching over a barrel’ comes from. The key point with this exercise is to show you how a good catching position on the water allows you to use larger more powerful muscle groups. This makes it easy to generate the forces required during the catch. So easy in fact that when they start to get this right swimmers either pull too hard and overpower the catch or it feels too easy and they think it cannot be correct – surely a good catch should feel solid and hard? Actually a good catch is a relatively light connection with the water and should not feel overly forceful or hurried. One more thing to perfect this exercise. Did you notice in the third position that your shoulder was rolled inwards as shown

a good catch should feel solid and hard? Actually a good catch is a relatively light connection with the water and should not feel overly forceful or hurried. One more thing to perfect this exercise. Did you notice in the third position that your shoulder was rolled inwards as shown in the left hand pictures? As we discussed in Chapter 10 this is poor swimming posture. Whilst in this position think about drawing your shoulder blades together and your shoulders back and down. Notice how this really connects your arm to your body for a great catch! Developing Your Catch Step 1: Catch Set-up --- Page 105 Text --- Alignment and Posture The first step to developing your catch is to refer back to Chapter 10 where we looked at improving your alignment and posture in the water. Use the steps there to straighten out your stroke and ensure that you are entering the water and extending forward with the hand straight in front of the shoulder. If you cross over the centre line in your stroke then you will find it nearly impossible to catch and pull-through effectively on the following stroke. PAUL: A common mistake that I see many swimmers making is to rush straight to developing their catch mechanics – i.e. the bent elbow pull-through itself. Whilst this is important, if you don’t first focus on the stage in your stroke immediately before, developing your catch will be a fruitless and frustrating exercise for you. Take the time to improve your catch set-up using the tips in this section – they can make improvements to your propulsion even without focusing on the catch itself. Whilst performing the Kick-On-Side, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills, introduce a new focus on the position and angle of the lead hand itself. During

and a lot of propulsion is lost. Holding your fingers lightly together will allow you to swim very quickly and efficiently without the risks of slipping by trying to hold them slightly apart. The Exit at the Rear of the Stroke The push phase at the back of the stroke by the hip and thigh has been emphasised in many swim programmes around the world. Whilst it’s important to avoid finishing the stroke too early, many swimmers feel like they need to lock-out their elbow straight in an effort to really press through at the back of the stroke. The cue that you may have heard is to ‘brush the thumb against the thigh’. If the recovery phase of the freestyle stroke starts with the arm locked out straight, it will take place with a very internally rotated shoulder, which is a recipe for shoulder injury (also see Chapter 30). Nic is trying to maximise her stroke length with a distinct push at the back of her stroke – this is placing a lot of stress on her elbow joint and shoulder. --- Page 112 Text --- Above and below the water, note how elite swimmer Rhys Mainstone does not lock his arm out straight, he leaves the elbow slightly bent to start his arm recovery smoothly without a flick at the rear. Whilst less common than shoulder strain, some swimmers experience elbow pain when swimming. This pain is often referred to as ‘Golfer’s Elbow’ or to give it its medical term: medial epicondylitis. We have found from experience that the most common cause of Golfer’s Elbow in swimmers is a rapid snapping of the hand against the thigh from trying to really lengthen out the stroke at the back. Swimmers who do this can be seen to flick the

by developing an improved catch technique. This will give you a more fluid stroke and will also lift your stroke rate slightly, giving your swimming a renewed sense of rhythm. --- Page 115 Text --- UNCO DRILL The Unco drill is described fully in Appendix A and is a one-arm drill performed with the inactive arm resting by the swimmer’s side. Using fins is essential to propel you through the water as the active arm recovers over the top. Breathe on every stroke away from the stroking arm. The key to Unco is to emphasise your body rotation, particularly thinking about the shoulder of your inactive arm and dipping it down low into the water as the active arm recovers over the surface. A good mantra for the drill is ‘breathe and dip, breathe and dip . . .’ to help you remember to breathe away from the stroking arm and emphasise dipping the inactive shoulder and hip. PAUL: Australians are fond of shortening words and Unco is Aussie slang for uncoordinated! It’s quite an advanced drill and you may struggle with coordinating it at first, particularly if your stroke timing needs some work. The irony is that when you get this drill right it is anything but uncoordinated as it forces you to time your stroke to your body rotation without the assistance of the recovering arm. The transition to full-stroke swimming is important as you will feel an immediate benefit to your stroke’s timing. We suggest you swim sets of Unco as 100 m continuously: 25 m left arm Unco (breathing to the right) 25 m freestyle (only breathing to the right) 25 m right arm Unco (breathing to the left) 25 m freestyle (only breathing to the left) As you transition into the freestyle portions you should

of symmetry and problematic hand entries. e.g. in (1) the thumb-first could potentially cause an injury. Do not shoot from this angle alone as it does not show many stroke flaws. The Overhead View (2, 3, 4) is perhaps the most confronting view you can see of your stroke as it immediately highlights one of the most common flaws – a mid-line crossover that leads to a scissor kicking of the legs (2), causing significant drag. This angle also examines how your breathing pattern (unilateral or bilateral) affects your stroke’s symmetry. If you are either a Bambino (4) or an Overglider (3) you will be able to see how your stroke timing is affecting your stroke. Overgliders can spot a near catch-up in their stroke and Bambinos will notice their lead hand collapsing down so that they lack any support in front of the head while breathing. --- Page 137 Text --- The Perfect Side View (5, 6, 7) is your first glimpse of how your body position may be holding you back in the water and what might be causing this. From above the water it is easy to misinterpret how high your legs sit but from this angle under the water we can easily see how much ‘sinky’ legs might be holding you back (5). This is also a great angle to see how pressing down at the front of the stroke is one of the primary causes of ‘Sinky Leg Syndrome’. --- Page 138 Text --- For Overgliders, this is a very powerful image to demonstrate how your catch-up style (6) can lead you to overglide and apply the brakes at the front of your stroke (7). Given that many true Overgliders are intentionally targeting a slow stroke rate, you can see here how applying the brakes

looked so graceful in the process. Swimmers would be taught to do endless technique sets in the pool trying to reduce the number of strokes taken per length with those producing the lowest numbers being praised and those over the average being rejected as failing to be efficient, despite how fast they might have been swimming in races. ON SHELLEY TAYLOR-SMITH COACH GRAEME CARROLL: Shelley’s body shape and swimming technique was forged to be ‘the perfect open water swimmer’. I likened her to a Ferrari: built to do the distance at speed. Shelley was able to keep a steady rate of 40–45 [80–90 SPM] in all types of conditions, rough and smooth waters, and varying temperatures. What sums it up best is Shelley coming to me one day in her late 30s when she was still ranked world number one woman, wanting to change her body (in particular her big shoulders) to be more feminine. I replied ‘that body is the body of a World Champion and you can mess with it anyway you want when you retire but right now nothing is broken, so we’re not changing a thing!’ Steven Munatones, Founder www.openwaterswimming.com and former USA Open Water Swimming Team Coach: ‘Shelley Taylor-Smith’s legacy – in which she beat her male competitors so consistently – led to the international governing body to create equal prize money for both men and women in the sport. Shelley’s greatest achievement will live on throughout the waterways of the world.’ Most coaches and theoreticians seemed to be looking past those swimmers excelling in events longer than 400 m in the pool and open water when they wrote their manuals on how all of us should aim to swim.

back is their low body position in the water, which is caused by a combination of stroke flaws which each need to be tackled in turn: A strong tendency to hold onto their breath underwater which harms relaxation and creates excess buoyancy in the chest, lifting the front end up and pushing the legs downward. Since Arnies tend to have significant lean muscle mass they are always quite ‘sinky’ in the water and so are more vulnerable to this effect than any other type. Working on a relaxed smooth exhalation into the water is key to improving their body position. Of all the Swim Types, the Arnie is the most susceptible to crossing over in front of the head. Kicking from the knee rather than the hip is a key Arnie trait. This adds significant drag, lowering the legs in the water and burns large amounts of oxygen from overly utilising the large quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups. Arnies swim flat in the water and miss out on using their body rotation to lengthen the stroke and help drive it. This style of swimming overuses the shoulder muscles, which partly explains why many Arnies have poor swimming endurance. --- Page 155 Text --- Another classic Arnie trait is a large scissor kick, which drags the legs down low in the water. The lack of body rotation causes the arms to swing around the side of the Arnie with the momentum carrying the hand across the centre line in front of the head. Arnies often have stiff upper backs and shoulders, which, combined with this low swinging arm recovery, can exacerbate crossovers further. Whilst it’s possible for any swimmer to have a scissor kick, the Arnie is the most susceptible because of their tendency to cross over in front of the

the head. Arnies often have stiff upper backs and shoulders, which, combined with this low swinging arm recovery, can exacerbate crossovers further. Whilst it’s possible for any swimmer to have a scissor kick, the Arnie is the most susceptible because of their tendency to cross over in front of the head. This causes a swimmer to lose their balance slightly and give an involuntary (and often subconscious) scissor kick to regain their balance. Scissor kicks add a large amount of drag and act to sink the legs, worsening the drag profile still further. Most Arnies feel a desperate need to get air whilst they swim resulting in a distinct lifting of the head to clear the surface rather than using the bow wave to breathe. This lifting of the head causes the legs to sink downward adding significant drag. Poor ankle flexibility is often a hindrance to Arnies as they have an inability to point their foot straight, leaving the top of the foot out in the water flow. This pulls the legs downward and creates a lot of drag. A little-but-often approach to developing some ankle flexibility will really pay dividends for their swimming. Arnies have a poor catch technique with a dominant push down on the water at the front of the stroke. This only acts to lift the front end upwards and sink the legs without adding any forward propulsion. A straight arm pull-through under the water is common, which over works the shoulder muscle groups. Whilst not strictly stroke technique, Arnies are also the worst culprits when it comes to poor pacing with a real tendency to start a swim or training set too fast and then blow up and slow down dramatically. Developing a good sense of pace awareness and control is a critical skill

just bring it under control. Kicktastics have a strong tendency to pull through underwater with a straight arm. A very strong energy-sapping leg kick. Slower Kicktastics may kick excessively from the knee, which produces less propulsion and more drag. Poor catch and ‘feel for the water’, normally pushing down on the water at the front of the stroke with a straight arm rather than bending the elbow and pressing the water backwards. Crossovers in front of the head are common with Kicktastics, further harming their ‘feel for the water’. Unlike the other classic offender of a crossover (the Arnie), Kicktastics don’t typically display a scissor kick due to the rapid continuous movement of the legs smothering this effect. Many Kicktastics pull through with a very straight arm under the body, over-working the weaker shoulder muscles, which are not powerful enough to generate much propulsion. A good stroke technique involves bending the elbow so that the larger muscles of the back, chest and core are engaged with the movement. Poor body rotation, resulting in the arm recovering round the side of the body rather than over the top. For classic Kicktastics with restricted upper backs this can be very tight and awkward. For the full Kicktastic stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 164 Text --- CHAPTER 21 The Overglider --- Page 165 Text --- Overgliders are normally swimmers who learned freestyle as adults, they tend to be thoughtful individuals who have studied swimming carefully in books or on the internet. In nearly every case they have latched on to the idea that, to be an efficient swimmer, the freestyle stroke should be long with minimum strokes taken per length. Above the water they can look smooth and relaxed but under the water we see why they are not as

to race well in longer distance open water events or triathlon, so even though they are capable of swimming with the Smooth style they choose to adopt the Swinger route to be more efficient in this environment. Very often such swimmers are able to switch between the two stroke styles at will. --- Page 174 Text --- Be wary of drawing the conclusion that those with long arms suit a Smooth stroke style and those with shorter arms the Swinger style. Whilst the latter may be true, the former isn’t. There are many swimmers with long arms who swim naturally — and extremely quickly — with a Swinger style, Laure Manadou and Shelley Taylor-Smith being prime examples. Unrefined Swinger — Classic Stroke Flaws Swingers are accomplished swimmers and for this reason their strokes don’t need a major overhaul. Instead, they are likely to need a tune-up in a few areas, removing any crossovers, tuning up their catch technique and possibly formalising a 2-beat kick. A common flaw in unrefined Swingers is a crossover in front of the head on hand entry or crossing over the centre line under the body. Over the years this may have gradually crept in as flexibility and posture has worsened since their days as a junior swimmer. A thumb-first entry into the water is another common flaw seen. In some cases this feels like a natural way of entering to the swimmer while in other cases they were coached to enter thumb first as junior swimmers. In either case this needs to be rectified because of the high risk of shoulder injury from a thumb-first entry — in fact many Swingers already suffer from shoulder pain for this reason. A hurried catch phase results from a Swinger’s desire to get on and swim at a

swimmers. In either case this needs to be rectified because of the high risk of shoulder injury from a thumb-first entry — in fact many Swingers already suffer from shoulder pain for this reason. A hurried catch phase results from a Swinger’s desire to get on and swim at a high tempo. Taking a little longer over the catch will allow the swimmer to get into a better high-elbow catch position and gain a better purchase on the water. Many Swingers have become a little too flat in the water over the years and need to stretch out just a little more in their strokes. The right balance always needs to be struck between stroke length and stroke rate — whilst a Swinger definitely sits towards the shorter faster end of this spectrum it’s possible to take this a little too far and ‘over-rev’. In these cases adding a touch more stroke length is recommended. Sam shows us three common Swinger flaws in one photo: holding breath, thumb-first entry and crossing the centre line underwater. Despite their experience as swimmers, Swingers can be some of the worst culprits when it comes to holding their breath under water. By improving their exhalation technique Swingers should be able to breathe bilaterally quite easily; in fact with their fast stroke rate breathing every five strokes may be an option. For the full Swinger stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 175 Text --- CHAPTER 23 The Smooth --- Page 176 Text --- The Smooth Swim Type is what everybody thinks of when they imagine a long efficient stroke style.

Don’t be intimidated by the distances he swam, or the paces he sustained, instead notice the components of training, technique and open water skills in the week and how he simply looked to repeat this week time and time again to prepare perfectly for the swim. Table 26.4 Paul Newsome’s English Channel skeleton training structure. A balanced programme appropriate to your race distance and the training time available will make all the difference to your success in the water. Day Session Detail Monday Very easy 2—3 km swim including a range of drills to ensure good injury management OR Rest Day Tuesday Moderate 6—7 km pool swim including drills and a solid 4—6 km main set of 10 to 15 × 400 m at 1’24′ per 100 m pace with 21 seconds rest between each 400 m (guided by my Wetronome). WednesdayTough 9 km pool set swam on a 43 to 45 second per 50 m cycle, e.g. 20 × 50 m, 10 × 100 m, 5 × 200 m, 2 × 500 m, 1 × 1000 m, 2 × 500 m, 5 × 200 m, 10 × 100 m, 20 × 50 m. The cycle time includes any rest, so the faster you swim the more rest you get. I would typically average 1′18″ per 100 m for these sets. Thursday Moderate 10 km cold (15°C/59°F) open water swim at an average pace of ∼1′24″ per 100 m including drink stops every 2 km for 15—20 seconds.

Text --- When it comes to swimming, a big limiting factor for many triathletes is a lack of flexibility. Poor flexibility can give rise to many stroke technique flaws including crossovers, dropped elbows and sinking legs, all of which will severely limit your potential in the water. Swim, bike and run training keeps us very busy but improving your flexibility doesn’t have to eat into your training time, you can make some big improvements by performing a stretching routine in front of the TV in the evening. In particular, triathletes and swimmers needs to focus on the following areas when stretching: Upper back / shoulders. Hips. Ankles. Studies show that to avoid injury athletes should either stretch regularly or not at all [1] — it tends to be those athletes who stretch every now and again that experience issues with muscle injury and strains. For this reason you should keep stretching regularly to avoid injury and always warm up properly beforehand. Think of your muscles and tendons as a little like toffee — when cold they are brittle and subject to micro-tears if over-stretched, with some gentle mobilisation and warming up they become a lot more pliable. Stretching prior to a training session should only be used to gently loosen off and not to develop muscle length or range of motion. Such work is best left until after training or in a specific stretching session where you warm up beforehand. Stretches should never be painful and should never use a bouncing action. Aim to hold each stretch for approximately 20 seconds and repeat each two to three times. Practise deep controlled breathing while stretching. Stretching: Upper Back and Shoulders Doorway Chest Stretch. Standing in a doorway or beside a post, place your arm in the position shown with your elbow

bouncing action. Aim to hold each stretch for approximately 20 seconds and repeat each two to three times. Practise deep controlled breathing while stretching. Stretching: Upper Back and Shoulders Doorway Chest Stretch. Standing in a doorway or beside a post, place your arm in the position shown with your elbow at a right angle. Gently press forwards with your chest and feel the stretch across the front of your shoulder and through the pectoral (chest) muscle. Avoid pushing the shoulder itself too far forward — instead think of drawing your shoulder blades together and back. --- Page 211 Text --- Telescope Arms and Rotation Stretch. This looks complicated but is easy when you get the hang of it! Start by lying on your side with knees bent to approximately 90° and one hand on top of the other. Take a deep breath in and as you exhale rotate the top arm all the way over to open yourself out into a crucifix position whilst following the arm with your gaze. Take a few deep breaths in this position and feel your back and shoulders sinking into the ground with every exhale. This fantastic stretch develops your chest, shoulder and back mobility all in one. Take care to perform it in a slow controlled manner and do not attempt it if you have had any major back problems in the past. --- Page 212 Text --- Triceps and Lats Stretch.

into a wall or against a post. Relax into the position and feel the stretch through your triceps and lat muscles. Forward Lean Shoulder Stretch. Whilst kneeling, lean forwards with your hands extended out in front of each shoulder. Feel the stretch through the shoulders and chest and underneath the armpits. Hip Flexor Stretch. A lot of time spent sitting at a desk and training on the bike can result in the hip flexor muscles at the front of the hip becoming short. When trying to maintain a horizontal position in the water to reduce drag, this tightness in the hips can pull your legs forward and lower in the water. Regular stretching of the hip flexors will help improve your body position in the water. Settle into the position shown with your lead leg angled 90 degrees at the knee and your rear leg stretched out behind you. Keeping your body vertical and strong, gently push your hips forward and gently squeeze your glutes (your buttock muscles). You will feel the stretch through the front of the hip and possibly into the quadriceps. As a triathlete, think of this as one of your key stretches. --- Page 213 Text --- Seated Ankle Stretch. In the Swim Smooth squads in Perth, we perform very few kick sets with our triathletes, preferring instead to perform drills using a pair of longer flexible flippers, which help to stretch off your ankles. This is a very good use of your time as you develop your stroke using a specific drill and stretch your ankles simultaneously. Outside of the pool you can also use the two stretches shown to assist in stretching off your ankles. Left: Sit on the floor with one leg extended in front and the other bent across the top. Hold

little and often is best. Calf stretch (right). Crouch down with foot kept flat on the floor and the other pointing back underneath you. Keep your body weight over the foot which is flat on the ground and feel the stretch through the lower calf muscle (soleus). 2. Core Stability and Rehabilitation In Chapter 10 we looked at how you could improve your use of your upper core (shoulders / upper back) and lower core (lower back / abdominal) muscle groups to improve your posture whilst swimming. Here are a few key exercises that you can use at home or in the gym to improve your general conditioning in these areas. Given that core stabilisation training initially requires some skill in order for you to feel the correct muscles activating, we would highly recommend seeking the assistance of a personal trainer or physiotherapist to take you through these exercises. Core stability became very popular in the mid to late 1990s together with an increasing interest in pilates, yoga and the combined ‘yogilates’. Core stability is the interaction of coordination and strength of the abdominal, back and glute muscles during activity to ensure that the spine is stabilised and provides a firm base to support both basic and powerful everyday movements of the arms and legs. Core stability training is an essential component of sport performance and plays a key role in injury prevention. The core muscles are the deepest layer of muscles within the torso and include the abdominals, lower back, buttock and hip muscles, which surround --- Page 215 Text --- the pelvis. Developing a solid foundation within your torso will then allow you to generate powerful movements from your trunk outwards. In a nutshell, core stability: Improves posture. Maintains healthy and balanced muscles. Enhances physical functioning in everyday

back, buttock and hip muscles, which surround --- Page 215 Text --- the pelvis. Developing a solid foundation within your torso will then allow you to generate powerful movements from your trunk outwards. In a nutshell, core stability: Improves posture. Maintains healthy and balanced muscles. Enhances physical functioning in everyday activities (‘Functional Fitness’). Facilitates powerful movements such as those executed during sport. Helps to protect joints and muscles from injury. Neutral Spine The idea of a neutral spine relates to setting your trunk before you begin a core stability programme. By finding your neutral spine position you are activating the key core muscles within your torso, which need to be ‘turned on’ prior to executing coordinated movements. Here’s how: 1. Start by lying flat on your back on a mat or comfortable carpeted floor with your knees bent. 2. Place your arms by your sides so that your elbows are straight and your shoulders relaxed. 3. Slowly take three deep breaths in and out to try and release any stress and relax your body. 4. Gently and slowly tilt your pelvis so that you are flattening your back into the floor. Avoid lifting your buttocks. Try to isolate the movement so that only your pelvis is moving. 5. Now tilt your pelvis in the opposite direction so that you are arching your lower back. Again try to keep the movement isolated to your pelvis. 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 a few more times. By tilting your pelvis you are performing what is called an anterior pelvic tilt (arch back) and a posterior pelvic tilt (flatten back). 7. Now to locate your neutral spine, find the middle position between flattening and arching your back. Here are four simple exercises that you can use to improve your core conditioning: Controlled Roll

performing what is called an anterior pelvic tilt (arch back) and a posterior pelvic tilt (flatten back). 7. Now to locate your neutral spine, find the middle position between flattening and arching your back. Here are four simple exercises that you can use to improve your core conditioning: Controlled Roll Ups Lie flat on your back on the floor, legs straight out in front of you placing your arms and hands by your sides. Gently and slowly lift your head off the floor and draw your lower stomach to spine as you slowly start to sit up. Slowly breathe in as you continue sitting up until you are straight, then pause. Begin rolling back down whilst breathing out. Start at your pelvis and slowly unfold your spine as you return to the starting position. Repeat 10—15 times. --- Page 216 Text --- Bridging Lie flat on your back, find your neutral spine and draw your lower stomach in. Slowly push down through your feet and lift your bottom right up so that your trunk is straight with your shoulders, hips and knees in a line. Breathe in as you lift and out as you lower, and hold the lift for 5—10 seconds thinking of squeezing your buttocks as you lift. Repeat 10—15 times. Wall Squats Standing with your back to the wall take one step away with both feet whilst keeping your back to the wall. Your toes should be in line and slightly turned out. Find your neutral spine position and draw your lower stomach in. Holding this position, slowly perform a half squat keeping your bottom against the wall. Hold the squat for five seconds and then lift to return to the start. Complete three sets of twelve squats. --- Page 217 Text --- Front Plank Place your

position and draw your lower stomach in. Holding this position, slowly perform a half squat keeping your bottom against the wall. Hold the squat for five seconds and then lift to return to the start. Complete three sets of twelve squats. --- Page 217 Text --- Front Plank Place your elbows on the floor shoulder width apart and directly under your shoulders. Supporting yourself on your elbows and toes, be sure your body is in a flat line with no dip or arch in your spine and with your bottom tucked in. Keep your spine neutral and draw in your lower stomach. Hold this position for 20—30 seconds and then rest for 30 seconds, repeating three times. As you get stronger challenge yourself by trying to hold the position for longer each time. The Y-T-W-L Here’s a dry-land exercise we have borrowed from physiotherapists to help you tune into drawing your shoulders together and back (technical term ‘scapular retraction’). We are sure you are familiar with the Village People’s hit song from the 1970s: ‘YMCA’. We are going to do the Y-T-W-L instead! --- Page 218 Text --- Standing in some space, draw your arms up into a Y position beside you. How do they naturally sit? Do they tend to lean forwards like Paul’s position on the left? Maintaining this position, focus on drawing your shoulder blades together and back and notice how your arms come back in line with the body. That’s good posture in action! Avoid arching your lower back as you do this. Run through each of the Y-T-W-L positions, holding each position for around ten seconds; the exercise gets progressively harder to stabilise through the four positions!

your lower back as you do this. Run through each of the Y-T-W-L positions, holding each position for around ten seconds; the exercise gets progressively harder to stabilise through the four positions! The YTWL is a great exercise to add into any stretching and conditioning routine that you have in place. You can practise it immediately before a swim or even between sets in the shallow end of the pool. Over time the YTWL will give you a greater awareness of your posture and help you improve it. In Chapter 30 we will look at some more functional rehab-style exercises for the upper back and shoulders that will help to ward off shoulder injury. --- Page 219 Text --- 3. Strength Training in the Gym When considering introducing traditional gym strengthening exercises into your swimming programme we would encourage you to always ask the question ‘how specific is this exercise to my swimming?’. Swimming is not ordinarily limited by strength in the true sense of the word, which is probably best demonstrated by the example of the 11-year-old girl who so easily cruises past you in the pool and yet would never come close to matching your strength in the gym as an adult. Despite swimming not being limited by strength, some swimmers and triathletes like to add a gym strengthening programme to their routine during the winter months and we would not discourage you from doing so if you are seeking a little general conditioning and toning. We would, however, encourage you to avoid too much emphasis on lifting heavy weights, especially those focused on the muscles at the front of the shoulder and chest (e.g. shoulder and bench press). If performed excessively these exercises can limit mobility in the shoulders and also bring you into a rounded-shoulder posture

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
however, encourage you to avoid too much emphasis on lifting heavy weights, especially those focused on the muscles at the front of the shoulder and chest (e.g. shoulder and bench press). If performed excessively these exercises can limit mobility in the shoulders and also bring you into a rounded-shoulder posture that could harm your alignment in the pool. In fact, most swimmers and triathletes that we see who have a background in weight training are limited by those two factors: posture and mobility. If you are going to use the gym we suggest you focus your attention on the following exercises that will help maintain and improve your swimming posture: Barbell Row. This exercise focuses on the shoulder and scapular region muscle groups. Use a light weight for this exercise and keep the shoulder horizontal, aiming for 2—3 sets of 12—15 reps with each arm. Lat Pull Down. A great exercise for assisting with good posture and alignment of the upper back. Keep your spine straight when performing this exercise and keep the weight light. Aim for 2-3 sets of 15—20 reps. --- Page 220 Text --- Seated Upright Row. Another excellent exercise for helping you to focus on drawing your shoulder blades together and down when you swim. Keep the spine straight and again use a light weight. Aim for 2—3 sets of 15—20 reps. Travelling Away from Home?

Epub 2006 May 6. --- Page 222 Text --- CHAPTER 30 Prevention and Management of Shoulder Injuries Shoulder pain and injury is very common amongst freestyle swimmers and is caused by repetitive stress placed on the shoulders during each arm stroke. At least 80% of adult swimmers will experience some form of shoulder pain in their swimming lives and such pain should be taken very seriously so that it does not lead to a full-blown injury and time out from swimming. Most elite swimmers train for around 40-70 km per week, which adds up to well over two million strokes per year — that is an awful lot of potential stress on their shoulders. In fact, in elite swimming circles shoulder injury was so common that it used to be considered a fact of swimming life, just something they had to live with. Fortunately these days we understand that the stress on the shoulders is dramatically affected by stroke technique and that by correcting your technique we can greatly reduce stress on the joint, quickly reduce symptoms and go on to cure the condition.

we understand that the stress on the shoulders is dramatically affected by stroke technique and that by correcting your technique we can greatly reduce stress on the joint, quickly reduce symptoms and go on to cure the condition. An absolutely vital aspect of your preparation as a swimmer is consistency in your training; if you need time out of the water to recover from an injury you will lose the fitness gains that you would otherwise have achieved. For this reason if you suffer from any form of pain in your shoulders you need to take immediate corrective action using the advice in this chapter. Avoid shoulder injury at all costs, it will ruin the consistency of your training, which is absolutely key to your success as a swimmer. --- Page 223 Text --- Shoulder Injury Signs and Symptoms Shoulder injury may begin as mild pain in the shoulder, which is only felt when swimming but can quickly progress to moderate or severe pain felt while performing daily activities and while sleeping. Early on, symptoms will subside shortly after swimming; however, if there has been no period of rest or treatment, pain may come on sooner and persist with other activities involving shoulder movements. Common symptoms of swimming shoulder injury include pain, limited movement, a painful arc, muscle weakness, tenderness to touch, clicking noises or catching sensations. PAUL: I vividly recall a conversation I had with my long-term coach Chris Jones (former British Triathlon Head Coach) about one of the other junior athletes on the British Triathlon team with me at the time, Tim Don. Tim had just won the World Junior Triathlon Championships in 1998 and Chris had asked Tim about the factors involved in his success and his rise to prominence.

other junior athletes on the British Triathlon team with me at the time, Tim Don. Tim had just won the World Junior Triathlon Championships in 1998 and Chris had asked Tim about the factors involved in his success and his rise to prominence. Perhaps the key point that Tim highlighted was his consistency of training — he hadn’t picked up a single injury in the past three seasons. This, combined with an excellent and balanced training programme, had allowed him to lift his game and dominate the world junior triathlon scene — something I could only ever dream of! Thinking back to my own training in that period, my incidence of injury was quite high and my progress was constantly being stalled by time out from training. If there’s one thing guaranteed to help you improve, it’s consistent practice of correct training methods. Likewise, if there’s one thing guaranteed to throw a spanner in the works, it’s an injury! Please be super-proactive with your stroke technique to avoid injury, use pre- swimming exercises to loosen off before swimming and take a sensible approach to your overall training load. Don’t panic if you already have a shoulder injury, use the advice in this chapter to get it quickly under control. Pain can be felt in the top, front, side or back of the shoulder and may even radiate down the arm to the elbow. Swelling and torn tissue may also be present, however it is most likely this will only be seen by ultrasound examination.

seen by ultrasound examination. Take Immediate Action --- Page 224 Text --- As soon as you experience any shoulder pain or injury always seek medical advice from a physiotherapist, athletic therapist or sports doctor as soon as possible in order to determine the severity of the injury and to begin rehabilitation. Also immediately reduce or stop training to prevent the pain and swelling from continuing. Resting from activities or movements which aggravate pain is critical and applying ice to reduce inflammation is also key to a successful and fast recovery. Secondly, make sure that you address areas of your stroke technique that can be causing or aggravating the injury using the advice that follows in this chapter. Whilst rehabilitation is important, without addressing your stroke technique an injury could quickly return. Finally, as part of your rehabilitation, introduce the strengthening and stability exercises into your training programme so as to maintain muscle balance around your shoulder joint, which will help to maintain healthy strong shoulders and upper back. Before training always warm-up and stretch lightly but do not over-stretch your shoulders as too much flexibility can also be detrimental. What is the Cause of Shoulder Pain? Shoulder pain is commonly classified into three categories: 1. Shoulder Joint Impingement Shoulder Impingement is a compression or squashing of the structures within the top of the shoulder joint (subacromial space). Within this space lie muscular tendons (e.g. the rotator cuff), and the fluid filled sac that prevents muscle on bone traction (the subacromial bursa). Impingement arises due to the thickening or swelling of the structures within the space or upward migration of the ball in the shoulder joint, caused by having poor posture or poor biomechanics while swimming. 2. Overuse Injury Overuse injuries are generally defined as tendonopathies, which is where there is

bursa). Impingement arises due to the thickening or swelling of the structures within the space or upward migration of the ball in the shoulder joint, caused by having poor posture or poor biomechanics while swimming. 2. Overuse Injury Overuse injuries are generally defined as tendonopathies, which is where there is injury to or degeneration of the tendon of a muscle, which may or may not be accompanied by inflammation. Damage to a tendon tissue occurs when the load applied exceeds the strength of the tendon either over time or in a single incident. Tendon injuries can be very difficult to treat because tendons have a poor blood supply and totally resting a tendon to allow it to heal is hard to achieve in daily life. FIGURE 30.19 The shoulder joint showing all the structures of the rotator cuff which may become thickened or swollen from poor posture and biomechanics when swimming which can lead to impingement. (Source: Principles of Anatomy and Physiology 13th edition, Gerard J. Tortora, p. 311). --- Page 225 Text --- 3. Joint Laxity/Instability Joint laxity or instability normally develops over an extended period of time if there is no traumatic injury to the shoulder joint. Gradual deterioration in the ligaments and inhibition of the rotator cuff muscles leads to laxity or loosening of the shoulder joint. If this is not addressed instability of the shoulder can occur which may lead to a tear in the lining of the socket of the shoulder joint (a capsular lesion). Elements of each of these three patterns can coexist and are often interrelated. For example, a swimmer who has been diagnosed with a rotator cuff injury will experience pain, which prevents the muscles from working properly thereby allowing the ball (head of the humerus) to move more in the socket.

Elements of each of these three patterns can coexist and are often interrelated. For example, a swimmer who has been diagnosed with a rotator cuff injury will experience pain, which prevents the muscles from working properly thereby allowing the ball (head of the humerus) to move more in the socket. Overall, the shoulder joint moves more than normal which can lead to laxity or instability of the shoulder. This laxity allows the ball to migrate upwards in the socket (glenoid fossa), which causes impingement or compression of the structures in the top of the shoulder. Many factors can cause shoulder injury. Broadly speaking these can be split into two key areas, both of which you should address to help prevent and rehabilitate sore shoulders: 1. Poor stroke technique and sudden increases in volume and/or intensity within your programme. 2. Poor posture and mobility in your neck and upper back as well as muscle imbalance around your shoulders. In the rest of this chapter we will look at each of these areas and how to address them to fix a shoulder problem. Shoulder Injury: Stroke Technique and Training The classic stroke technique flaws that cause shoulder injury are as follows, refer to Figure 30.20 to view pictures of them and how to correct them: --- OCR from Page 225 Image 1 --- plane Acromioclavicular ligament Clavicle Acromion of scapula + SMe Rotator cuff muscle SUBACROMIAL BURSA (supraspinatus) Head of humerus Tendon of biceps —— brachii muscle (long head) Humerus (ec) Frontal section --- Page 226 Text --- FIGURE 30.20 Common stroke technique flaws causing injury. --- OCR from Page 227 Image 2 --- He nil it | vt --- Page 228 Text --- A Thumb-First Entry into the Water To enter into the water thumb first (1) the swimmer must internally

section --- Page 226 Text --- FIGURE 30.20 Common stroke technique flaws causing injury. --- OCR from Page 227 Image 2 --- He nil it | vt --- Page 228 Text --- A Thumb-First Entry into the Water To enter into the water thumb first (1) the swimmer must internally rotate the shoulder, which reduces the subacromial space and places the rotator cuff muscles in a high-risk position. Ironically enough this hand entry had been taught for many years as a way of improving how smoothly the hand entered into the water. Whilst you might get away with this if you are 11 years old with good flexibility and rotation in your stroke, as adults we need to be much more careful and modify our strokes to use a fingertips-first entry as demonstrated by Miss Smooth (2). This will keep your shoulder in a much more neutral position. A Crossover Upon Hand Entry Evident in over 70% of the swimmers we work with, a midline crossover (3) has a similar effect to that of a thumb-first entry (squashing the front of the shoulder). If a crossover is combined with a thumb-first entry this will almost certainly lead to a shoulder injury. To straighten your hand entry, visualise the middle finger of each hand extending straight forward in front of the same shoulder, not across, as demonstrated by Miss Smooth (4). Poor Body Rotation Many swimmers who were taught to swim by the Red Cross in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were taught that body rotation along the long axis of the spine was a bad thing and a waste of effort (5). Conversely in the 1990s there was a strong and concerted effort to encourage swimmers to rotate to a full 90° by ‘stacking their shoulders’. Neither method is correct

were taught that body rotation along the long axis of the spine was a bad thing and a waste of effort (5). Conversely in the 1990s there was a strong and concerted effort to encourage swimmers to rotate to a full 90° by ‘stacking their shoulders’. Neither method is correct but both still persist in some swimming programmes today. To avoid shoulder injury, good body rotation between 45° and 60° is essential on every stroke (not just when you are breathing) and aids the recovery phase of the freestyle stroke by allowing the arm to clear the surface of the water without excessive internal rotation of the shoulder. This is best demonstrated by the land-based exercises as listed in Chapter 11. To avoid shoulder injury and improve your stroke efficiency, aim for rotation along the central axis of the spine demonstrated by Miss Smooth (6). A Straight Arm Catch and Pull-Through A straight arm pull-through is another very common stroke flaw and is a precursor to shoulder injury in many cases. When the arm pulls through with a straight elbow (7) it --- Page 229 Text --- creates a large amount of force on the unstable and relatively weak shoulder and rotator cuff muscles. This is exacerbated if the swimmer trains with large hand paddles as they put further force through the shoulder when in a very compromised position. Large hand paddles have a bad reputation for causing injury for this reason, but it is not directly the fault of the paddle, it is poor technique combined with a large paddle that creates shoulder injury. In fact when used in moderation with a bent elbow pull (8), hand paddles carry a very low injury risk. An Excessive Flick at the Exit (Push) Phase Some coaches and swim programmes encourage their

the paddle, it is poor technique combined with a large paddle that creates shoulder injury. In fact when used in moderation with a bent elbow pull (8), hand paddles carry a very low injury risk. An Excessive Flick at the Exit (Push) Phase Some coaches and swim programmes encourage their swimmers to ‘finish strong’ at the back of the stroke by emphasising the push immediately prior to the hand exiting the water at the rear of the stroke. This causes the swimmer to hyper-extend the elbow (9) and excessively internally rotate the shoulder. As well as stressing the shoulder joint, the hyper-extension at the elbow can cause a condition called medial epicondylitis (‘Golfer’s Elbow’). Swimmers who overly lengthen their freestyle strokes are particularly susceptible to this condition. Instead of locking out straight, the arm should exit the water with a slight bend of around 150° at the elbow. The palm of the hand should be turned in slightly towards the thigh to complete the stroke smoothly (10). A Sudden Increase in Training Volume or Intensity It is very important that you do not suddenly increase the volume of your training by more than 5% to 10% per week. Sudden jumps in volume or training intensity can trigger shoulder injury, especially if any of the above stroke flaws are in place in your stroke. This should not put you off fitness training as part of a balanced programme but take care to build things up progressively, especially if you are suddenly inspired (as we hope you will be!) with the large variety of training sets in Appendix C. Other aspects to watch out for are adding too much pull buoy, paddles and bands work to your swimming sessions, especially if you have poor catch mechanics and limited body rotation in your

inspired (as we hope you will be!) with the large variety of training sets in Appendix C. Other aspects to watch out for are adding too much pull buoy, paddles and bands work to your swimming sessions, especially if you have poor catch mechanics and limited body rotation in your stroke. Shoulder Injury: Posture, Mobility and Muscular Imbalance In freestyle swimmers, there are particular muscle groups which tend to be strong and tight (internal rotators — pectorals and latissimus dorsi) and ones which are weak and lengthened (external rotators and middle and lower trapezius muscles). These imbalances lead to altered biomechanics and so a predisposition to injury. An essential path to reducing the abnormal imbalances in your shoulders is to include a cross --- Page 230 Text --- training programme in your exercise regime. Strengthening the less dominant muscles used in swimming and maintaining good flexibility in your shoulder and thoracic spine will greatly reduce the likelihood of shoulder pain and injury. Follow the six specific exercises below to reduce the stress on your shoulders. Maintaining Thoracic Spine Flexibility A slumped posture is becoming more and more prevalent in the average population as so many of us now have desk jobs and spend large parts of our day sitting at computers. With our shoulders slumped forward and our chins poking out, our upper back and thoracic spine begin to morph into a hump back, which in physio terms is referred to as a kyphosis. In swimmers, a mild kyphosis is common due to the nature of the freestyle stroke and the overuse of the muscles at the front of our shoulders pulling us into a rounded shoulder position. This kyphosis can lead to a loss of flexibility in the thoracic spine which in turn can result in excessive flexibility in

common due to the nature of the freestyle stroke and the overuse of the muscles at the front of our shoulders pulling us into a rounded shoulder position. This kyphosis can lead to a loss of flexibility in the thoracic spine which in turn can result in excessive flexibility in our shoulder joints. Thoracic extension and rotation are two exercises which will maintain a flexible thoracic spine and so keep the shoulders free from excessive load. Poor posture at your desk can be problematic for your swimming and the health of your shoulders. Left: Posture is poor due to a slouched position with the chin poked forwards. Middle: Posture is good with a straight, tall back, feet flat on the floor and shoulders back. Right: Good posture is being over-exaggerated which places too much load on the lower back. 1. Thoracic Extension Using a Towel Roll Referring to FIGURE 30.21 place a rolled hand towel on a carpeted floor (1) and lie on your back with the towel under you so that it sits along your spine between your shoulder blades (2). Let your head fall back onto the floor above the towel (if this is --- Page 231 Text --- uncomfortable for your neck you may use a low pillow to support your head). Straighten your legs and let your arms rest by your sides with your palms facing up (3). FIGURE 30.21 Thoracic Extension Using A Towel Roll. Hold this position for two to three minutes and as a progression move your arms over your head in a snow angel fashion to increase the stretch and lengthen out the muscles at the front of the shoulders (4). 2. Telescope Arms Referring to Figure 30.22 lie on your side with your knees and hips bent to 90° and your

a progression move your arms over your head in a snow angel fashion to increase the stretch and lengthen out the muscles at the front of the shoulders (4). 2. Telescope Arms Referring to Figure 30.22 lie on your side with your knees and hips bent to 90° and your arms stretched out, one on top of the other at shoulder height. Begin the stretch by reaching your top hand past your bottom hand as though you are reaching toward the wall in front of you. Keeping your elbow straight and rotating from your trunk upwards (avoiding rolling your hips), reach your arm toward the ceiling and back toward the opposite wall as though you are carving an arc in the air. Your goal is to finish the stretch with your upper shoulder on the floor. Repeat four to six times on each side. FIGURE 30.22 Telescope Arms Exercise --- Page 232 Text --- 3. Scapular Setting Scapular setting is important to re-establish a more balanced position of the humeral head (ball) in the glenoid fossa (socket) thus improving your overall shoulder posture. Sitting upright in a comfortable chair, gently pull your chin in and open your chest. As you do so, imagine pulling the lower part of your shoulder blades together without arching your back or throwing your rib cage forwards. Only a 30%-40% effort should be used to perform this exercise and you should not feel any tension in your shoulder blades or neck. Keep breathing normally and aim to hold the position for 1-2 minutes until it becomes comfortable, then aim to hold it for longer periods during the day. FIGURE 30.23 Develop an improved posture using Scapular Setting. Do not overexaggerate the position and arch the lower back (right). --- Page 233 Text --- Repeat this

aim to hold the position for 1-2 minutes until it becomes comfortable, then aim to hold it for longer periods during the day. FIGURE 30.23 Develop an improved posture using Scapular Setting. Do not overexaggerate the position and arch the lower back (right). --- Page 233 Text --- Repeat this exercise frequently throughout the day in sitting and standing positions. As a progression try the same position lying on your front with your arms at your side, this will allow you to train these muscles in a prone posture similar to swimming. 4. Shoulder Shrugs Shoulder shrugs address weakness in the upper trapezius muscle, which is often seen when the shoulder on one side is depressed or sits lower, this is normally the shoulder experiencing shoulder pain. Start by standing with your arm slightly away from your body, elbow straight and your palm facing forward (1). Set your shoulder as in the previous Scapular Setting exercise and hold this position. Gently shrug your shoulder toward your ear, hold for 1- 2 seconds (2) before lowering. Repeat three sets of the exercise, each with 10-12 repetitions. As a progression you can add a light hand weight if control allows (3 and 4). Start with 1 kg and progress to 3 kg. FIGURE 30.24 Shoulder Shrugs with and without weights. --- Page 234 Text --- 5. Seated Row Using Theraband A seated row aims to strengthen the muscles at the back of the shoulder between the shoulder blades, which help to stabilise the scapula and improve overall shoulder position and biomechanics. Use a piece of theraband anchored to a door knob or railing at belly button height, stand or sit holding one end of the band in each hand with it taut and slightly stretched in front of you. Start with your

the scapula and improve overall shoulder position and biomechanics. Use a piece of theraband anchored to a door knob or railing at belly button height, stand or sit holding one end of the band in each hand with it taut and slightly stretched in front of you. Start with your elbows straight and shoulders slightly rounded (1 and 3). Leading with your elbows pull your hands toward you bringing them toward the outside of your chest (2). As you pull the band to your chest gently pull your shoulder blades together (4). Repeat three sets of 10-12 repetitions each. As a progression increase repetitions to 15-20 and then increase the resistance by using a stronger theraband. --- Page 235 Text --- FIGURE 30.25 Seated Row Using Theraband. 6. External Shoulder Rotation with Theraband This external shoulder rotation exercise focuses on improving strength in the back of the shoulder primarily in the rotator cuff muscles. This exercise helps to re-balance the rotator cuff muscles and improve the position of the humeral head (ball) in the glenoid fossa (socket). Anchor one end of a piece of theraband to a door knob and stand with your unaffected shoulder beside the door. Hold the end of the theraband on your affected side and stand so that the band is taut with your elbow bent to 90° and your upper arm along your side. Your wrist should be level with the door knob. Set your shoulder as in Exercises 2 and 3 and then gently pull the band away from your mid-line pivoting at your elbow. Repeat three sets of 10-12 repetitions of this exercise.

As a progression increase to 15-20 repetitions then increase the resistance by using a stronger theraband. FIGURE 30.26 External Shoulder Rotation Using Theraband. --- Page 237 Text --- CHAPTER 31 Pool Skills If you are considering joining a triathlon club or Masters swim squad to improve your swimming, the simple tips in this chapter will help you fit in more quickly. Joining a squad does not need to be a confronting experience and you will certainly find many other swimmers at a similar level to yourself all keen to improve their swimming. This can be very motivating and we would always recommend that swimmers and triathletes aim to do at least one squad session per week under the guidance of a coach. Squad Training and Lane Etiquette Here are our top 10 tips on surviving your first few squad sessions with correct lane etiquette: 1. Unless otherwise advised, use the pool clock to set off exactly five seconds behind the person in front of you. You should not try to catch them up, as whilst this gives you a draft and makes it feel easier, you are not then getting the best possible workout that you could and it can also annoy the person in front. The coach will announce when drafting is actively encouraged but normally keep your distance to allow everyone to perform at their best, especially on technique sets. 2. Always keep close to the lane rope and swim in the circular direction advised on the plaque at the end of the lane, either clockwise or anticlockwise. If there is no sign, observe what others are already doing in the lane and aim to replicate that —

back above your head. 6. Keep the knees, ankles and feet together and aim to plant them firmly on the wall with your toes pointing to either 10 o’clock or 2 o’clock on the wall. Note: you do not have to attempt to add in a full twist at this point so that your feet would be pointing to 6 o’clock. 7. Aim to make contact with the wall with your knees bent at about 90° — much more or less than this and you will struggle to get a good drive off the wall. 8. As you drive off the wall, strive to stretch out in a full torpedo (streamlined) position. Add in a few freestyle flutter kicks or dolphin (butterfly) kicks to emphasise your speed off the wall and rotate fully back onto your front. 9. Maintain the streamlined torpedo and aim to break out into your full stroke at about 5 m (15 feet) from the wall. Dives Some swim squads like to finish a session with some sprints from the deep end of the pool from a dive start — these are great fun and they sharpen up your pool skills. --- Page 240 Text --- Whilst not compulsory, learning to dive properly can be a lot of fun and if you are planning on racing in the pool it will really give you a good advantage especially in the shorter sprint events. IMPORTANT: Always ensure that you check the depth of water that you are diving into and that there are no foreign obstacles or other swimmers that might get in your way and cause you harm. There is a risk of neck and spinal injury from diving into any body of water but if the depth is greater than 1.8 m (6 ft) and

diving into and that there are no foreign obstacles or other swimmers that might get in your way and cause you harm. There is a risk of neck and spinal injury from diving into any body of water but if the depth is greater than 1.8 m (6 ft) and you execute a shallow racing dive into clear water the biggest risk that you face is a painful and embarrassing ‘belly flop’. If learning to dive, always seek the assistance of a qualified instructor and if you feel at all uncomfortable it is advisable to give it a miss and try again another day. Referring to Figure 31.28 here are our key tips to performing a successful racing dive: FIGURE 31.28 The dive start. 1. In a race the starter will call you onto the blocks with a series of short, sharp whistles to quieten the crowd followed by a longer whistle to invite you to step up. 2. You can choose to go from the side of the pool or off the special dive blocks which feature at many competition pools. Being higher and angled slightly down at the front, blocks allow the swimmer to gain a little more height (and with it, --- Page 241 Text --- distance) when they dive, which can make for a cleaner entry into the water. You have three basic stances which you can try in order to ready yourself for a good dive: 1) the classic start — feet together and hands reaching either side of the feet as you fold yourself over at the waist; 2) the competition start — feet about shoulder width apart and hands reaching between the feet, using the lip of the block to pull up against and gain traction on the block and coil the body

reaching either side of the feet as you fold yourself over at the waist; 2) the competition start — feet about shoulder width apart and hands reaching between the feet, using the lip of the block to pull up against and gain traction on the block and coil the body like a tight spring; 3) the track start (shown) — a similar hand position as the classic start, but one foot is placed back in a similar stance to how a track runner might start — this will typically be your strongest leg. Experiment and see which gives you the fastest reaction time and power off the blocks. 3. The starter will start you off with the instruction ‘take your marks. . .’ and then follow with either a whistle, gun blast or a simple ‘go!’ 4. Keep your chin tucked into your chest and spring your arms out in front of you to form a streamlined torpedo whilst driving off the block with the legs aiming for both a little height and a good bit of distance. If you lift your head and look forward too much you will cause your legs to drop too low and you will hit the water stomach and chest first (the ‘belly flop’). Tucking your chin in too tightly and spearing the water at too great an angle will force you into a nose dive and send you too deep into the water. 5. Once in the water, keep your hands together and commence a powerful kick to maintain your speed before breaking out into your full stroke just as per any normal push-off. In our Swim Smooth Perth squad sessions we perform very little of the other three competitive strokes: butterfly, backstroke and breaststroke. Whilst these strokes can benefit your freestyle by

commence a powerful kick to maintain your speed before breaking out into your full stroke just as per any normal push-off. In our Swim Smooth Perth squad sessions we perform very little of the other three competitive strokes: butterfly, backstroke and breaststroke. Whilst these strokes can benefit your freestyle by developing better muscular balance across the body, if you are only swimming two or three times per week and training for a triathlon or open water swimming event, we would advise you to keep your training as specific as possible and focus on mastering the freestyle stroke. However, it is still useful to know some tips on performing the other three strokes and using them in your warm-ups, and particularly cool-downs, as a good way to vary your programme. Butterfly — often seen as the hardest competitive stroke, butterfly can be challenging because it requires excellent rhythm and timing, good flexibility and a strong leg kick. The stroke undulates around the short axis of the spine and in this respect is more similar to breaststroke than freestyle and backstroke. The best way of visualising a good butterfly stroke is to think of yourself moving through the water like a dolphin. Both arms work together above and below the water with a more rounded recovery than in freestyle — probably one of the reasons why many Swingers are good at butterfly! You do need to be cautious, however, as the lack of long axis rotation in butterfly can increase the load on your shoulders so you should limit the volume of butterfly in your programme. Performing butterfly with fins is a great way to develop a feel for the undulated action of the stroke, it can also tone up your midsection and when done gently can help to --- Page 242

on your shoulders so you should limit the volume of butterfly in your programme. Performing butterfly with fins is a great way to develop a feel for the undulated action of the stroke, it can also tone up your midsection and when done gently can help to --- Page 242 Text --- loosen off a tight lower back. The key to a good butterfly stroke is to ensure that as your head comes up out of the water to take a breath, you do this quickly and focus on getting your chin down onto your chest as quickly as you can. This will help the torso dive back down into the water and assist the arms with their recovery over the top of the surface. The key to butterfly is to breathe and then quickly drop your chin back down onto your chest. Backstroke — very similar to freestyle with respect to long axis rotation, backstroke is effectively the reverse of freestyle and is often used as a way of stretching out during a cool-down and working the muscles in the opposite direction. To be good at backstroke having a strong leg kick is essential. If you don’t have a strong kick and want to try some of the beneficial aspects of the stroke then try wearing a pair of fins. Another important feature of backstroke is to keep your head back. We often tell the children who we work with to imagine that they have to keep their noses in the air like a ‘posh’ person would walk around. This stops the common mistake of bringing the chin towards the chest, which causes the swimmer to sit up in the water and drop the legs and buttocks down low. Breaststroke — whilst used by many swimmers who cannot swim

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
a bowl of cake mix with your hands as they pull through to develop this motion! A fast breaststroke uses a snappy arm movement, returning to the front of the stroke as soon as possible. Individual Medley — Swimmers can bring all four competitive strokes together and perform an Individual Medley (‘IM’) which consists of 25 m, 50 m or 100 m of each stroke in succession without stopping in the following order: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle. If performed as part of a medley relay team with three other --- Page 244 Text --- swimmers, the order of the strokes is slightly different: backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, freestyle. For more experienced swimmers, completing a 400 m IM always proves to be a good challenge and is worth swimming every now and then to spice up your training regime. The Most Important Walk in Swimming It might be as little as 10 metres but the walk from the changing rooms to the pool can really define your swimming. If you’ve been learning freestyle or working on improving your stroke then you should feel proud of yourself. Most people in the world cannot swim and many in the Western world do absolutely no exercise at all. You may not be the fastest swimmer in the world but that is absolutely fine thank you — so start walking out onto the pool deck tall and proud. Like your mum used to say: ‘head up, shoulders back, chest forwards!’ A final tip: guys, don’t forget to shave that 5 o’clock shadow before you swim! Adopting some positive body language and being confident in what you are doing will make a real difference when you start swimming. For one thing it will improve the positivity and rhythm in your stroke, which can only be good for

to shave that 5 o’clock shadow before you swim! Adopting some positive body language and being confident in what you are doing will make a real difference when you start swimming. For one thing it will improve the positivity and rhythm in your stroke, which can only be good for your technique. And, if you can carry forward that shoulders-back posture into your stroke you will start to ‘Swim Proud’, which is great for your alignment in the water. --- Page 245 Text --- CHAPTER 32 Nutrition for Longer Sessions and Races At Swim Smooth we are often asked questions about what food and drink swimmers and triathletes should be using when they train and race to keep themselves fuelled and hydrated. Getting this aspect of your training preparation right is very important and will also determine how well you perform in training sessions and how quickly you recover afterwards. Studies have shown the negative effects of dehydration on performance as being anything upwards of 20% and if you have ever depleted your energy strokes and ‘hit the wall’ whilst you have been training you will know the profound effect that this also has. Whilst we believe in a balanced wholefood diet outside of your training and racing, here are a few tips on what you can do immediately before, during and after training to supplement your fuel stores and maintain your hydration levels. We have written our advice on this as a direct response to an email we received recently from one of our swimmers who is contemplating the challenge of the 20 km Rottnest Channel Swim in February 2012: Hi Paul, I have been doing the Saturday morning set the last three weeks with Stu and Clare and feel like I am pretty close to running on empty

Med Sci Sports Exerc. 30:1276–1278. --- Page 267 Text --- CHAPTER 37 Turning Around Buoys PAUL: The annual ‘Swim Thru Perth’ race is a 4 km swim in the Swan River from Barrack Street Jetty to Matilda Bay and is Australia’s longest-running open water swimming event, having been inaugurated in 1919. The musician and artist Rolf Harris famously raced the 4 km in the early 1950s swimming backstroke. At the time Rolf was the Australian junior backstroke champion and a very handy swimmer by all accounts. I have competed in this event most years since I moved to Perth in 2002 and one incident springs to mind when discussing turning around buoys and the general mêlée of swimming in close quarters to other swimmers. The gun had gone off and we were into the first few hundred meters of the swim when I first became aware of a swimmer alongside me who I just couldn’t seem to shake off. We were constantly bumping into each other in a bid to pick the straightest line, neither wishing to concede an inch or wisely choosing to sit back and jump on the other’s toes for a nice draft. The swim course is one long straight-line with a final very sharp right-hand turn with 80 m or so to the finish. By this point we had been duelling it out for just over 48 minutes and clearly whoever made it first around that buoy would beat the other. I felt a hand reach out and grab my shoulder, ducking me several feet under the water. Coming up and gasping for air, another hand perfectly connected with the same shoulder and forced

just over 48 minutes and clearly whoever made it first around that buoy would beat the other. I felt a hand reach out and grab my shoulder, ducking me several feet under the water. Coming up and gasping for air, another hand perfectly connected with the same shoulder and forced me down once again. Fearing more that I would drown at this point, and less that I would win our mini-race, I had no other choice but to jab the assailant in the ribs with my elbow whilst under the water to ensure that I did actually resurface. Sadly the damage was already done and I came off second best across the finish line. Being deliberately dunked in this way is incredibly rare but it highlights that there will be times in open water where your reserve will be tested. Rather than shying away from swimming close to other swimmers, practise getting close to your training buddies and become accustomed to the odd small knock without it putting you off your stroke. Inevitably you will experience a few knocks and bangs whilst swimming in open water – most of which are entirely accidental. They’re never pleasant but become experienced swimming in close proximity to other swimmers and those knocks won’t put you off enjoying this great sport. To turn past a buoy, slide your inner arm past the buoy, flip onto your back and then back onto your front. The thought of the washing machine effect as swimmers converge on a turn buoy in a triathlon or open water swim can be very intimidating to those new to open water swimming. Many worry about getting caught up on the fixing rope or being pushed --- Page 268 Text --- under water by their competitors (a very rare occurrence). These fears

Page 271 Text --- wetsuit in the pool. Either way, it is a very frustrating situation to be in, especially if you have invested quite a bit of money in your wetsuit. Many Kicktastics and Overgliders have developed their swimming with the idea that they should always keep their eyes looking straight down with a very low head position. The belief here is that doing so helps lift the hips and legs higher in the water and so reduces drag. However, for those who already have good natural buoyancy in the water wearing a wetsuit can substantially change their balance. In maintaining the same head position with the wetsuit on, the feet of these swimmers will often pop up out of the water leaving them feeling very unbalanced. Kate also felt like she was not strong enough to use her wetsuit, that her shoulders would fatigue very quickly when using one. She experimented with a short-sleeve suit but whilst her shoulders felt a little looser, she still wasn’t performing as well as she would like in it. Kate benefited from using a straighter arm recovery. To dramatically improve Kate’s swimming performance: 1. We asked her to forget the notion of looking down but aim to look forward in the water by about 1.5 m (5 feet). This brought her legs back down into a usable and more stable position without reintroducing drag. This change also helped her substantially improve her drafting ability by being more aware of other swimmers around her from whom she could gain a tow. 2. We asked her to forget the notion of swimming with a classic high-elbow recovery over the water, which causes premature fatigue in the shoulders when working against the restriction of the wetsuit. A straighter arm recovery increased the range of movement

her from whom she could gain a tow. 2. We asked her to forget the notion of swimming with a classic high-elbow recovery over the water, which causes premature fatigue in the shoulders when working against the restriction of the wetsuit. A straighter arm recovery increased the range of movement and relaxation in her shoulders. 3. We encouraged Kate to swim more regularly in the wetsuit (both in the pool and open water) and objectively test against the stopwatch which changes were having the greatest impact. --- Page 272 Text --- 4. We refined her drafting skills and then ensured that she practised these skills as regularly as possible with faster swimmers. Kate’s story not only shows how important it is to swim with the right stroke technique in your wetsuit but also the wider potential for making improvements in your performance by adopting the right changes to your stroke for the conditions and environment you are racing in. Whether you are already swimming well in a wetsuit or not, there is plenty of opportunity to improve your performances further using the following tips: 1. Get the Right Fit These days many triathletes buy much of their equipment from on-line stores but a wetsuit should always be tried on before purchasing. Ideally visit a retailer who stocks a range of different suits and be fitted out by an expert. Many stores now have Endless Pools to allow you to test suits before purchasing them, an extremely worthwhile exercise. Like running shoes, you are not looking for the best looking or most expensive suit, you are seeking one that both fits you well and is matched to your stroke type. Take a read through the Swim Types section of this book to discover your Swim Type: If you are an Arnie,

it on frantically. Here are some tips on how to do this properly: Place a plastic bag over your foot like a sock and then slide the wetsuit on like a pair of trousers (Figure 38.29-1), removing the bag once the foot is through the leg of the suit. FIGURE 39.29 Putting on your wetsuit in pictures. --- Page 273 Text --- Slowly creep the wetsuit material up bit by bit starting at the ankles and working it up into the crotch area (Figure 38.29-3 and 38.29-4). Use a pair of gardening gloves with rubber grips to help with this and to avoid putting a hole in the wetsuit with sharp finger nails. Work the material up high enough that it leaves about 10 cm (3–4”) of ankle and lower leg showing. This will let you move the maximum amount of material up so that the crotch is quite tight. If the suit is loose around the crotch area then the suit will be hard to run with into transition and will make your hip flexors work overly hard whilst swimming. Repeat the plastic bag trick for the arms, allowing 5 cm (2”) of wrist to show once the suit is over the shoulders (Figure 38.29-2). Before zipping up, ask a friend to help shoe-horn you into the suit from the back (Figure 29-5) by sliding one hand down the back of your arm and carefully working the wetsuit with the other hand over your shoulders. This will take a couple of extra minutes but it is time well spent as this will give you a much freer feeling around your shoulders during the swim. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and down as your friend zips you up (Figure 38.29-6). Finally, be brave and let a little water in at

couple of extra minutes but it is time well spent as this will give you a much freer feeling around your shoulders during the swim. Squeeze your shoulder blades together and down as your friend zips you up (Figure 38.29-6). Finally, be brave and let a little water in at the neck when you first get into the open water. This will provide a bit of natural lubrication between your skin and the rubber suit that will make for freer movement in the upper torso. 3. Use a Lubricant in Areas that Chaff The neck and armpits are common areas of wetsuit chaffing, particularly in the sea or ocean where the salt can add to the level of abrasion. Apply wetsuit lubricant to these areas to help the neoprene and your skin slide past each other. Also try smearing some lubricant on the suit around the ankles and wrist which will help the suit slide off easier as the material rolls over itself. Some swimmers who really struggle to remove their wetsuit have resorted to cutting a few inches off the legs at an --- Page 274 Text --- angle. If you do this be aware that you will lose some buoyancy in the legs and there’s no going back when it’s done! PAUL: Personally, despite the warnings from manufacturers, I still use Vaseline as a lubricant on my wetsuit. Either that or my new favourite Bepanthen (Australian baby rash cream) – can you tell that I’m a new father? If you’re going to use an oil based lubricant, make sure that you take the time to clean it off properly after your race as it can degrade the material and shorten the life of the suit. ADAM: Don’t fight against the suit, work with it. Try altering your arm

If you’re going to use an oil based lubricant, make sure that you take the time to clean it off properly after your race as it can degrade the material and shorten the life of the suit. ADAM: Don’t fight against the suit, work with it. Try altering your arm recovery over the top of the water to a straighter arm style as we did with Kate, this will avoid tension and premature fatigue in the deltoids. If your arms and shoulders become tired when swimming in a suit are you trying to swim with a classic high- elbow recovery? The solution to this problem isn’t to get in the gym and build up your strength as the extra muscle bulk may actually make the problem worse. Instead, work on a relaxed but straighter arm recovery style. As a bonus this will help give you greater arm clearance over the surface in rougher conditions. Open your elbow angle out in a wetsuit to create a straighter arm recovery, thereby avoiding wetsuit fatigue. PAUL: In some open water swimming and warm water triathlon events around the world ‘swim skins’ like the Blue Seventy Point Zero Three (TX) are still allowed. These suits are like a very thin wetsuit which provide marginal buoyancy benefits, warmth, sun protection and also enhance proprioceptive control through the core abdominal region. The surface of the suit is also aqua-phobic meaning that you slide through the water very easily. We have tested them extensively in the warm waters here in Perth and have found them to be amazingly quick. If your budget will stretch to one we’d highly recommend them for warm water swims. --- Page 275 Text --- CHAPTER 39 Adapting Your Stroke to a Variety of Conditions PAUL: In February 2011 I took a group

to help you perform the exercises in a relaxed manner. Fins are not cheating if you know why you are using them and have a specific purpose in mind, e.g. working on your swimming posture. Some pools, particularly in the UK, have banned the use of fins during public swimming sessions. This is very unfortunate for swimmers trying to develop a good stroke technique, so much so that it is well worth approaching your pool’s management to ask if a specific lane or specific time slot can be allocated where fins are allowed. --- Page 282 Text --- Using fins during your technique training is so important that it’s well worth the journey to a pool slightly further away from you to use them. As a last resort perform the drills without fins but shorten the duration of them. For instance 6-1-6 could be shortened to 4-1-4 or even 2-1-2 and 50 m of a drill could be shortened to 25 m. Swimming these drills without fins is a major disadvantage, seek out any opportunity you can to find a specific session or pool where you are allowed to use them. A Modern Drill Pack If you’re an experienced swimmer you will notice that one or two ‘classic drills’ are missing from this pack. These are deliberate omissions either because they emphasise parts of the stroke which are now understood to cause injury or be inefficient, or because superior modern drills exist with the same purpose. You might notice the following drills are missing: Catch-Up is one of the oldest drills and involves swimming with a full catch-up of the arms at the front of the stroke. The purpose of the drill was to emphasise a front quadrant style of swimming but at the same time it flattened body rotation

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
how you perform. Do you track straight or weave about in the lane? Perform a single arm stroke to swap sides after 25 m, are you better or worse on the other side? Now try the exercise again and become aware of the position of your lead hand. Is it pointing arrow straight down the pool or across the centre line? If it’s crossing over it’s very likely that you do the same thing when extending forwards in your full freestyle stroke. Refer to Chapter 10 on posture and remove the crossover by improving your swimming posture, drawing your shoulder blades together and back. You will track a lot straighter and you should also find it easier to stay perfectly on your side as you perform the drill having much better support from the lead hand. Your objective is to transfer this improved posture into your full stroke. The 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills will help you do that. --- Page 293 Text --- Hand Position As you perform the drill, also check your elbow, wrist and fingertip positioning. Is your elbow higher than your wrist and your wrist higher than your fingertips? Is the palm of your hand facing downward? All of these elements should be in place when performing side kicking. If your hand is angled to the side (like a karate chop) or your elbow and wrist are dropped then it’s very likely that these stroke flaws are present in your full stroke too. Bring the palm of the lead hand to face the bottom of the pool and tip the wrist very slightly so the fingers are lower than the wrist. Don’t do this too much or you will feel your hand being pulled down towards the bottom of the pool. If you have a tendency to

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
after the three strokes: 6-3-breathe-6. If that’s too little breathing, add in a breath during the arm strokes as well. Middle Finger Visualisation A useful visualisation whilst side kicking, and during the arm strokes in 6-1-6 and 6-3- 6, is to think solely about the middle finger on your lead hand and where it is pointing. Keep it pointing straight down the lane at all times. Use this visualisation during full- stroke freestyle too, to help you maintain your alignment as you swim and avoid crossovers. Progressing to Full-Stroke Freestyle The sequence of side kicking, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 progressively builds up the freestyle stroke whilst focusing on your posture and alignment in the water and your catch set-up position with the elbow higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips. The next step is to perform some full-stroke freestyle. We recommend that you perform this immediately after performing the drills, whilst you still have your fins on. For instance: 3x 100 m as : 25 m kick on left side + 25 m kick on right side + 50 m freestyle 4x 100 m as : 2x : 50 m 6-1-6 + 50 m freestyle 2x : 50 m 6-3-6 + 50 m freestyle As you enter into full-stroke freestyle following the drill think about maintaining your alignment and extending your hand in front of the same shoulder. For examples of how we recommend integrating these drills into full training sessions see Appendix C. Broken Arrow The Broken Arrow drill is designed for swimmers with tight shoulders and upper backs to help them loosen off. It’s a derivative of the 6-1-6 drill and should always be performed wearing fins. --- Page 297 Text --- As in 6-1-6, kick on the side but without delay take the top

Broken Arrow drill is designed for swimmers with tight shoulders and upper backs to help them loosen off. It’s a derivative of the 6-1-6 drill and should always be performed wearing fins. --- Page 297 Text --- As in 6-1-6, kick on the side but without delay take the top hand and raise it up vertically over your head and pause it there for two seconds. This is your ‘arrow’. After pausing for a second, break the arrow by bending at the elbow and then spear into the water in front of the head. Rotate on to the other side and breathe before returning your head to the water and lifting your arm on that side. The mantra of the drill is: up - break - spear in - breathe - up - break - speak in - breathe. Whilst your arm is vertical, think about sinking your arm down into the shoulder socket for two seconds before breaking the arrow. This helps you to improve your swimming posture by engaging your scapular. When you have a feel for the rhythm of Broken Arrow, maintain a focus on your lead hand, keeping it straight and aligned by drawing your shoulders back and together. --- Page 298 Text --- Using Broken Arrow You can swim Broken Arrow at any time but as with Shoulder Tap, it’s a perfect drill to add to your warm-up to help you loosen off your shoulders.

with fins as 3x: {50 m Broken Arrow + 50 m freestyle} 100 m easy freestyle with pull buoy --- Page 299 Text --- Popov The Popov drill is used to develop your body rotation and a classic high elbow arm recovery. The drill is named after legendary Russian sprinter Alexander Popov who won the 50m and 100 m freestyle at both the Barcelona and Atlanta Olympics. Alex used the Popov drill successfully in his own swimming preparation. To perform Popov, wear fins and push off from the end of the pool. Move into a side lying position with the bottom hand in front as in all side kicking exercises. Slide the thumb of the top arm up to the armpit. Then return it to the hip before sliding it to the armpit again, at which point bring the hand over and spear into the water to change sides. The movements of the drill are relaxed and quite slow, don’t force or hurry them. The “up - down - up - and through” should be continuous and without pause. If you are very tight in the shoulders you may not be able to reach your armpit with your thumb. In which case perform the drill with the elbow opened out slightly, coming within a few inches of the armpit. Popov helps you to develop a good sense of balance and core control in the water. The drill also emphasises a classic high elbow recovery over the top of the water. High elbow recoveries are seen by many swimmers as an elegant and gracefull way to swim. Whilst this is certainly true, be aware that such a recovery may not suit your individual style. See Chapter 17 on Swim Types. If you intend to swim in open water you will also

High elbow recoveries are seen by many swimmers as an elegant and gracefull way to swim. Whilst this is certainly true, be aware that such a recovery may not suit your individual style. See Chapter 17 on Swim Types. If you intend to swim in open water you will also need to open out the elbow angle so as to gain sufficient hand clearance over disturbed water. Shoulder Tap Shoulder Tap is an excellent drill to work on if you want to achieve a positive spearing hand entry into the water. If you tend to splash down with a flat hand or drop the elbow in first as you enter into the water, Shoulder Tap is for you. You can also use it to help undo a thumb-first entry with the palm facing outwards. --- Page 300 Text --- Use fins and perform a catch-up style of stroke where the hands nearly meet at the front. As the top arm recovers over the water, tap the shoulder lightly and then spear in fingertips first. Make sure the palm of the hand is facing downward as you do so. To help drive good rotation in the drill, breathe on every single stroke to both sides! The mantra of the drills is: breathe - tap - spear in . . . breathe - tap - spear in . . . After performing the drill keep the fins on and transition to full-stroke swimming focusing on good body rotation and a spearing hand entry into the water from a high angle : e.g. 4 × 100 m as: 50 m Shoulder Tap + 50 m freestyle When transitioning to freestyle, imagine a small fish is swimming just in front of you in the water.

entry into the water from a high angle : e.g. 4 × 100 m as: 50 m Shoulder Tap + 50 m freestyle When transitioning to freestyle, imagine a small fish is swimming just in front of you in the water. As you recover the arm and enter into the water you’re aiming to spear the --- Page 301 Text --- fish just in front of your head. This visualisation will help you to develop the positive spearing entry you need in your stroke. Shoulder Tap can help loosen off your shoulders too, which makes it an excellent drill to include in your warm-up. Doggy Paddle Doggy Paddle is perhaps the oldest drill in the book but it’s a great one none the less! This version is swum with more rotation than kid’s doggy paddle and is known as ‘long-dog’ in some parts of the swimming world. Doggy Paddle is a powerful drill for developing your catch and ‘feel for the water’ as it forces you to develop an early bent elbow catch. Performing the drill with a straight --- Page 302 Text --- arm catch, which many swimmers use in their full stroke, is nearly impossible! If you struggle to perform the drill it’s likely that you are in the habit of catching the water with a straight arm, in which case this drill will be very useful for you indeed. Performing Doggy Paddle As with sculling drills, always use a pull buoy with Doggy Paddle to avoid any assistance from the legs. Push off from the wall and start performing strokes, returning the recovering arm forwards underwater. This underwater recovery might feel odd at first. Don’t worry too much about your return path, simply slip the hand forwards fingertips first as easily as you can. Emphasise ‘reaching over

you to begin pressing the water backwards at this critical point of the stroke. If you struggle to perform this drill at first don’t be put off, this simply highlights that the catch is a weak point in your stroke and that you will benefit greatly from developing your ‘feel for the water’ in this position. Performing the Drill Always use a pull buoy between your legs when sculling so as not to gain any assistance from your leg kick. Push off and bring your head out of the water, and begin sculling left and right in front of the head. Come slightly wider than your shoulders and bring your hands together so that they nearly touch in front of your head: Change the angle of your hand slightly so that you are leading the scull with the palm of your hand. You’re looking to keep a constant pressure on the palm of the hand from the water. At all times keep your fingertips lower than your wrist and your wrist lower than your elbow – you may be surprised at how low you have to go with your fingers to achieve this position. If you stay too shallow with your hands your forward progress will be slow or non-existent: Just like in full-stroke freestyle, by showing the palm of your hand slightly backwards you will be propelled forwards. Sculling drills move you through the water at a slow pace but get the drill right and you will feel your chest lift up in the water and your pace increase. --- Page 305 Text --- When you are getting a good feel for the drill deliberately accentuate this position by drawing your shoulder blades back and lifting your chest high. This introduces good swimming posture into the drill. Sculling is

chest lift up in the water and your pace increase. --- Page 305 Text --- When you are getting a good feel for the drill deliberately accentuate this position by drawing your shoulder blades back and lifting your chest high. This introduces good swimming posture into the drill. Sculling is best performed over short distances of 10–20 m before being immediately transitioned into full-stroke freestyle. For instance, complete the following four times through with 15 seconds recovery in between: 100 m as 15 m Scull #1 into 85 m freestyle As you transition into freestyle, think about lightly pressing the water back to the wall behind you. Use the Smiley Face On The Palm Of Your Hand visualisation described in Chapter 13 to help reinforce this. Don’t be surprised if your stroke rate picks up slightly when swimming after sculling, that’s a good sign that you’ve improved your catch technique – go with it! Scull #1 can be used in combination with other drills, for instance: --- Page 306 Text --- 10 m Scull #1 + 10 m Scull #2 + 30 m swim 10 m Scull #1 + 15 m Doggy Paddle + 25 m swim Scull #1 is a mainstay of the Swim Smooth drill pack, perform it regularly in your training sessions to develop and maintain your ‘feel for the water’. Scull #2 Scull #2 is similar to Scull #1 but it focuses on an area of the stroke directly under the head as the swimmer transitions from the catch to the pull phase. This drill is very useful if you have a tendency to pull wide with your arm stroke or pull through with a straight arm. As with Scull #1, always use a pull buoy and push off with your head above the surface, looking

you feel like you are bobbing up and down a lot then this highlights that you are pressing down on the water at the front of the stroke. This only lifts you up, which doesn’t generate any propulsion and acts to sink your legs, creating drag. If you feel like you are bobbing vertically then you need to work on a better catch action, pressing the water backwards, not downward. The King of Drills --- Page 309 Text --- At Swim Smooth we call Unco “The King Of Drills”. This is because it is beneficial to almost any swimmer, even elite swimmers. Unco also helps you to put all the elements of your stroke together, making sure that everything works with the right timing – no other drill does this nearly as well. You will feel the magic of Unco when you swim normal freestyle immediately after performing the drill. We recommend you perform a short swim every time following Unco, keeping the fins on and just feeling the easy rhythm and timing of the arm stroke. The improved smoothness and efficiency can be a revelation! Paddle-Unco: “P-Unco” Performing Unco with a small pair of paddles can be useful as it increases the working area of the hand, which improves your awareness during the catch phase at the front of the stroke. Use a small pair of paddles for this purpose, keeping a small amount of pressure under your fingertips as you use them. We recommend the Finis Freestyler paddles. Only perform P-Unco in small doses as the paddles increase the load on your shoulders. Most of the time we recommend normal Unco in your drill sets but the addition of P-Unco can make for an interesting and stimulating change. --- Page 310 Text --- Breathe away from the stroking

Only perform P-Unco in small doses as the paddles increase the load on your shoulders. Most of the time we recommend normal Unco in your drill sets but the addition of P-Unco can make for an interesting and stimulating change. --- Page 310 Text --- Breathe away from the stroking arm and breathe on every single stroke – even if you don’t feel that you need to – this helps to drive your body rotation. We suggest that you start with your right arm stroking and breathe to your left as shown in the pictures. Once you get the feel of the drill swap sides every 25 m or so. The key to this drill is to make sure that you rotate your body fully to the dead side as shown in the last picture. There’ll be a temptation not to do this, the key is ensuring that you dip your non-stroking arm and shoulder down into the water as shown in the last picture. --- OCR from Page 310 Image 1 --- dip this ‘dead’ shoulder down into the water --- Page 311 Text --- The mantra of the drill is ‘stroke and dip . . . stroke and dip . . .’. You will really have to emphasise dipping the ‘dead’ shoulder into the water as there’s no arm stroke on that side to help you. The body rotation within the drill is critical. Get it right and your stroking arm will recover easily over the top of the water. However, stay flat on that dead side and the arm recovery will be very tough! If you struggle to coordinate the drill don’t worry, that’s normal – in fact that’s the whole idea and it simply highlights that the timing of your stroke may need some work. When

position and so your drag profile in the water. As you swim after these drills become aware of how high your legs are in the water, you are looking to feel your ankles gently breaking the surface but do not do that by bending at the knees! You’ll know when you get this right as you will slip much more easily through the water. 4. Work on your swimming posture using the YTWL exercise (Chapter 29) and Kick On Side, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills. Not only will these drills help you remove crossovers from your stroke they will also improve your body rotation. Becoming straighter and more aligned in the water is critical for your progress as an Arnie and should be a constant focus for you as you continue to develop as a swimmer. Crossovers have a habit of coming back without constant maintenance! 5. Focus on your initial catch and pull using the Doggy Paddle and Scull #1 drills. The key goal here is to focus on pressing the water backwards from in front of the head after hand entry and extension rather than pushing it downward. This will give you greater propulsion and act to keep your legs higher in the water. Remove the crossover from your stroke by drawing your shoulders back and chest forwards whilst performing the side-kicking drills. --- Page 316 Text --- 6. Experiment with a straighter arm recovery to help overcome any restriction in your shoulders or upper back. A classic high elbow recovery requires good flexibility and range of motion in these two areas and does not suit some swimmers with limited range of movement. See Chapter 11. 7. Try lowering your stroke rate slightly, ideally using a stroke-rate beeper such as a Wetronome or Tempo Trainer Pro. Lowering your natural

elbow recovery requires good flexibility and range of motion in these two areas and does not suit some swimmers with limited range of movement. See Chapter 11. 7. Try lowering your stroke rate slightly, ideally using a stroke-rate beeper such as a Wetronome or Tempo Trainer Pro. Lowering your natural stroke rate by 3–5 strokes per minute is not a huge change but gives you time to lengthen out your stroke and develop that body rotation in conjunction with step 4. 8. Use a regular stretching routine to loosen off your shoulders, upper back, hip flexors and ankles. These four areas are restricted in many Arnies and making even small improvements in your flexibility will pay real dividends for your swimming. See Chapter 29. Experiment with a range of head positions to see which works best for you. Head Position Many Arnies have been told to look straight down when they swim to help bring their legs up. As discussed in Chapter 8, this is an option for you but we encourage you to keep a more neutral head position if possible as it help you to develop your catch and --- OCR from Page 316 Image 1 --- = ri "TE REEELE LEE. TES NN = sttees Bevis: FIPS 2 aaleitae --- Page 317 Text --- your navigation in open water. Only look straight down if you cannot lift your body position right up using the process listed above. Kick Timing As discussed in Chapter 9 there are two main ways of kicking in swimming, a 6-beat kick or a slower 2-beat kick. You may have heard about the efficiency benefits of using a 2-beat kick but for most Arnies with low-lying legs a light 6-beat kick will suit you much better as it will help to keep your

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
Despite having powerful leg kicks, many Kicktastics kick hard from the knee rather than kicking with a relatively straight leg from the hip. Developing an improved kicking technique will reduce the oxygen demand from the kick, making breathing much easier. 3. Work on improving posture and rotation using the Kick On Side and then 6-1- 6 and 6-3-6 drills. Poor body rotation is a feature of the Kicktastic’s stroke and is often accompanied by a crossover in front of the head. Many other Swim Types would experience a scissor kick as a result of the crossover but Kicktastics normally do not as the strong 6-beat kick smothers this tendency. However, the crossover is still very damaging for a swimmer’s catch, which requires good alignment into the water. These drills will also improve a Kicktastic’s swimming posture, which is often quite poor and results in them swimming quite flat in the water (see Chapter 11). As you perform the side-kicking exercises work on opening up your chest and drawing your shoulder blades together and back. This will help drive body rotation and set up for a propulsive arm stroke. 4. Develop your catch mechanics using the Scull #1 and Doggy Paddle drills. As a Kicktastic you can expect these drills to feel quite alien and challenging at first, which simply highlights the catch as a weak point in your stroke. Perform the drills using a pull buoy and resist the temptation to add a little kick to the drill – that is very much cheating! Perform Scull #1 first, focusing on developing a good catch position with the elbows higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips. Once you are beginning to feel the water on the palms of your hands, move on and try Doggy --- Page

stroke flaws in place and if you compare yourself to other swimmers in public swim sessions you’ll be swimming significantly better than most there. Don’t let this go to your head though: the fact is that very few good freestyle swimmers are seen in public sessions. You can really take your swimming to the next level if you buy into proper freestyle technique through developing your catch and improving your rhythm and timing using the process below. 1. Brush up on your exhalation technique into the water using the Sink Down and Breathe - Bubble - Bubble - Breathe exercises listed in Appendix A. Developing your exhalation into the water will help you feel much more relaxed when you swim and is one of the keys to allowing you to breathe bilaterally. 2. Give your kicking technique a quick once-over using the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick and Swim Back exercises. Overgliders normally pride themselves on their efficiency in the water and generally understand the importance of kicking from the hip rather than the knee. However, if you use a 2-beat kick you are quite likely to be bending significantly at the knee to provide you with the impetus to restart your stroke. You should be able to brush up your kicking technique quite easily using the exercises, which, as a consequence, will also help raise your body position higher in the water. 3. Work on improving posture and catch set-up using the Kick On Side and then 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills. If you are crossing over in your stroke it is essential that you remove this by drawing your shoulders down and back as you swim. Not only will this help you to swim straighter but it will also set you up for a good catch to follow.

and 6-3-6 drills. If you are crossing over in your stroke it is essential that you remove this by drawing your shoulders down and back as you swim. Not only will this help you to swim straighter but it will also set you up for a good catch to follow. Also, work on improving your hand and wrist position whilst kicking on your side, keeping the palm facing downward, the elbow higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips. Whilst this will not remove the dead spot from your stroke by itself, it is an essential first step in the process as it improves your catch set-up. You may also find that you need to go a little deeper in the water with your lead hand than you expected in order to get into a good catch set-up position. After making these changes to your stroke you may already notice your stroke rate start to lift up naturally – that is a very good sign that you are making real progress. 4. Develop your catch mechanics using the Scull #1 and Doggy Paddle drills. As an Overglider you might find these drills quite challenging at first as they highlight the weak point in your stroke technique. With Scull #1 focus on ‘reaching over the barrel’ and getting into that good high elbow position with the fingertips lower than the wrist and the wrist lower than the elbow. Feel the water on the palm of your hand in this position. Whilst performing Doggy Paddle emphasise bending the elbow early in front of your head and keep your lead hand constantly in motion – either extending forwards, catching the water or pressing it backwards but never pausing! Keeping the arms and hands constantly in motion might feel very alien

stroke rhythm who needs a tune-up. --- Page 326 Text --- 2. Work on improving posture and alignment in the water using the Kick On Side and then 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills. After many years of swimming, Swingers often slip into a few bad habits and start to cross over in their strokes both in front of the head and below the body. We’ll use the Doggy Paddle and Scull #2 drills later to reinforce pulling down the centre line of the body under the water and not crossing over. The overall effect of these drills may be a slight drop in your stroke rate but a slight lengthening of your stroke, which will offset this. We are not trying to kill your rhythm here, but just to strike the right balance between the length of your stroke and the rate of your stroke. 3. Pay attention to your hand entry with the objective of removing a thumb-first entry technique from your stroke. As described in Chapter 12, a thumb-first entry is the most common cause of shoulder pain and injury and should be avoided at all costs. To help remove a thumb-first entry use the Shoulder Tap drill and the two visualisations from Chapter 12: Hide The Palm and Briefcase Carry. Choose the visualisation that feels best for you and return to it when swimming in your normal training to help break the habit. A thumb-first entry can be a difficult habit to break so be persistent here! 4. Tune up your catch and pull mechanics by using the Scull #1, Scull #2 and Doggy Paddle drills. Working on your catch and ‘feel for the water’ is a critical area for improvement for you as a Swinger. You may find it best to slow down your stroke a touch

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
Tune up your catch and pull mechanics by using the Scull #1, Scull #2 and Doggy Paddle drills. Working on your catch and ‘feel for the water’ is a critical area for improvement for you as a Swinger. You may find it best to slow down your stroke a touch to take a little more time over your catch, if you have a Wetronome or Finis Tempo Trainer Pro try lowering your stroke rate by 3–5 strokes per minute. This will help you to develop your ‘feel for the water’ and give you the time to engage with it properly, increasing your propulsion. Doggy Paddle and Scull #2 drills are great for removing any crossovers under the body where the hand crosses the centre line. These are common to see with --- Page 327 Text --- Swingers and will cause you to lose propulsion and weave from side to side slightly as you swim. Visualise a rope under your body and pull down this rope as you swim – focus on not crossing over the centre line! Work on fixing that tendency to cross the centre line under your body – it will lose you propulsion, put stress on your shoulder and cause you to weave slightly down the lane. 5. Reconnect with your rhythm and timing using the Unco drill. After improving your posture and catch mechanics using the above process you will have refined your pull-through technique and will be getting a greater purchase on the water. However, these changes may well have subtly altered the timing of your stroke, which may feel strange at first. To help synchronise these changes to your body rotation use the Unco drill, focusing on the mantra Stroke And Dip as you do so. Feel how your body rotation drives the stroke,

these changes may well have subtly altered the timing of your stroke, which may feel strange at first. To help synchronise these changes to your body rotation use the Unco drill, focusing on the mantra Stroke And Dip as you do so. Feel how your body rotation drives the stroke, and, when you start swimming, feel that easy rhythm to your stroke. As discussed above, you may end up at a slightly lower stroke rate than you are used to. That is fine if it means better alignment and propulsion in your stroke as you will be swimming quicker overall. 6. Optional: formalise your 2-beat kick using the process below. This is an advanced skill and is only suitable for Swingers whose strokes are becoming quite refined. A 2-beat kick only really suits swimmers with fast stroke rates – those with a slower stroke rate are normally much more suited to a light 6-beat flutter kick. Kick on your front with fins on and both arms down by your side. Use a deep vertical scissoring of the legs to kick – we are looking for large movements switching between the two positions: left leg up + right leg down and right leg up + left leg down. As you kick down with one leg, dip the opposite shoulder into the water. --- Page 328 Text --- As you kick notice how the opposite shoulder naturally dips into the water. Continue this for at least 50 m, becoming used to the sensation, making it feel quite snappy through the hips and core. Keep the fins on and move to a lap of freestyle only breathing to the left. As your right hand enters into the water, roll and breathe to the left and simultaneously try the big deep kick down with

shown on the bottom row. The head rotates to breathe in time with the extension of the arm forwards. 6. Rhythm and timing is an important component of any great freestyle stroke and after steps 1–5 it is time to revisit it in your stroke. Use the Unco drill to help time your arm stroke with your body rotation. You will find that a smooth catch is essential during the drill as well as an emphasis on dipping the ‘dead’ shoulder down on every stroke. The magic of Unco is experienced when you start swimming immediately following the drill – you should feel super-smooth (even for you) and perhaps get some flashbacks to your best days in the water. If you feel that you have a tendency to add a slight overglide into your stroke then the Waterpolo and Pull Buoy and Bands drills are well worth adding to your training routine as they will move you towards a more continuous flowing extension and catch. 7. Pay attention to your stroke completion at the hip. The Unco drill in step 5 has focused a little on this area already but some additional focus might be useful if you have a tendency to over-emphasise the back of your stroke. A distinct push at the rear is not advisable as it creates a dead spot in its own right and can create a flicking movement into the air. This flick makes for an awkward arm recovery and --- Page 331 Text --- can cause pain in the elbow known as ‘Golfer’s Elbow’, or more correctly as Medial Epicondylitis.

can cause pain in the elbow known as ‘Golfer’s Elbow’, or more correctly as Medial Epicondylitis. For more information see Chapter 13. The rear of the stroke should be completed without locking the elbow straight as shown here. It should also finish with a slight inwards turn of the hand towards the top of the thigh to complete the stroke and make for a nice hand exit. Try this the next time you swim and notice how powerful but smooth it feels. Turn the hand in slightly towards the top of the thigh to complete the stroke and exit cleanly. 8. Fine tune your stroke rate using a stroke rate beeper such as a Wetronome. This is a great way to reinforce the good work you have performed on your alignment, catch and timing. You may well find that you can increase your stroke rate slightly after this work, which will help the rhythm of your stroke. If your objective is to perform well in open water races then this is critical. You are not looking to lift your stroke rate by deliberately shortening the stroke – you still start at full extension and finish each stroke at the same point on the hip. Instead you get into your catch a little bit quicker at the front, emphasising stroke length less and focusing on rhythm instead. --- Page 332 Text --- 9. Add some new fitness training elements to mundane interval sessions using our advice on training in Key 2 of this book. If you have a strong sprint background, this type of threshold-based training at CSS pace (Critical Swim Speed) when combined with a lap interval beeper like the Wetronome or Finis Tempo Trainer Pro can really add an exciting and motivating element to your sessions, especially if you

course required to wear some sort of swimsuit. Suit design has changed dramatically over the years, and today males typically opt for a brief or “jammer,” which runs from waist to just above the knee. These formfitting suits are typically made of a material that stretches, such as nylon, spandex, polyester, or a combination thereof. Females typically wear a one-piece suit that covers the body from the mid-thighs to the shoulders; suits vary in style and cut. For training purposes, swimmers may opt to use any of a variety of suits that are less expensive or less restrictive or provide some extra element for training purposes, such as the increased drag of looser suits. Goggles Goggles have been around for a long time but came into widespread use only in the 1970s; they are now considered an integral part of sport swimming. For several reasons, goggles come in many styles. How does one know which style to buy? Some styles are geared toward a particular activity, such as scuba diving, snorkeling, or triathlon, and others are available in different sizes, shapes, and tints. Quality should be assessed on the basis not of price but of fit. The best goggles are the ones that fit you—that is, the ones that fit your face comfortably and keep the water out. Remember, their purpose is to enhance your vision and reduce eye irritation from pool chemicals or, in open-water environments, other sources. To test the fit, place the eyepieces on your eye sockets, below the bony part where the eyebrows are located, in the softer part of each socket. Without using the strap, press the goggles gently onto this soft tissue and see if they stay even for just a few seconds; if they do, you have a good fit! The strap merely

buoys, and snorkels. Kickboards The kickboard (figure 2) is a fairly common piece of equipment found in many swim- mers’ training bags. It is typically made of some sort of foam to provide flotation. Its purpose is to provide a buoyancy assist so that swimmers can isolate and train the kicking motion. It is often used to train all four competitive strokes. Figure 2 Two different styles of kickboards. xv --- Page 17 Text --- The Sport of Swimming Fins Fins are commonly used in swim training to add resistance to the kicking motion, helping the person to swim more easily or to make the workout harder. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes (figure 3), and some are designed specifically for a cer- tain competitive stroke—for example, the monofin and the breaststroke fin. Monof- ins are a training tool specific to dolphin kick. Breastroke fins are also very specific to that kick and, due to the increase in pressure on the groin area and the inside of the knee, should probably be used only under the supervision of a knowledgeable coach and with a swimmer who has had sufficient technique training and the strength to benefit from the extra resistance. For training purposes, fins with medium-size blades work for most swimmers, though it is a good idea to use shorter blades in the beginning in order to prevent injury. People who have less strength or flexibility in the lower extremities—especially the ankles—should definitely use a medium or shorter blade of 6 to 9 inches (about 15 to 23 centimeters) to prevent overstressing those joints with the added pressure and resistance created by longer blades (often seen in scuba shops). In addition, short-blade fins (shorter than 6 inches, or 15 cen- timeters) are often used to work with

shorter blade of 6 to 9 inches (about 15 to 23 centimeters) to prevent overstressing those joints with the added pressure and resistance created by longer blades (often seen in scuba shops). In addition, short-blade fins (shorter than 6 inches, or 15 cen- timeters) are often used to work with just a little extra resistance while maintaining kicking cadence and rhythm. As with goggles, fit is very important. A good fit is not too tight or loose, and some swimmers prefer a sock as it makes the fin more comfort- able. This is very similar to trying on shoes. Figure 3 Fins of various lengths. Paddles Like goggles and fins, paddles for swimming come in a variety of shapes and sizes (figure 4). Paddles are often used to create extra resistance by increasing the sur- face area of the hands. As with fins, great care should be taken when using paddles because the increased pressure on the water creates extra stress on the joints—in this case the shoulders. As a result, novices should use smaller paddles in order to mini- mize the risk of injury. xvi --- Page 18 Text --- The Sport of Swimming Figure 4 Paddles. Sizes and shapes vary widely depending on manufacturer and purpose. Pull Buoys A pull buoy (figure 5) is fitted between the thighs, just above the knees, and the swimmer keeps it in place by squeezing the thighs together. This arrangement pre- vents the swimmer from using any effective kick in the freestyle or backstroke, thus isolating and training the pulling motion of the swimming arm stroke. Figure 5 Pull bouys. Size and shape will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Snorkel The swimmer’s snorkel is a fairly recent development (figure 6). Of course, traditional side-mounted snorkels have been around for years, but the

FloaTing on your FronT The next skill in this step involves floating on your front. This is essentially the same skill as floating on your back—and the same physics apply—but with the added element that your face is in the water. As a result, you can practice two skills at once: floating and exhaling with your face in the water. Front Floating With Arms Extended From a standing position in the water, lie on the water in a position not unlike the starfish discussed earlier. The objective here is to keep your head, shoulders, hips, hands, and feet all at the surface of the water (figure 1.4). You can try this first exercise while holding your breath. One indicator of success is being able to look straight down at the bottom of the pool while relaxing on the water in a horizontal position with your back straight.

Press your chest toward the bottom of the pool and bring your hips up. drills For PracTicing FronT FloaTing As you have learned by now, floating on the front is fundamentally different from floating on the back. Because of being facedown rather than faceup, you do not have the freedom to breathe whenever you want to. The key to becoming comfortable in the facedown position is to practice certain drills, which can move you toward being as comfortable in this position as you are on your back. Front-Floating Drill 1 Push-off Stand at the side of the pool, sink under the water, and draw your feet up to the wall. Next, push off horizontally and work to rise to the surface and float horizontally, as before, by lying on the water. For many swimmers, this drill requires more than one try. Here is the sequence once again: sink under the water, draw your feet up to the wall, and gently push off with your feet. You have succeeded when you can do the drill repeatedly with your legs together and your arms crossed. The purpose of this drill is to

balance and a solid foundation that ena- bles you to apply force to the water. As discussed earlier, it is critical to locate your center of balance and be comfortable in the water. Return for a moment to the teeter-totter analogy and the fact that your center of buoyancy lies in the middle of your chest. If you stand poolside with your arms at 14 --- Page 34 Text --- Floating your sides, about two-thirds of your personal teeter-totter—that is, everything from your chest to your feet—lies below your center of buoyancy. In order to achieve a good swimming position, you need to bring the teeter-totter back into balance. To that end, as soon as you raise your arms above your head, about half of your length is above your center of buoyancy and the other half is below it. There is a time when the body is extended in this fashion in each of the four competitive strokes. Finding Your Balance on Your Back If starting with the back float, the objective is to raise your arms above your head and stretch them as far as you can. Be as long as you can from fingertips to toe tips and still maintain a good floating position. Note that in this position, you have very few ways to manipulate the water for lateral balance. Learning balance in this position can prove challenging for people with limited flexibility or limited range of motion in the shoulders. You have succeeded when you can maintain a relaxed floating posi- tion with your hands extended beyond your head. Use the following steps to find your balance while floating on your back.

Make adjustments to the position of your upper back and hips to ensure that the hands, shoulders, hips, and toes are all at the top of the water. Streamlined Floating on Your Back The next skill in floating on your back is to establish a streamlined position (figure 1.7)—one in which you are not only as long as you can be (from fingertips to toe tips) but also as skinny as possible. This streamlining reduces drag force (discussed in step 2) and sets you up to move through the water more effectively in later stages of the learning process. A good streamline involves certain key elements—extending the body into a line as long as possible from fingertips to toe tips, keeping the core tight, and making yourself as skinny as possible—starting at the fingertips and working down from there. 15 --- Page 35 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 1.7 sTreamlined FloaTing on your Back Preparation Execution 1.

Your hand position should be loose rather than rigid. Though some people advocate holding the hand like a paddle or spoon, a rigid hand position provides no meaningful hydro- dynamic advantage for most swimmers. The hand should be slightly curved like the blade of a propeller on a plane or boat. The curvature provides great ability to produce higher and lower areas of pressure similar to that also of an airplane wing. Stand in the water with your back to the pool wall. Extend your arms straight out in front of you and sink to the point where your shoulders are just below the surface and your arms are completely covered with water. With your hands in a natural, relaxed position and slightly cupped, rotate your thumbs down so that your palms are angled slightly rather than parallel to the pool bottom. Next, sweep your hands outward, making sure to keep your elbows straight. You should feel pressure from the water on

on his name despite being characterized as un-European barbaric thrashing. Around the turn of the century in Australia, a similar stroke was used with a flutter kick by a Solomon Islander named Alick Wickham. That version was devel- oped further by coach Richmond “Dick” Cavill into what we now recognize as some- thing closer to freestyle, which was referred to as the Australian crawl. In the modern era, coaches added a six-beat (i.e., six kicks per one arm stroke) kick, and the stroke became the front crawl, which later came to be referred to simply as freestyle. Tech- nically speaking, freestyle races can be swum using any stroke, but the crawl stroke is the fastest of the competitive strokes and therefore has become synonymous with freestyle. The Three rs Good freestyle depends on the three Rs: reach, rotation, and relaxation. Reach is dis- cussed with the catch and pull. Rotation involves turning the body over by rotating around the anchor point—the hand. It is crucial to ensure that your hip and shoulder stay in the same plane. Relaxation involves learning to relax the body parts that are not helping you swim more efficiently. Good freestyle is efficient and effective. Swimmers who master freestyle find it is as easy as walking. To that end, this step helps you develop the following skills: • Horizontal body line • Rotation on a long axis • High elbow catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Kicking rhythm • Effective breathing • Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective freestyle stroke. 51 --- Page 71 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success One key element of effective freestyle is maintaining a good horizontal position on the water. As mastered in step

Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective freestyle stroke. 51 --- Page 71 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success One key element of effective freestyle is maintaining a good horizontal position on the water. As mastered in step 1 (specifically, floating on your front), the basic position involves lying on the water with your head, hips, feet, and hands all at the surface of the water. As you remain stretched out on the water, ensure that your face is in the water and that you are looking straight down at the bottom of the pool. Basic FreesTyle sTrOke A good freestyle armstroke consists of four basic elements that provide the bulk of the propulsive force for swimming: catch, pull, finish, and recovery. The first is the catch. Beginning with the left hand, you will want to pitch the fingers down so that the hand is perpendicular to the direction you want to go (figure 3.1a). As the hand pitches down, you will rotate the elbow and shoulder so that the forearm is also per- pendicular to the direction you want to go. The second element is the pull. During this part of the stroke, you will pull the arm through so that the hand and forearm stay perpendicular to the direction you are going and the elbow remains bent (figure 3.1b). The finish of the stroke is next (figure 3.1c). As you progress through the middle and your arm is about midway down your body, you will transition from a pulling motion to that of a pushing motion almost as if you were going to try to slap your thigh with your hand. Lastly is the recovery (figure 3.1d). At this point you will raise the arm out

arm is about midway down your body, you will transition from a pulling motion to that of a pushing motion almost as if you were going to try to slap your thigh with your hand. Lastly is the recovery (figure 3.1d). At this point you will raise the arm out of the water almost as if pulling your hand out of your pocket and bring it back to the front position where you started by sliding your hand fingers first into the water 8 to 10 inches above your head and extending the arm fully after that. Repeat this same motion with your right arm and hand and then stop. Remember that as you work on mastering a skill, it is crucial to move in a slow and controlled manner at first. As you may notice, kicking is not mentioned here; this does not mean that you should not kick but simply that you should focus on the skill being described.

image helps you remember to finish the stroke. FreesTyle sTrOke cycle Once you have gone through one stroke cycle—one right arm and one left arm—it is time to put together multiple stroke cycles (figure 3.2). Remember that (unlike in some other sports) faster is not always better in swimming. Keep your movements slow and deliberate. The real objective in this part of your development is to anchor your hand and forearm in the water and pull yourself over them. Stop when you need air.

Repeat this process several times, trying to get farther down the pool with the same b number of strokes. c MissTep You make a lot of splashing and thrashing movements. cOrrecTiOn Splashing and thrashing indicate that the water is absorbing your energy and thus becoming turbulent. Turbulence makes it difficult to put pressure on the water. To correct this misstep, think about slipping your hand into a glove during the recovery (reentry into the water) and slapping your thigh at the end of the stroke. It is best to use long, controlled movements. MissTep You cannot get your arm fully out of the water on the recovery. cOrrecTiOn As you finish the stroke, rotate your hip on the same side as the stroking arm and the shoulder of your stroking arm toward the sky. This action allows your upper arm to be more vertical without reach- ing behind your back, which is not an easy

This action allows your upper arm to be more vertical without reach- ing behind your back, which is not an easy position to attain and expends considerable energy. 55 --- Page 75 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Drills FOr arMsTrOkes The fastest and most efficient freestyle swimmers—whether in a race or in the work- out pool—tend to share certain characteristics. The hands always pass in front of the swimmer; the hands and forearms are perpendicular to the direction of travel for the maximum amount of time; and the hands accelerate throughout the course of the stroke under the water. To develop these characteristics, use the following drills. Note that some of the drills involve overcorrection of common flaws, but all of them help you develop elements of good freestyle. Armstroke Drill 1 catch-Up This drill helps you with balance, rhythm, and armstrokes; it also helps you develop great kinesthetic awareness and is especially helpful to tactile learners. To perform this drill, stand on the pool deck and form the index finger and thumb of your left hand into an L shape with the other fingers also extended. Next, create the mirror image of that shape (i.e., a backward L shape) with your right hand. Now, without looking, raise your hands above your head and try to touch just the tips of your thumbs together. In the pool, lie in a horizontal position in the water. This is the same position to which your hands will recover as one hand “catches up” to the other. Make sure that only the tips of your thumbs touch each other, thus leaving your arms

of your thumbs together. In the pool, lie in a horizontal position in the water. This is the same position to which your hands will recover as one hand “catches up” to the other. Make sure that only the tips of your thumbs touch each other, thus leaving your arms about head- width apart. As you start the catch, make sure that you are doing the drill slowly enough to concentrate on getting your fingers down and your elbow up and pushing all the way through. You can expect some body rotation, which works to your advan- tage. As a larger portion of your body is out of the water, the coefficient of drag for air is much lower than that of water, which is more than 500 times as dense. This larger coefficient means that the more of you that is in the water, the more drag force needs to be overcome. Perform this drill with a comfortable rhythmic flutter kick. TO increase DiFFicUlTy • Close your eyes as before and complete 10 armstrokes in a 25-yard (or 25-meter) pool, making sure that only your thumb tips touch. • Perform six kicks per armstroke.

Armstroke Drill 2 Underwater recovery This is a great drill for focusing on just the catch and the pull. Lie flat in the water, then catch and pull with one arm and then with the other. As you finish the stroke at your thigh, instead of recovering your hand and arm over the water, slide your hand forward as far as you can to catch up with your other hand, then repeat with your opposite arm. This approach reduces the need to worry about the recovery. TO increase DiFFicUlTy • Perform six kicks per stroke.

Some competitors swim flatter, with little rotation, whereas others swim through the hips with considerable rotation. Both approaches can be correct, depend- ing on the swimmer, but the most sustainable recreational swimming allows for most people to use the core to aid in rotation rather than relying on spinal flexibility. Some swimmers have more flexibility and strength in the spine and torso, allowing them to twist easier. Rotation Drill 1 Tap your head This drill gives you feedback about where your hands are in relation to the centerline of your body and your axis of rotation, as well as the vertical position of your head. It also compels you to rotate your body to perform the drill correctly. With all that said, the drill itself is very simple. Gently touch your fingertips to the crown of your head on the recovery, then place your hand in the water to recover for the next catch and pull. As in the catch-up drill, wait until one hand has completely recovered before beginning the next catch. TO increase DiFFicUlTy • Perform six kicks per stroke.

Swimmers who swim “flat” rather than rotating will find their feet fishtailing all over the pool.

BreaThing As land-based creatures, we cannot process oxygen out of water as fish do; therefore, we must find a way to breathe air while swimming. In freestyle, this need is met by rotating the head so that the mouth and nose are out of the water at a good time during the stroke cycle (figure 3.4), thus allowing the swimmer to breathe without interrupting his or her rhythm. The best way to do so is to rotate the face out of the water as an arm is finishing a stroke at the thigh and beginning the recovery. The rotation is initiated at the shoulder and hip, and the head follows. This technique is less about rotating the neck and more about proper positioning. There is a bow wave with the forward propulsion that allows for a

is finishing a stroke at the thigh and beginning the recovery. The rotation is initiated at the shoulder and hip, and the head follows. This technique is less about rotating the neck and more about proper positioning. There is a bow wave with the forward propulsion that allows for a trough to be pro- duced; the depth and utility of that differ from swimmer to swimmer. A bow wave in the world of fluid mechanics is a wave that is produced by the vector displacement of water by another object. The size of the crest and trough produced depends on the mass, velocity, and displacement buoyancy of the object. As the body moves through the water, the crown of the head will cause the water in front of it to increase in pressure as the head moves forward. The water will seek equilibrium from this high pressure state by moving to a lower pressure. Due to the incompressibility of water, the water molecules “choose” a direction to go with some moving down and others moving up or to the side with and infinite number of vector possibilities. The rising part is offset by a falling part producing both a crest and a trough which is below the waterline and will be helpful when trying to rotate the mouth and nose toward the air to breathe. The objective here is to get your air as quickly as possible so that you can get your face back in the water before your hand finishes the recovery, thus readying you for the next catch. 62 --- Page 82 Text --- Freestyle Figure 3.4 single-sTrOke BreaThing Preparation 1.

While stroking with your arms, slowly exhale until you have expelled much of the air from your lungs. 2. As you finish your next stroke, rotate your body and face so that your face is out of the water, then breathe in and stop. b At this point, you should be on your side or back with one arm at your side and the other arm above your head, in front of your shoulder. Practice this sequence several times. Most people prefer one side or the other for rotation, so multiple repeats are helpful to identify which side is preferred. Then move on to continuous breathing (figure 3.5). 63 --- Page 83 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 3.5 cOnTinUOUs BreaThing Preparation 1.

MissTep Your hips sink when you go to breathe. cOrrecTiOn Make sure that you are looking to the side of the pool rather than lift- ing your head to look forward. 64 --- Page 84 Text --- Freestyle Drills FOr BreaThing Breathing is more about timing than about anything else. Swimming is one of only a few sports in which your breathing is a life-and-death decision. When running or partici- pating in other sports, your respiration is not really something you have to consciously think about when participating. Swimming on the other had is different. Inhaling with your face in the water will produce some unwanted consequences, including death. This factor is particularly important for new swimmers. As you progress through the skills, you may find yourself holding your breath, which is a mistake. Make sure to exhale slowly and inhale rhythmically rather than gulping at the air. Breathing Drill 1 One-arm The one-arm freestyle drill comes in several versions. One of the most effective approaches is to stroke with only one arm down the length of the pool with the other arm at your side. On every stroke, breathe to the nonstroking side and be sure to rotate to the stroking side. The timing of this drill is crucial. It must be done slowly, and the shoulder of the stroking arm should be touching your ear when you breathe. In addition, your stroking arm should be fully extended until your face is back in the water to initiate the catch.

stroking side. The timing of this drill is crucial. It must be done slowly, and the shoulder of the stroking arm should be touching your ear when you breathe. In addition, your stroking arm should be fully extended until your face is back in the water to initiate the catch. Repeat the process by switching arms. Breathing on both sides is a great skill to master, but many swimmers prefer one side or the other. Forty years ago, coaches advocated that one needed to learn to breathe on both sides in order to be a good swimmer. Enter Grant Hackett, multiple world-record holder and Olympic champion, who breathed exclusively on the right side. Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, does the same thing. In addition, forcing the issue of breathing on both sides detracts from the needed focus on your propulsive movements. The breathing question can be addressed (if at all) once you progress far enough to work with a swim coach. TO increase DiFFicUlTy • Perform six kicks per stroke.

It is okay to point your toes slightly, but pointing too aggressively (rather than using your ankle’s natural flexion) can lead to a rigid and unproductive kick. An unproductive kick can also be caused by having your foot out of the water. Remem- ber, the goal is to exert pressure on the water; generally, therefore, only your heel should break the surface. MissTep Your kick is rigid and not propulsive. cOrrecTiOn Narrow your kick and speed it up just a bit. Remember that a splash indicates simply that the water is absorbing your energy. Think of trying to kick with your feet inside of a bucket or a basketball hoop. Rather than pointing your toes, think about curling them and keeping you knees and ankles “floppy” or loose. 67 --- Page 87 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success MissTep You go nowhere or even backward when kicking. cOrrecTiOn Check your feet and ankles. Are they pointed and rigid? Are they dorsiflexed (in an L shape)? Keep the lower part of your legs loose and your feet slightly pointed. Keeping your legs long, with little knee flexion, prevents “bicycling” or pushing at the water. Remember that the kick should come from the hip. Drills FOr kicking Kicking is critical to taking pressure off of your shoulders and engaging your core in the swimming motions. The following drills help you to practice your propulsive kick. Kicking Drill 1 kickboard This is a good drill for developing flutter-kick basics. To do it, grab the kickboard at the bottom and extend your arms. Push off of the wall and begin flutter-kicking on your front with your face in the water. Exhale slowly and drop one arm to your side while rotating. This drill is also a good way to practice your breathing; make sure

Kicking Drill 2 Vertical kicking In this drill, which requires deeper water, simply go to a treading-water position and flutter-kick. Most swimmers use their hands for balance. The purpose of the drill is to develop a propulsive kick that is symmetrical.

ten strokes and equipped with backstroke flags. The flags are placed 5 yards from the end of the pool, and most swimmers can take two or three strokes after passing beneath them before reaching the wall. 79 --- Page 99 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 4.2 Multiple-stroke backstroke. Make sure that the lane is clear and equipped with backstroke flags. Assume a bal- anced position on your back. Push off in a streamlined position with your face out of the water and begin stroking with whichever arm is most comfortable for you; take seven to ten strokes. Repeat this process several times, trying to get farther down the pool with the same number of strokes. MissTep You make a lot of splashing and thrashing movements. correcTion Many swimmers tend to rush the arm to the top of the stroke, which causes excessive splash. Remember that the goal here is to slow down the armstroke in order to have a splashless entry. MissTep You continually pull a curtain of water into your face. correcTion As you finish the stroke, rotate your hip on the same side as your stroking arm and the shoulder of your stroking arm toward the sky. This action allows you to exit the water cleanly with your thumb first; if it is done slowly enough, only a little water will drip off of your arm and hand. 80 --- Page 100 Text --- Backstroke Drills For arMsTrokes Armstroke drills help you ensure that you perform a proper entry, catch, and pull by isolating the movements so that you can focus on just one portion of the stroke.

To do it, start kicking with your hands at your sides. Simultaneously raise both arms out of the water, with your thumbs exiting first, then rotate your hands to enter the water pinkies first. Your hands should enter a little more than shoulder-width apart. Bend your elbows slightly while catching the water with your hands and pulling down toward your thighs. Make sure to finish with your palms flat against your thighs rather than down toward the pool bottom. To increase DiFFiculTy • Ball your hands into fists.

Ideally, you get a deep, effective catch and pull by using your body for rotation (figure 4.3) rather than “faking it” by finishing the stroke with your palm under your hip to force the hip over. The latter approach also forces you to lift your arm all the way back to the surface and creates extra drag. Rotation also reduces drag in another way—by reduc- ing your cross-sectional area on the water. In addition, rotation in the backstroke helps you keep your upper arms in line with your collarbones; imagine a single line extending from elbow to elbow and passing straight through your shoulders. What proper alignment through proper body rotation means for the backstroke is that you never reach behind yourself, which is a good thing since little or no power can be generated there. Reaching behind is similar to trying to push yourself up out of the water with your back to the wall and your hands on the deck. You may be able to do it if you are

which is a good thing since little or no power can be generated there. Reaching behind is similar to trying to push yourself up out of the water with your back to the wall and your hands on the deck. You may be able to do it if you are really strong, but the effort would lead to shoulder injury over the long run. When doing any of these drills or skills, make sure that the backstroke flags are in place or that you have a partner to stop you before you get to a wall. 83 --- Page 103 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 4.3 BacksTroke roTaTion Preparation 1.

Drills For roTaTion The following drills help you maintain proper body and head positioning while working on your rotation. Keep in mind that each drill may involve an overcorrec- tion of a typical flaw; when you transition back to swimming the stroke, you can smooth everything out to make each motion fluid. Rotation Drill 1 shoulder roll This position drill helps you become aware of how your hip and shoulder are con- nected for the stroke and how to use your core muscles to drive rotation. To do the drill, push off of the wall and begin kicking on your back with your hands at your sides. Once you are comfortable, roll one shoulder up to your chin, making sure that the same-side hip turns with the shoulder. Return to the neutral position on the water and repeat with the opposite shoulder. Go through several cycles of this pattern to ensure that you are comfortable with rotating on the long axis of your body without sinking.

As you can tell from the previous sections, this step involves a number of components; as a result, you need not get frustrated if you don’t get it right on the first try. Generally, the fastest backstroke swimming happens with six kicks per armstroke, in which case you are moving the lower part of your body much faster than the upper part. Try this progression to maximize your chance for success (figure 4.5). Figure 4.5 BacksTroke TiMing anD rHyTHM Preparation 1. From the wall, push off in a streamlined position and begin swimming slowly with just your arms. 2. Establish a comfortable, rhythmic breathing pattern. a Execution 1. Slowly add a flutter kick with two kicks per stroke, just using your feet to help your hips and provide balance. 2. Increase the frequency of your kicks gradually until you reach six kicks per stroke. b c 94 --- Page 114 Text --- Backstroke MissTep Your feet go really wide. correcTion This is a common problem when swimmers use their feet for balance or underreach by being out too wide on the entry.

step by entering at shoulder-width or maybe a little wider. MissTep Your kicking stops altogether, and your feet sink. correcTion Slow your kicking to a two-beat kick but try to get a few more kicks in as you get more comfortable. The backstroke is a leg-driven and hip-driven stroke, which means that rotation comes from both the core muscles and the kick. Using you core to rotate first is key; then add the kicking to synchronize your movements. Here are a couple of keys to keep in mind: Your kick should not be too big. Fluid mechanics tells us the displaced water around the body will create what is called a drag shadow. You can think of this as a moving column of water. As the vortices are shed off the sides and back of the body, this turbulent water will almost give you a bit of lift when kicking force is applied. The edge of the drag shadow is at the interface between the turbulent and nonturbulent water. Any trailing body parts extending beyond that area act to increase the cross-sectional profile of displaced water and increase drag as a resistive force exponentially. Also, make sure not to stop your stroke by overfocusing on counting your kicks; if you do have a pause in your stroke at this stage, make sure that it occurs when your arms are opposite each other. Drills For TiMing anD rHyTHM As with all strokes, good timing and rhythm are key elements of the backstroke. Unlike freestyle, in which your hands pass above your head and almost “catch up” to each other, backstroke is a hands-opposite type of stroke. That is, one hand should be entering the water as the other hand is exiting. The following drills help you develop a good timing pattern

Some theorize that it was originated by mimicking the motions of a frog, though the modern version differs somewhat in terms of the kick.

mimicking the motions of a frog, though the modern version differs somewhat in terms of the kick. In any case, it can be traced back at least to the Stone Age, when cave paintings were made in what is now western Egypt to depict people using the stroke. The breaststroke was also the only stroke used for the first recorded crossing of the Eng- lish Channel by a swimmer. There are several advantages: It is possible to breathe after every stroke, see where you are going, and use the stroke for survival and safety once you know how to do this stroke effectively. Though it is technically the slowest of the four competi- tive strokes, its subtleties and nuances make it arguably the most complex as well. Though everyone can learn to do the breaststroke—and should, since a slower vari- ant of it is essential in swimming long distances when necessary—learning to swim it fast takes a great deal of patience and time. Breaststroke and butterfly are considered “short-axis” strokes but are really tim- ing-and-rhythm strokes. Granted, you do rotate on a shorter axis (i.e., through the chest, laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes: • Good body position • Effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Kicking rhythm • Effective breathing • Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these components, you are well on your way to an effective breaststroke. The breaststroke is the only one of the four competitive strokes that derives its propulsive force equally from the pull and the kick; therefore, you should give equal attention to both elements. This double focus is one factor that makes the

than 12 inches (30 cm) apart. 5 points: You can go 25 yards in 15 or more kicks • You can go 25 yards on your front with ease. 7 points: You can go 25 yards in fewer than 15 kicks. The pull The second propulsive element of the breaststroke is the pull (figure 5.2). Unlike free- style and backstroke, each of these movements is independent of the other; therefore, timing is crucial. First, focus on developing a really good breaststroke catch-and-pull phase. The difference is that the hands are not stacked one on top of the other as in the preceding skill. The catch and the pull are two parts of the same motion. The release from the pull position is achieved by bringing the elbows together under the body while simultaneously moving the hands forward. Here is an effective trick for thinking about these movements together. Imagine that you are scraping cake batter out of a bowl with your pinkie fingers, then pushing it to someone else. Your hands accelerate throughout the catch-and-pull phase until reaching the neutral position again. Your hands should never go past your shoulders. If they do, you will have to bring them forward, making a propulsive movement in a direction opposite of the way you are swimming. You will then have to start again after this motion makes you stop, thus requiring more energy to accelerate. Figure 5.2 BreasTsTroke pull Preparation 1. Make sure that you have enough space to perform the drill. 2.

Initiate the catch movement by sweeping your hands out slightly past your shoul- ders while pitching your fin- gers down toward the pool bottom. 2. Your torso and arms should make almost a Y shape when viewed from the top. As your fingers pitch down, your elbows bend slightly to get your forearms into a more b vertical position and put additional pressure on the water. 3. Before your hands pass your elbows in the elbow-up-and- hand-down position, stop putting pressure on the water. 4. Collapse your elbows together as your hands push forward. 5. Make sure that your hands accelerate through the move- ment back to the streamlined position. c d 105 --- Page 125 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success MissTep You pull too wide with your elbows straight and your palms out. correcTion Remember to pitch your fingers down and catch the water. Sweep out as if using a sculling motion, but here the goal is to wrap your fingers down and use your palm to put pressure on the water. MissTep Your hands come past your shoulders. correcTion Think of releasing the water earlier or even touching your elbows together under your chest. Doing so helps ensure that your hands do not come past your shoulders on the pull. Drills for BreasTsTroke pull The pull in the breaststroke is just as important as the kick—and more important for some swimmers who are not as good at the kick portion. To develop an effective pull, it is helpful to isolate this part of the overall stroke. More specifically, the pitch of your hand and your

to produce an undulating motion. 115 --- Page 135 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success As you complete the undulating and kicking motion, pitch your fingers down toward the bottom of the pool and bend at the elbows in a motion similar to that of pushing yourself up out of the pool. Once your hands and forearms are close to verti- cal, push back while accelerating your hands and arms. The propulsive force of your hands and forearms—along with a slight forward push of your chin—causes you to rise out of the water high enough to get a breath. The last element involves acceleration of your hands past your hips and out of the water. With your head and shoulders out of the water, a forceful movement of your hands at the finish allows you to recover your arms in a straight fashion. The arms remain straight rather than bent over and parallel to the surface of the water. The entry of your hands and arms should be above your head in front of your shoulders, if not a little wider, thus returning you to your original neutral position to begin the next stroke cycle. You will practice each of these elements in the following sections, which include drills to help you master each element and culminate in a discussion of putting it all together. Dolphin KicK Unlike the flutter kick, the dolphin kick derives its power from the middle part of your core—from the lower part of your rib cage down through your pelvis. In addi- tion, your legs stay together the whole time. The basic motion involves driving your hips back and forth with the strong muscles of your core and using your legs merely to finish off the kick. Your legs should be long and loose; let

Flex your wrists and point your fingers down toward the bottom of the pool. 2. As you do so, your elbows rotate out and bend, creat- ing a good catch and getting much of the surface area of your hands and forearms close to vertical and thus b perpendicular to the direc- tion in which you want to go. 3. The pull is straight back, and the pitch of your hands changes to keep them ver- tical for longer during the stroke. 4. Finish by accelerating your hands through the end of the stroke. c d 125 --- Page 145 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Drills For BuTTerFlY arM MoVeMenT When you watch accomplished butterfly swimmers, you see the recovery, but the real magic happens underwater. That is where the positioning of the hands, elbows, forearms, and shoulders really comes into play. When doing the following drills, remember that you are not pushing down but pulling forward. Butterfly Arm Movement Drill 1 Wall press This drill teaches you the correct catch and pull through the armstroke. To per- form the drill, get in the pool in water that is over your head. Place your hands at least shoulder-width apart on the pool deck and submerge until your arms are fully extended.

is required to bring the arms and hands back to the forward position. The key is to finish the stroke fast and feather the hands so that they exit the water smoothly, pinkies out first. If the stroke is finished with an acceleration, the forward movement of the arms requires less effort. It should be done in the same position: little fingers up, thumbs down, and forearms and upper arms parallel to the water. The specifics of how the hands enter the water are matters of style. Some swimmers do it thumb first, whereas others rotate the wrists before entry. Regardless of style, one must ensure that the fingers are down as described in the catch-and-pull phase. Therefore, if you use the thumbs-first option, make sure to rotate your fingers and hands to be perpendicular to the direction in which you are traveling. 127 --- Page 147 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 6.7 BuTTerFlY arM recoVerY Preparation 1.

If this movement is done with great force, your hands and arms will recover almost by themselves. If you find yourself struggling to get your hands out of the water, check your positioning and practice the following drills. Butterfly Arm Recovery Drill 1 Dolphin Dive This classic drill helps you get used to the undulating motion and provides buoyant force support while you coordinate the over-the-water recovery. To perform it, stand in waist-deep water with your hands at your sides, then bend at the waist so that your chest is in the water but your shoulders are out. Your chin should touch the water as you look at a spot 8 to 10 inches (20-25 cm) in front of your face. Next, rotate your hands—so that your pinkies are up and your thumbs down— and sweep them forward over the water; near the beginning of the movement, put your face in the water. Now place your hands in the water in front of your shoulders or slightly wider. Push yourself forward off of the bottom and stretch out on the water while pushing your chest and your hips down toward the

near the beginning of the movement, put your face in the water. Now place your hands in the water in front of your shoulders or slightly wider. Push yourself forward off of the bottom and stretch out on the water while pushing your chest and your hips down toward the bottom. This is the same kicking motion described earlier. Pull yourself forward and, when your hands reach your hips, stop and stand up. Repeating this drill causes an undulating motion that serves as the basis for your stroke and allows you time to isolate the recovery por- tion of the stroke.

In freestyle swimming, simply push your chin forward. Please note that you should not necessarily lift your head; instead, bring your chin forward, which causes you to rise to the surface gradually. In contrast, lifting your head causes you to become more vertical, thus losing momen- tum and slowing down. Figure 7.3 Open Turn phase 3: BreakOuT Preparation 1.

Many pools either restrict diving or are not deep enough for diving at all. Check with the lifeguard or your instructor to ensure that this particular activity is appropriate at your pool. Depth requirements vary from governing body to governing body, but all require at least 4.5 feet (~1.4 m); if you are a novice, then even deeper is better. And again, before attempting any dive start, check with the facility or safety staff—the risk of head or neck injury during a dive start is much greater in shallow water. Although many people know how to dive, the competitive dive start is a little different from just diving in to get wet on a hot day. Even if you are an experienced swimmer, it is good to have a refresher in the elements of diving. 161 --- Page 181 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success A dive start is an attempt to maximize velocity and minimize drag at the start of a contest. Since all of our strokes are headfirst, diving in headfirst (or rather hands first) prevents any waste of energy from changing position. Ideally, a dive start involves very little vertical content, thus directing the explosive movement down the length of the pool. The transition into the water consists of angling down toward the water, leading with the hands, and following with the rest of the body at an ideal angle for achieving the best depth—not too much and not too little. The following progression gets you used to the proper entry position. KneelIng DIve The first part of the progression is the kneeling dive (figure 8.1). During this part, many swimmers place a towel on the deck to protect their knees. Repeat the process several times before moving on; each time, try to enter through the “hole”

The difference in the track start is the start position. In this position, one foot is forward and the other is back, just like track athletes use for their starts. During the 1960s and 1970s, it was used by some U.S. collegiate swimmers, and in the 1980s a few U.S. swimmers became the first to use it in international competition. They were disqualified, but a chal- lenge to the ruling led to the conclusion that regulations did not require both feet to be at the front of the starting blocks. By the 1990s, the technique had become more widespread, and it is now the standard starting technique for most swimmers. It can

the standing jump drill, it is time to work on the entry. Your entry is crucial for maintaining the power that you generate off of the block. If you go too shallow, you belly flop; if your angle is too severe, you go to the bottom of the pool. On the other hand, the proper angle of entry—along with a good streamline— gets you down the pool with the most efficiency and speed. Entry Drill Streamline only This drill isolates the entry portion of the start. It is performed by standing on the block, getting into the take-your-mark position, performing the push, and going as far as you can with no movement—just a streamline. The drill not only maximizes your push force but also ensures that you make a good entry and carry as much momentum as possible into the water.

Experiment to find out which head and body positions produce the best streamline for you while keeping you underwa- ter for the correct amount of streamline. Since you are faceup, it is likely that water will go up your nose unless you breathe out slowly. Alternatively, some swimmers opt for a nose clip. 173 --- Page 193 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 8.5 baCKStroKe Curl Start Set 1. Enter the water feetfirst and face the wall. 2.

Rather than using just your forefeet or toes, position your feet closer to the sur- face of the water and flatter on the wall. a 4. Your hands should be on the grab bar or deck. In the set position, keep your hips away from the wall and curl your back and shoulders toward the block. Push 1. Your upper body and shoulders must be moving down the pool before your feet push. As a result, you must push away from the grab bars and throw your hands either over your head or out to the side to bring them to the streamlined position. b 2.

many respects to the curl start. It differs mainly in the set, wherein the hips are closer to the wall and the shoulders are farther down the pool. Next comes the push, for which the key is timing. The motion should involve pointing your fingers down toward the bottom of the pool over your head. The result should be almost a back dive. The most efficient swimmers follow an arc and their feet go from under the water to out of the water and then back through the same hole that the upper body goes through. Strong swimmers get the entire body out of the water at some point and basically go through the same hole as the hands. Depth on the entry differs from that of the chest-down strokes. In the backstroke, the streamline and dolphin kick are important elements. In fact, one of the fastest recorded backstroke swims was done mostly on an underwater streamline with a dolphin kick. With this in mind, if you are a good dolphin kicker, it works to your advantage to go deeper and longer on the entry. Experiment to find out which head and body positions produce the best streamline for you while keeping you underwa- ter for the correct amount of streamline. To prevent water from entering your nose during this phase, breathe out slowly or use a nose clip. 177 --- Page 197 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 8.6 Flat-baCK Start Set 1.

Survival SWimming Sidestroke, though not a competitive stroke, is a great stroke to master for open-water and survival swimming. It allows you to have your face out of the water to breathe and uses a powerful scissorlike kick. Like breaststroke, it derives propulsion almost equally from armstroking and kicking. As the name implies, sidestroke is done on the side; one shoulder and arm are toward the bottom of the pool, and the other shoulder is out of the water with the majority of the arm submerged. As with the other strokes discussed in this book, the best way to master the sidestroke is to master its individual elements separately and then put them all together. Sidestroke Kicking The sidestroke employs a scissor kick (figure 9.7), which differs from the flutter kick in that the legs are wide apart and the swimmer is on his or her side. To perform the scis- sor kick, bring the leg that is closer to the surface forward by drawing the knee toward your chest. The leg that is closer to the bottom of the pool extends back so

of which you are capable. Goal SettinG Goal setting is an important part of any healthy lifestyle, whether it is done for fit- ness, recreation, or competition. Regardless of what area of life you are addressing, goal setting gives you direction and focus. It helps shape your decision making, not just about how you spend your exercise time but also about other aspects of your life, such as what you eat and drink and how much rest you get. If you are interested in swimming purely as a way to stay fit or get fit, then you may think that goal setting is unimportant in this area of your life. That is, however, far from true. Fitness goals do tend to take on different characteristics than compet- itive goals, but they are goals nonetheless. Here are just a few examples of fitness goals: lowering your heart rate, losing weight, feeling better, making your clothes fit better, and cross-training. 215 --- Page 235 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Swimming is also used by athletes from other sports who want to supplement their usual routine or rehab an injury. In fact, there is a whole branch of sports med- icine and rehab that use aquatics as a way of getting people back into athletics—or just back into their normal pattern of life. In addition, more and more physicians are prescribing exercise as a pathway to better health on all levels. For recreational swimmers, goals are a little easier to quantify, since they often involve either distance or time or both. Many recreational swimmers are also seeking to do a first triathlon or perhaps just become able to swim a certain distance or swim for a certain amount of time. These swimmers need to set a goal to get them out of
