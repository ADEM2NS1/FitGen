work in tandem to make it possible to perform tasks as simple as putting on goggles and as lofty as winning Olympic gold. Yet, when we see a fantastic swimmer moving through the water with grace and speed, we don’t associate their speed with muscular strength. Instead we associate it with skill. We notice their skill at reducing drag and maintaining a streamlined body shape. We notice their skill at “feeling” the water and using it to their advantage. We notice their skill at coordinating stroke actions that together produce fluid forward motion. In fact, it is widely accepted that swimming is not a matter of muscling your way through the water. Swimmers have to know how to swim! Still, it is puzzling to see swimmers with such picture-perfect strokes that they could star in a video on stroke technique who, when the time comes to swim fast, are unable to generate speed. Then there are swimmers with equally developed stroke technique who move through the water with such velocity that they appear to be wearing invisible flippers. So, what is the difference? What makes one swimmer able to achieve speed in the water but another swimmer unable to? The main difference is strength. The mechanics of swimming are not based on technique alone but also on the application of force and power. When we swim, our muscles are engaged in an integrated sequence of actions to both exert resistance on the water and to balance and stabilize our bodies so that forward motion is realized. In this way, when two swimmers, both with solid stroke technique, are swimming side by side, the stronger swimmer will be faster. Thus, that fantastic swimmer, who looks like poetry in motion, is in actuality muscling his way through the water! By adding strength

so that forward motion is realized. In this way, when two swimmers, both with solid stroke technique, are swimming side by side, the stronger swimmer will be faster. Thus, that fantastic swimmer, who looks like poetry in motion, is in actuality muscling his way through the water! By adding strength to skill, faster swimming is possible. As the title of this book suggests, strength training for swimming is a very specialized activity. The specific audience and the specific goal of this book 7 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 7 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 10 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming lead us to the logical conclusion that swimming strength is not developed very well through a general approach to strength training. Building useable strength for swimming requires attention to more than making the muscles strong. It requires orientation toward specific aspects of strength. It requires simulation of swimming directionality and tempo. Above all, it requires attention to training multi-muscle movements, like those that make up swimming. General strength training may produce some positive results in a hit or miss fashion, but it can also produce bulk and fatigue that can interfere with swimming. To make sure that strength work produces the intended results for swimmers, it must be designed and structured with swimming in mind. To illustrate this point, I would like to share a story that a swimmer recounted with me about the last year of his long swimming career. He told me that he had been a dedicated swimmer, with twelve years of training and competition experience under his belt. He had enviable technique, and even more enviable endurance. Knocking off 10 x 200 on the 2:30, and swimming double workouts five days a week, was no problem. He was, in fact, a coaches’ ideal of self-motivation, and a

with twelve years of training and competition experience under his belt. He had enviable technique, and even more enviable endurance. Knocking off 10 x 200 on the 2:30, and swimming double workouts five days a week, was no problem. He was, in fact, a coaches’ ideal of self-motivation, and a role model of good work ethic to the rest of his team. He did it all because he dreamed of going to the Olympics. It was more than a dream though; it was a goal, and at the age of 18, he was determined to make the Olympic team. After months of intense training, he found himself at a plateau and decided to supplement his swimming with weights. In addition to swimming over 80,000 each week, he also went to the gym and lifted weights, understanding that more strength would benefit his swimming speed. He developed a routine of exercises from those he observed other people at the gym doing regularly, including all the standard body building lifts. He did bench press, military press and French curls by the dozens. He got to the point that he could lift impressive amounts of weight with little effort. He continued this routine diligently for several months, building a large and well-defined upper body. As the last meet of the season approached, he found himself feeling quite tired, and his test swims were not outstanding, showing a sluggish tempo and higher stroke count than desirable. Still, going into the competition, he maintained his confidence. He believed that because he had worked as hard as he could both in and out of the water, he would make a swimming breakthrough. But after his race, he was stunned to have made no progress at all. In fact, he had clocked a time that he achieved

confidence. He believed that because he had worked as hard as he could both in and out of the water, he would make a swimming breakthrough. But after his race, he was stunned to have made no progress at all. In fact, he had clocked a time that he achieved two years before. Disappointed that all of his dedication and training had made no impact, he became disheartened and soon lost interest in swimming, allowing his dream to slip away. 8 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 8 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 11 Text --- Introduction This sad story is all too common. A swimmer with amazing work ethic and goal-oriented drive gets into a cycle of extreme over-training and non- specific, non-progressive strength training. Despite red flags – including plateau, fatigue, and reduced flexibility – that foretell poor race results, the swimmer keeps training and fails to reach the goal. Coaches and swimmers: This is preventable! This book addresses strength training as a means to achieve more speed in the water, rather than simply a means to become stronger. Emphasis is placed on both the underlying concepts and crucial details of building strength that transfers to swimming. Readers will explore how to structure a strength training program that will work with the swimming routine. Readers will learn about the importance of individualizing training to match a swimmer’s stage of development, level of experience, and swimming specialty. Readers will discover what kinds of activities build usable strength in the water. At the end of the book, a series of strength training routines and circuits are included for each stage of development.

Before skipping right to that chapter, please take time to read the rest of the book first so you will have the background information that will prepare you to get the best results possible. Here is to reaching your swimming dreams! 9 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 9 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 12 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming 10 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 10 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 13 Text --- What Makes Swimmers Fast? 1 WHAT MAKES SWIMMERS FAST? The common goal in competitive swimming is to swim faster and, to a large extent, training is the means to that objective. The evolution of our sport has been marked by countless theories of training, based on emerging science, past results and intuition. Determined swimmers pair with inspired coaches in search of the perfect formula for attaining swimming speed. Training methods using more volume, or less volume but more intensity both in and out of the water, diets with more protein or less protein, and various pre-competition rituals have been designed with the single purpose of defying speed barriers. And swimming times keep dropping, as many of these strategies have resulted in incredible success for individual swimmers. But the fact is no single training formula has worked across the board. Some swimmers do better swimming twice a day, while others only once. Some swimmers will benefit from weight training, while others will get more out of a self-resistance program. Some swimmers can eat anything, anytime, but some have to carefully watch their calorie intake. Some swimmers race better practicing all the way up to the day before the meet, but others need several days, or even weeks of rest. We have come to

more out of a self-resistance program. Some swimmers can eat anything, anytime, but some have to carefully watch their calorie intake. Some swimmers race better practicing all the way up to the day before the meet, but others need several days, or even weeks of rest. We have come to understand that a uniform training strategy for competitive swimming is both ineffective and unrealistic. Differences in stage of development, conditioning and skill level, body type, rate of recovery, and swimming specialty reveal that an individualized approach to training yields the best results. While there is no single alchemy, certain training principles have endured and gained acceptance as integral elements in the quest for swimming speed. 11 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 11 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 14 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming SWIMMING The main element in a swimmer’s training, at every stage of his or her career, must be swimming. Without frequent and ample time in the water, even the best athlete will not be prepared to swim fast because he will not be prepared to swim well. Only time in the water enables a swimmer to develop the swimming technique that leads to the essential ability to “feel” the water. Only time in the water teaches a swimmer to eliminate drag and be more “fishlike.” Only time in the water gives a swimmer the experience of coordinating stroke actions and accessing the best sequence of muscles to accomplish fluid forward motion. Only time in the water enables a swimmer to practice stroke economy, balance and stability in the aquatic environment. There is no substitute for time in the water. To be a faster swimmer, one first has to be a good swimmer. ATHLETIC BASE The saying goes, “better athletes make better swimmers.” There is no way around it.

swimmer to practice stroke economy, balance and stability in the aquatic environment. There is no substitute for time in the water. To be a faster swimmer, one first has to be a good swimmer. ATHLETIC BASE The saying goes, “better athletes make better swimmers.” There is no way around it. Swimming is not a sport that gives immediate gratification. When a person comes into competitive swimming without a base of athleticism, a great deal of time and energy must be devoted to building that base, to prepare the person to take on the rigors of training for competitive swimming. In contrast, when these qualities are already present, a swimmer is able to excel faster. A swimmer who comes into swimming with an athletic base in place is able to concentrate on developing solid swimming skills, gaining swimming experience, and swimming fast! 12 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 12 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 15 Text --- What Makes Swimmers Fast? Athleticism is defined in many ways. For the purposes of this book, we will measure athleticism in the following terms: 1) Cardiovascular fitness — ability of the body to transport and utilize oxygen 2) Flexibility — range of motion 3) Coordination — integrating movements into unified effective effort 4) Strength — power, force, explosiveness and stability against resistance An active lifestyle beginning in childhood that includes casual and organized activities that involve running, jumping, climbing and balancing builds overall athletic ability. STRENGTH TRAINING When analyzing the qualities of athleticism that are most developed by swimmers, we see that, without a doubt, competitive swimming provides some of the best cardiovascular fitness of any sport. The full body requirements and repetitive nature of our sport promotes high levels of aerobic capacity and cardiovascular efficiency, much like runners and cyclists possess, but with the added requirement

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
kinetic chain. And, in what other sport does the athlete propel himself or herself at full speed toward a wall, then tuck and reverse directions without slowing down? Finally, we come to strength, the final measure of athletic condition. As we compare the strength developed by swimmers with the strength developed by other athletes, it is clear that swimmers do not develop the same degree of musculature as many other athletes. For example, football players and weightlifters develop more muscle bulk than swimmers in order to succeed in their sports. But since swimming does not have the same strength requirements as football and weightlifting, should we be concerned with strength levels in swimming? The answer is yes! While swimmers do not need muscle size to excel, they do need muscle strength. There are four types of strength that swimmers should be concerned with: 14 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 14 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 17 Text --- What Makes Swimmers Fast? FORCE Force is the maximum amount of resistance that can be applied. In the case of swimming, force refers to the maximum resistance that can be applied to the water, in one stroke, from the beginning of the catch through the end of the underwater stroke, accelerating from beginning to end. More deliverable force improves a swimmer’s distance per stroke, ultimately producing more potential for speed. POWER Power is the ability to maintain force over time. In swimming, power is required to do the series of strokes it takes to complete any single lap or distance in the pool. A swimmer who is able to keep a higher percentage of force throughout his or her race all the way to the end with less fatigue is able to maintain more even splits, and therefore produce a faster overall time. EXPLOSIVENESS Explosiveness

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
any single lap or distance in the pool. A swimmer who is able to keep a higher percentage of force throughout his or her race all the way to the end with less fatigue is able to maintain more even splits, and therefore produce a faster overall time. EXPLOSIVENESS Explosiveness is the ability to recruit a burst of force. In swimming, explosiveness is beneficial for fast starts, turns and sprinting. A swimmer with good explosive strength is quick off the blocks and has turns that set him or her apart from the field. Explosiveness is also the basis of sprinting. However, it should be pointed out that swimming even the shortest race, with its 20 to 30-second average time span, takes more than just explosiveness, it also takes power and force to sprint well. STABILITY Stability refers to one’s ability to balance and control movements from within the body. In swimming, we must be able to create and maintain integrity in motion, and do so without the support of the ground. The ability to stabilize oneself is crucial to producing forward motion while floating. A swimmer with good stability is able to generate power from the center of the body and send it upward to the arms and downward to the legs in a continual chain reaction to generate speed. A carefully designed strength training program enhances a swimmer’s water training, dramatically enriching its value. In addition to swimming, strength training that addresses all four kinds of strength should be considered an essential part of a swimmer’s long-term training. 15 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 15 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 18 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming HOW LAND-BASED STRENGTH TRAINING ENCOURAGES SWIMMING SPEED Resistance is the basis of all strength building.

considered an essential part of a swimmer’s long-term training. 15 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 15 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 18 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming HOW LAND-BASED STRENGTH TRAINING ENCOURAGES SWIMMING SPEED Resistance is the basis of all strength building. Although there are some effective ways of increasing resistance during swimming, including hand paddles, tethered swimming, drag suits and towing chutes and pails, the reality is that none of these methods can deliver the results in terms of building strength that can be achieved on land. With more gravitational effect on land than in the water, more load is possible. Strategic strength training that develops the force required to resist a load on land builds the swimmer’s ability to apply more force to the underwater stroke, both in the catch and the acceleration of the arm toward the finish, thus moving his or her body farther and faster per stroke with less fatigue. In addition to this, self-stabilization, especially in the horizontal swimming position, is much more challenging out of the water. By learning to maintain body position against gravity on land, a swimmer will develop a stronger foundation to swim from. With less resistance in the air than in the water, the tempo of movements can be quicker on land. Strategic strength training that develops the power to repeatedly move a load through the air gives the swimmer more strength to overcome the thickness of the water. It also brings an increased and sustainable tempo to his or her swimming stroke. In addition, practicing true explosive actions on land gives a swimmer quicker reaction time to his or her starts, more speed off the walls in turns, and a solid base for sprinting. By making use of gravity to increase load, and by making use of the “thin”

her swimming stroke. In addition, practicing true explosive actions on land gives a swimmer quicker reaction time to his or her starts, more speed off the walls in turns, and a solid base for sprinting. By making use of gravity to increase load, and by making use of the “thin” environment of the air to increase rate, strength is developed better and faster on land than it would be in the water. Strength training on land increases force potential, improves core stability, builds deliverable power, and develops explosiveness, all of which positively encourage more speed and decrease fatigue in the water. A swimmer who uses the ideal environment to build strength brings an advantage back to the ideal environment for swimming. 16 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 16 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 19 Text --- What Makes Swimmers Fast? WHY SWIMMING IS NOT ENOUGH In the aquatic environment, resistance and gravity provide both challenges and advantages. These challenges make strength the most difficult athletic quality to develop through water training alone. The advantages make strength the least noticeable athletic quality in swimmers. Swimmers, in fact, are often are so developed in terms of fitness, flexibility and coordination that strength is overlooked. Swimmers spend a great deal of time learning the essential skill of overcoming the resistance of the water. We search for the best body position so we will slide through the water without interrupting it, avoiding drag that will slow us down, much like an airplane that is designed to cut through the air with the least resistance. But in addition to learning to treat the water like air, we must also learn to treat it like rock. We must learn to use the resistance of the water to our advantage. We must be able to grab hold of it, like

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
through the air with the least resistance. But in addition to learning to treat the water like air, we must also learn to treat it like rock. We must learn to use the resistance of the water to our advantage. We must be able to grab hold of it, like it was solid, anchoring our hand at a point in front of us, then move our body past that point, similar to a rock climber who grasps the rock at a point above, then lifts his or her body beyond that point. Applying resistance to the water takes strength, and just like a more streamlined swimmer has an advantage, a stronger swimmer also has an advantage. But training in the water limits our ability to develop strength in two ways. First, the thickness of the water makes the rate of each motion to advance the body slower than it would on land. Second, in the reduced gravity environment of the water, the swimmer’s body weight is lighter, which produces less load for the swimmer to move. The obvious question that arises is: if our medium is water, why should we be concerned with moving at the rate we could on land, or being able to move a larger load than we need to in the water? The answer is, that when we are able to recruit more force, power, explosiveness and stability, in combination with using good swimming skills, we are able to achieve more speed in the water. Land-based strength training builds useable strength for swimmers. A training routine that combines swimming and strength work on land gives swimmers an edge over water-based training alone. 17 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 17 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 20 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming MORE BENEFITS OF STRENGTH TRAINING While the

training is the management of training time. Limitations on water time, as well as limits on the productive swimming a person can be expected to do in one session can lead to training content deficiencies. As we try to include every training element into our limited water time, we may end up short on every element. By supplementing water training with additional time dedicated to land-based strength work, more value can be achieved in with the overall training routine. Precious water time can be used to practice solid technique, including stroke coordination, the elimination of drag, refining “feel” for the water, and to experience swimming economically at any speed. Land work can be used to develop the full spectrum of swimming-specific strength, where it is developed most efficiently. NEW FEEDBACK Strength training also adds a new dimension of feedback to a swimmer’s routine. It is common for swimmers to become so accustomed to swimming that they forget to pay attention to the mechanics of what they are doing in the water. Land-based strength training provides a new way to “connect” with the physical actions of the sport. In addition, swimmers can observe improvement in strength as they adapt to the workload. More repetitions, more resistance, and faster tempo achieved over time on land give a swimmer concrete feedback that they are improving, thereby building confidence and motivation. 19 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 19 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 22 Text --- 20 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 20 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 23 Text --- Making Strength Training Count 2 MAKING STRENGTH TRAINING COUNT The ultimate effectiveness of a strength training program is measured in terms of what is accomplished in the pool.

--- Making Strength Training Count 2 MAKING STRENGTH TRAINING COUNT The ultimate effectiveness of a strength training program is measured in terms of what is accomplished in the pool. There must be positive results. To make sure this happens, the strength training program should be designed and redesigned to meet that objective. It should evolve as the swimmer’s strength evolves and consider the individual swimmer’s changing needs. This means that careful observation and monitoring must be an essential element of the program. By evaluating results, or lack of results, we can tailor the program to work better or take positive steps to redirect efforts. Ongoing evaluation should consider a number of issues, as outlined below. TRANSFERABILITY The key to a successful strength training program is that every activity must be transferable to swimming speed. If it doesn’t transfer, then it is a waste of time, or worse, it could even hinder faster swimming. Every strength training exercise can make a swimmer tired, but once the swimmer recovers, does the new strength improve his or her swimming speed? In order to get strength work to transfer to swimming speed, it is important to perform activities that use swimming-like movement and target major swimming-specific muscle groups that together produce that movement, including both visible and underlying muscles. We must strengthen the muscles that move us forward as well as those that stabilize us. It is important to consider directionality when applying resistance on land. Our primary effort should be focused in simulating the direction of swimming. It is also important to mimic swimming tempo as much as possible. A tempo slower than swimming tempo will not transfer to faster speed in the water. 21 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 21 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 24 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Finally, at

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
and rest. When adaptation is allowed to occur in this way, it is important that the program evolve, providing new challenges to swimmers as they adapt. Such challenges can take the form of doing the same exercise with more load, more repetitions, or faster repetitions depending on the objective. Or a swimmer could be asked to perform a more complex action than before. Simply repeating the same stress that the swimmer has already adapted to will not increase strength. Each time a swimmer adapts, new demands must be introduced. By using this kind of progression, a swimmer will develop strength more steadily through his or her career. 22 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 22 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 25 Text --- Making Strength Training Count There is no hard and fast timeline for adaptation. Just as with swimming, strength training does not produce immediate results. Patience is required. A conservative approach, using periodic test sets once a month to gauge adaptation, should determine when new challenges should be presented. ORIENTATION When exposed to resistance, muscle fibers adapt and develop, resulting in more strength. The kind of muscle fiber we develop depends on the amount, duration and rate of the resistance. Strength training can develop either slow or fast twitch muscle fiber. Slow twitch muscle fiber is associated with endurance and stamina. Strength training that focuses on developing power builds slow twitch muscle. Slow twitch muscle fiber enables us to do continuous or repetitive movements over a period of time. Fast twitch muscle fiber is associated with speed and agility. Strength training that focuses on developing force and explosiveness builds fast twitch muscle. Fast twitch muscle fiber enables us to sprint and produce bursts of acceleration. That being said, it is important to remember that in swimming, every event (no matter how short

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
fiber is associated with speed and agility. Strength training that focuses on developing force and explosiveness builds fast twitch muscle. Fast twitch muscle fiber enables us to sprint and produce bursts of acceleration. That being said, it is important to remember that in swimming, every event (no matter how short or how long) benefits from both slow and fast twitch muscle strength. While fast twitch muscle fiber is most important for sprinting, even the shortest swimming event requires a number of repetitions of a stroke to be performed over time. Therefore, some slow twitch fiber is also important for the sprinter to have a strong finish. Likewise, while slow twitch is most important for long distance swimming, some fast twitch muscle is essential for the distance swimmer to develop the force and explosive strength that would allow him or her to do quicker starts and all those turns. Swimming is an activity that builds slow twitch muscle very well. However, not a great deal of fast twitch muscle is built by swimming. This leads some to conclude that the orientation of a strength training program for swimmers should focus on slow twitch development because it is the kind of strength 23 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 23 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 26 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming that swimmers use most. But that is only half of the picture. The reason swimmers engage in land-based strength training is to build more strength than they can achieve in the water. If the goal of strength training is more speed then our efforts should address building fast twitch muscle fiber, the type of muscle fiber associated with speed. The most effective strength training program, oriented toward the goal of more speed, must actively address fast twitch muscle development in addition to supplementing

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
the goal of strength training is more speed then our efforts should address building fast twitch muscle fiber, the type of muscle fiber associated with speed. The most effective strength training program, oriented toward the goal of more speed, must actively address fast twitch muscle development in addition to supplementing the slow twitch work we already get in the pool and need to swim stroke after stroke. Every individual naturally possesses either more slow twitch muscle or more fast twitch muscle that helps determine what activities they will favor. In swimming, those with more natural slow twitch muscle tend to excel in long distance events and seem to prefer them, while those with more natural fast twitch muscle tend to excel in the sprint events and seem to like them more. Training, however, can change this. While people are born with a predisposition for endurance or speed, the amount of total muscle fiber responsible for natural ability is very small. In fact, the majority of muscle fiber in the human body is neither fast nor slow twitch. It is convertible, or responsive, to training. Convertible muscle fiber can be trained to work as fast twitch or slow twitch. This wealth of convertible muscle fiber suggests some interesting possibilities. Would a natural sprinter be able to develop more slow twitch muscle fiber and excel at long distances as well? Would a natural distance swimmer be able to develop more fast twitch muscle and also excel at the sprint events? Certainly the presence of convertible muscle fiber offers swimmers the opportunity to train for more versatility. However, at some point in a swimmer’s career, success in certain events leads that swimmer to narrow his or her focus a bit. At that point, training too should be focused toward particular specialties. Training equally

presence of convertible muscle fiber offers swimmers the opportunity to train for more versatility. However, at some point in a swimmer’s career, success in certain events leads that swimmer to narrow his or her focus a bit. At that point, training too should be focused toward particular specialties. Training equally for all distances could reduce the results at either extreme. Some sprinters can develop a great deal of bulk, resulting in more resistance and density in the water, in addition to less flexibility that would hinder long distance performance. Conversely, the stroke tempo of most distance swimmers is too slow to achieve great sprinting success. By training for all distances, a swimmer could expect to become pretty fast across the board, but not very fast at any one event. By specializing, a swimmer maximizes performance by training convertible muscle fiber to enhance natural skills. 24 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 24 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 27 Text --- Making Strength Training Count VARIATION The concept of alternating stress and rest suggests that a swimmer should not do strength training on a daily basis. Actually, for some swimmers, a well-designed strength training program can be done on sequential days, although it is advisable to incorporate one to two days off per week for “pure” rest. The design of a successful daily program accomplishes the stress and rest model by having the swimmer perform upper body exercises on one day and lower body exercises the next day. On the upper body work day, the lower body rests, and on the lower body work day, the upper body rests. Building in variation in training also keeps a swimmer sharp, both mentally and physically. A creatively designed program uses a diverse array of exercises to meet each training objective. For instance, if the objective is explosiveness,

lower body rests, and on the lower body work day, the upper body rests. Building in variation in training also keeps a swimmer sharp, both mentally and physically. A creatively designed program uses a diverse array of exercises to meet each training objective. For instance, if the objective is explosiveness, a swimmer could be given leaps for height, 15-yard running sprints, or a speed jump rope activity. If the objective is core stability, a swimmer could be given a two-minute plank, a series of “V” ups, or some “left rights” with a medicine ball. If the objective is power, a swimmer could be given fifteen minutes of rowing, some stretch cord work, or as many dips as they can do in a minute. This sort of variation in training adds interest and can boost a swimmer’s coordination, as he or she is required to accomplish new and different actions with the same muscles groups. The crucial point is that every exercise that is added to the mix must bring the swimmer closer to the objective. 25 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 25 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 28 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Variation also makes things fun. Swimmers spend a lot of time with their faces in the water, alone with their thoughts, looking at the black line on the bottom of the pool. A good variety of land-based strength training gives swimmers the opportunity to socialize while they train, laugh together as they observe each other’s initially awkward efforts, and motivate each other as they master the coordination of a new exercise. OVER-TRAINING In general, swimmers have a great work ethic. The combination of mental toughness and a highly developed fitness level enables them to keep working when they are tired. While, in many ways, this is an admirable

and motivate each other as they master the coordination of a new exercise. OVER-TRAINING In general, swimmers have a great work ethic. The combination of mental toughness and a highly developed fitness level enables them to keep working when they are tired. While, in many ways, this is an admirable trait, it also leaves swimmers vulnerable to over-training. The danger of over- training becomes a real concern especially when strength training is added to a swimmer’s routine. It is important to remember that the main objective of strength training is to enable a swimmer to produce more speed in the pool. If strength training is leaving a swimmer continually too tired to swim well, he or she is probably over-training. 26 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 26 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 29 Text --- Making Strength Training Count Signs of over-training include continual early fatigue in swim practice, slow tempo, poor race results, plateau, slow adaptation, insomnia, impatience, prolonged grumpiness and lack of interest. Over-training should be distinguished from the temporary fatigue associated with an intense cycle of training that is followed by a planned cycle of rest, although it may be hard to tell the difference. However, a swimmer who is temporarily fatigued will respond positively to rest and perform better after resting. A swimmer who is over-trained will not show much speed improvement after rest because he has not successfully adapted along the way. The best way to deal with over-training is to make sure it doesn’t happen. Careful and ongoing monitoring of progress is required. This is the responsibility of the coach because often the swimmer will just keep working, focused on the motto he or she has heard throughout his or her swimming career, “If you want to be fast, you have to work hard.” If a swimmer

ongoing monitoring of progress is required. This is the responsibility of the coach because often the swimmer will just keep working, focused on the motto he or she has heard throughout his or her swimming career, “If you want to be fast, you have to work hard.” If a swimmer is showing signs of over-training, it should not be ignored. Reduce training, either in terms of duration, intensity or frequency, both in and out of the pool. It might be necessary for the swimmer to take a few days off to recover, then start fresh with a new training plan. If caught early, a few days off will allow a swimmer to get back on the right track. Long-term over-training can result in a season of frustration and an associated drop in confidence and a loss of motivation to continue in the sport. Coaches must learn to emphasize the fact that rest is good just as strongly as they emphasize the benefits of hard work. The former is a difficult concept for many swimmers to accept, but it is an important one. Sometimes, just working hard does not result in speed; it results in an overly tired swimmer. There is a very fine line between working very hard and working too hard, and every swimmer’s threshold is slightly different. Finding each swimmer’s balance point is a crucial part of designing a training program that results in faster swimming. 27 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 27 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 30 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming SEASON PLANNING The goal of strength training is to progressively produce more swimming speed over a swimmer’s career, by season, and from meet to meet.

Strength Training for Faster Swimming SEASON PLANNING The goal of strength training is to progressively produce more swimming speed over a swimmer’s career, by season, and from meet to meet. Because the ultimate test of the effectiveness of a strength training program is race performance, we must plan our program with competition dates in mind. To ensure that a swimmer is ready to race well, the training plan must accommodate some degree of rest before race day. However, with swim meets scheduled an average of once per week during high school and college seasons, and once every two weeks for age group swimmers, planning for competitions poses training continuity problems. In addition, when frequently accommodating rest before swim meets, the cumulative effect of training is hard to achieve. For this reason, it is a good idea to look at the season as a whole and work toward a positive conclusion, allowing for benchmark or qualifying opportunities along the way. By defining three levels of competitions, some meets will be identified as priority events and incorporate planned breaks in training, while some will be treated as part of the training. 28 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 28 12.07.11 12:11 --- OCR from Page 30 Image 1 --- COLORADO --- Page 31 Text --- Making Strength Training Count PRACTICE MEETS In preparation for practice meets, little or no change in the training routine should be made. Just as we “swim through” some competitions, we can also strength train through them. No best times should be expected. Rather than best times, the objective should be stroke quality. TARGET MEETS In advance of target meets, the swimmer should be allowed some time to rest. While some swimmers require more rest than others, even one or two days break from the strength training routine can give a

be expected. Rather than best times, the objective should be stroke quality. TARGET MEETS In advance of target meets, the swimmer should be allowed some time to rest. While some swimmers require more rest than others, even one or two days break from the strength training routine can give a swimmer’s muscles an opportunity to recover enough to perform well without seriously interrupting the long-term strength training plan. Signs of improvement toward the strength training objective should be visible. Some best times can be expected. CHAMPIONSHIP MEETS Strength training should stop about two weeks before the championship meet to allow the swimmer time to adapt and rebuild fully. Although some swimmers get nervous that they will lose their strength, they should be assured that the work they have done on land will be maintained by using it in the pool during this strength training break. Best times should be achieved. After the competition season, the off-season period can provide a good block of time to build a solid base of well-rounded strength for the next competition season. It also provides the opportunity to make modifications in a swimmer’s strength training routine as determined through observation and evaluation of the swimmer’s overall performance during the season past. 29 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 29 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 32 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming 30 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 30 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 33 Text --- The Swimming Muscles 3 THE SWIMMING MUSCLES Swimming is considered by many to be the best form of full body exercise.

best form of full body exercise. The well-documented cardiovascular benefits of swimming focus largely on its healthy effect on the heart and lungs. Upon closer examination, we see that the function of the heart and lungs is to carry oxygen-rich blood to the working muscles and to transport oxygen-depleted blood away from them. What makes swimming particularly good for the heart and lungs is that so many muscles are being used at the same time. In fact, swimming uses almost every muscle in the body in a coordinated and repetitive, cycling manner that exposes them to sustained exertion in a medium that is thicker than air. Well-conditioned swimmers, in general, have extremely low resting heart rates, a measure of good fitness, and are known to have one of the most developed capillary systems of all athletes. As a swimmer is able to swim farther and faster, the oxygen demand of the muscles increases. As the heart and lungs adapt to meet the demand, new capillaries form, branching out from the existing blood supply network to better provide the muscles in use with more oxygen. Not only does swimming use more muscles at once than most other sports, it also uses muscles in ways that we don’t often use them for other activities. As erect beings, humans spend most of their time using our muscles from the vertical position. However, because swimming is done from a horizontal position, muscle exertion is initiated and carried out in different planes than we are used to. To illustrate this point, compare the actions 31 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 31 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 34 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming performed with the arms in rowing with those used in swimming. They have many similarities and use many of the same muscles. Rowing, in

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
muscles in the entire leg are used. In fact, it is common for people who are not used to swimming to experience cramps in the calf and in the arch of the foot when they swim due to the different requirements of the muscles when resistance is applied with the top of the foot. With all this in mind, a strength training program that will be effective for swimmers must consider the full body requirements of swimming, the unique ways swimmers use their muscles, and role each muscle group performs in the act of swimming. 32 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 32 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 35 Text --- The Swimming Muscles LINKING MUSCLE MOVEMENT Looking at the anatomy of the human body and the distribution of muscles, we can see that the largest muscles are situated closer to the center of the body. We can also see that the fibers that make up each muscle have a distinct grain. By examining the direction Muscle distribution and grain of this grain, as well as how the muscles overlap each other, and the point each muscle anchors to the bone, we get an indication of what sort of action each muscle group is capable of and responsible for. With this knowledge, we can better connect muscles to movement and employ them to better move us through the water. The sequence of muscles called to action in coordinated swimming works in a chain reaction to move the swimmer forward. This flow of energy travels through the body, passing from one muscle group to another throughout each stroke cycle, producing efficient forward motion. Often referred to as the kinetic chain, this connected movement is what a swimmer should strive to simulate in strength training. Rather than isolating one muscle, consider that that muscle is just

at high speed, we see that it holds its front limbs flat against the sides of its body and uses a narrow, undulating motion that starts at the head and moves down through its body. This wave action is based on movement and stabilization of the seal’s spine by the muscles that surround it. It is a swimming technique that de-emphasizes the limbs for producing speed in the water. In fact, the seal uses its front limbs for steering rather than propulsion. In addition, the evolution of the seal’s rear limbs has led them to be fused into one great limb down to the ankles, creating in essence an extension of the seal’s body. By using the muscles of its powerful trunk to produce and control movement, the seal has achieved a “limbless” swimming style that, in comparative studies, has recorded it swimming a distance of one mile more than six times faster than the fastest human swimmer, with five times less effort! In the absence of evolutionary adaptations such as webbed toes and a streamlined body shape that would make the human form more seal-like, we can learn a lot about swimming from this creature and work toward achieving a more seal-like technique that utilizes the muscles of our core to generate more efficiency and swimming speed. 39 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 39 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 42 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming The muscles of the core are crucial to the overall effectiveness of swimming. Core strength should be a main priority of any strength training program for swimmers. Strengthening the core involves targeting a series of muscles that work together to create a better foundation to swim from. These muscles are listed below. FRONT CORE MUSCLES The front core muscles include the abdominals, most visibly the

is an important consideration. Strength training encompasses a wide variety of activities, which meet a wide variety of objectives. For every stage, there are particular developmental milestones that should correspond to strength training objectives. As the stage of development changes, strength training objectives must change, too. The content of a strength program should complement the swimmer’s abilities at their particular stage and not impose demands that the swimmer is not ready for. A strength training program designed with objectives and activities that fit a swimmer’s stage of development will encourage faster swimming at each stage of development and over a swimmer’s career. 49 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 49 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 52 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming AT WHAT AGE SHOULD STRENGTH TRAINING BEGIN? The answer to this question is not as simple as how many birthdays a swimmer has had. In fact, there is little benefit to using chronological age as the measure for beginning a strength training program. Chronological age does not tell us much. There are 10-year-olds who are 5’6” and could be mistaken physically for 16-year-olds, and others who are 4’0” tall and could be mistaken for 7-year-olds. Chronological age also does not address swimming experience. Is the swimmer starting competitive swimming as a teenager, or have they been in the sport consistently since before Kindergarten? Once again, we return to the swimmer’s athletic base. A swimmer of any age who does not have an adequate athletic base must be trained as a beginner, although with more physical development, he or she can sometimes advance more quickly than a young beginner. Rather than chronological age, a more meaningful measure to use is physiological age. Physiological age, or the stage of physical development of a swimmer, provides a better picture of what kind of strength

although with more physical development, he or she can sometimes advance more quickly than a young beginner. Rather than chronological age, a more meaningful measure to use is physiological age. Physiological age, or the stage of physical development of a swimmer, provides a better picture of what kind of strength training the swimmer is ready for and can benefit from. 50 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 50 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 53 Text --- Stages of Development So, at what age should swimmers begin strength training? From day one, but the content of the strength training program must be carefully designed for the appropriate level of physical development and swimming experience. SPECIFIC WORK FOR SPECIFIC STAGES We will assign the following categories to the various stages of physical development for the purpose of identifying strength training objective, describing appropriate activities, and suggesting the frequency and duration of strength training sessions. Older beginners should start with the same activities as the first stage listed: • Elementary • Pre-adolescence • Adolescence • Young Adult • Adult • Senior 51 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 51 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 54 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming ELEMENTARY At this stage, the child’s head is proportionally large, and hands and feet are small, leading to some balance issues. The upper body and arm muscles are also generally less developed than lower body and leg muscles. Some children have big bellies, which should be evaluated before labeling the child as overweight. Often a large belly is the result of a growth-related posture imbalance in which the spine curves toward the belly. It is a condition that is usually soon outgrown. Children at this stage have an immense amount of energy but limited coordination and very little endurance. The objective of strength training at this stage of development

result of a growth-related posture imbalance in which the spine curves toward the belly. It is a condition that is usually soon outgrown. Children at this stage have an immense amount of energy but limited coordination and very little endurance. The objective of strength training at this stage of development is to build a solid athletic base. Appropriate strength training sessions three to five days a week, for about 15 minutes, should include activities that promote the five areas of general athleticism – using the child’s own resistance only – in short periods of work followed by periods of rest. This work should be fun in order to hold the characteristic short attention span of young children as long as possible. PRE-ADOLESCENCE Children at this stage of development experience rapid growth in both height and weight. Often the child has spurts where he or she grows lengthwise and then widthwise, leading to periods of awkwardness. Ultimately, the trunk and limbs lengthen and more strength is possible. Stamina also increases and coordination steadily develops. Balance eventually improves. The objective of strength training at this stage of development is to improve stability, coordination, and to build 52 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 52 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 55 Text --- Stages of Development THE EARLY DEVELOPER AND THE LATE BLOOMER At age 11, Peter was a dedicated member of the swim team who diligently swam five days a week, focusing on good technique and making every interval. He also participated in strength and quickness drills led by his coach three times a week. Peter’s work ethic was so admirable that he was given a trophy at the team’s annual awards banquet. Peter attended swim meets regularly, holding clearly in his mind the goal of swimming faster than ever before. One day, after placing fifth

of the water, developing a well-defined six pack that he was proud of. Eventually, Allen decided to trade in his jammers for a soccer ball. Peter kept whittling away slowly and patiently at his times in competition and, after advancing to the 13-14 division, he adopted the 100 fly as his new favorite. At the first meet of spring, Peter stepped up on the blocks, seeded tenth in the fly. He swam the first 50 with ease and precision but felt uneasy when he found himself with more energy than usual going in the last lap. Intent on giving the race his best, he put his head down and accelerated his stroke tempo. When the final wall came, Peter looked up and was shocked to see he had won the race, erasing nine full seconds from his previous best time. As he emerged from the pool, he heard a familiar voice. “I told you!” the coach said. Peter grinned widely. It was only then that he observed that he was not looking up at his coach, but looking at him eye to eye. He realized at that moment that his patience had paid off, and it was finally his turn to shine. 53 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 53 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 56 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming power. Appropriate strength training activities for this stage of development include exercises that address core stability balance and tempo, using the child’s own resistance only. This is a good stage to start focusing on perfecting form that will carry through to later stages of development. Such work can be done three to four days a week in sessions of about 20 minutes.

start focusing on perfecting form that will carry through to later stages of development. Such work can be done three to four days a week in sessions of about 20 minutes. ADOLESCENCE During adolescence, athletes go through a time of continuous change that includes physical maturing and weight gain. As they go through puberty, athletes experience periods of rapid strength gain alternating with periods where strength lags behind their growth. At times, their physical changes are accompanied by awkwardness and self- consciousness. At other times, they are accompanied by bravado and testing of their new characteristics. The objective at this stage of development is building power, force, stability, and coordination. When well supervised, swimmers can make important progress during this time, with gains in applicable strength. Sessions of 30 minutes or more, five days a week should include self-resistance work, medicine balls and some stretch bands, accompanied by clearly stated objectives. This combination of training can encourage swimmers to focus on achieving great improvements in swimming speed. YOUNG ADULT At this stage, the athlete has adult physical characteristics and size. This is a period when the athlete is at the peak of strength and performance potential. With a solid foundation of athleticism, swimming and strength work, the now fully mature swimmer can make huge and continuing gains in speed with dedication to a solid training routine and a healthy lifestyle. 54 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 54 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 57 Text --- Stages of Development The objective at this stage is maximizing force, power, and explosiveness. A strength program that encompasses weight training, stretch bands, medicine balls and self-resistance can encourage development of maximum strength by the athlete’s adult body that can be applied to swimming faster than ever before.

is maximizing force, power, and explosiveness. A strength program that encompasses weight training, stretch bands, medicine balls and self-resistance can encourage development of maximum strength by the athlete’s adult body that can be applied to swimming faster than ever before. A program of strength work four days a week for an hour can net the force, power, explosiveness, and stability results of a lifetime. ADULT During this stage, a very gradual decline of muscle size and strength is expected. The shape of the body changes subtly over time, frequently expanding at the waistline. With the obligations of “real life,” the adult athlete faces less training time and, in general, a less active lifestyle. For the adult athlete, the objective is maintenance. Holding on to physical fitness is certainly a challenge. As the years go by, maintenance should be viewed as improvement! With an ongoing routine of frequent swimming and strength work, it is possible for a swimmer to maintain his or her speed into the 40s and 50s. 55 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 55 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 58 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming A routine that includes strength training for an hour encompassing weights, stretch bands, medicine balls and self-resistance for three days a week will provide such maintenance. At this stage, it is important to make time for two days of solid rest as recovery just takes longer. SENIOR In the golden years, decline in the size and strength of muscles is evident, which sometimes contributes to balance and mobility problems. In addition, seniors can face bone strength and flexibility issues affecting posture and range of motion. Still, the senior who stays active and strong will be in a much better position to make the most of his or her ability to move freely through the water.

balance and mobility problems. In addition, seniors can face bone strength and flexibility issues affecting posture and range of motion. Still, the senior who stays active and strong will be in a much better position to make the most of his or her ability to move freely through the water. At this stage of development, the objective is flexibility and weight- bearing activity. Strength training is an essential part of a swimmer’s training routine. A program that includes conservative weights, stretch cords, and medicine balls, as well as self-resistance, two to three days a week for 30 minutes or more can produce bone density improvements, slow muscle decline, and along with the typical benefits of swimming, contribute to a better quality of life. 56 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 56 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 59 Text --- Stages of Development JUST KEEP SWIMMING Joy was a dedicated mother. For almost two decades, she devoted herself to the task of raising her twins to become happy, healthy, productive adults. She parented to encourage individuality, responsibility, compassion and self-respect. She strived to be a good example to her children. On their 18th birthday, Joy felt an immense sense of pride. Still, shortly thereafter, when they moved out on their own, she felt empty inside. A divorced 48-year-old, Joy looked at herself in the mirror and asked, “Who am I?” Her empty house and the new availability of time took quite a while to adjust to, but one day, Joy woke up with an idea. One of the good examples she had provided for her children was to maintain a regular physical fitness routine throughout their childhood.

One of the good examples she had provided for her children was to maintain a regular physical fitness routine throughout their childhood. An active competitive swimmer in her youth, Joy had chosen swimming as her fitness activity, going to the pool twice a week before daylight for an hour or so to swim laps. Although she was no longer a speed demon in the pool, she had maintained a healthy weight, good muscle tone and flexibility that other mothers often admired. Now that she didn’t have to hurry back home to meet the responsibilities of the household, she decided to re-dedicate herself to her sport. She increased her swimming time, adding another day a week, and then another half hour per session. She added variety to her swimming routine by doing sets and different strokes. It was not long before Joy started feeling the effects of her efforts and soon was able to do 100s on the 1:30 like she had when she was a teenager. Swimming became the passion in Joy’s life. She loved the challenge and confidence that swimming gave her. She kept track of her workouts, recording her yardage and tracking her progress toward benchmarks she set for herself. She read books on swimming science and technique, and incorporated what she learned into her swimming routine, even adding some stretch cord work to her program three times a week. At age 65, Joy was thrilled to become the grandmother of twins. To celebrate this milestone, she decided to enter a competition for adult swimmers. With anticipation, but no expectations, she arrived at the event and was pleased that she, by no means, was the oldest swimmer present. Elated by the camaraderie and positive atmosphere she encountered, she swam to a second place finish in the 200 backstroke.

Elated by the camaraderie and positive atmosphere she encountered, she swam to a second place finish in the 200 backstroke. The winner, a woman of at least 80, congratulated her as she climbed easily out of the pool. “Maybe, I’ll see you at the next meet,” Joy responded. “Yes, you will,” the woman asserted. “Until then, just keep swimming.” 57 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 57 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 60 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming 58 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 58 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 61 Text --- Let’s Get Specific 5 LET’S GET SPECIFIC TYPES OF STRENGTH TRAINING THAT BENEFIT SWIMMING This section introduces five kinds of strength training that benefit swimming in terms of building strength that is useable in the water. Under each of the five types of activity, specific exercises are listed. Each exercise has been selected for its transferability to swimming in terms of directionality, tempo and multi-muscle engagement. Each exercise is described, illustrated, and categorized by the area of the body it primarily targets. It is important to remember that although an exercise is described as targeting a particular area of the body, multiple muscles are involved, both in the target area, as well as in other areas of the body. For instance, exercises that target the upper body and arms usually involve the core as well. While all strength training is based on resistance, each type of exercise presented provides a different kind of challenge to the muscles. Some types are appropriate for all swimmers, but some are appropriate only at more advanced stages of development and are noted as such. SELF-RESISTANCE Self-resistance

Stretch cords are simply lengths of surgical tubing with loops or handles for each hand. When secured in the middle to a stationary pole, the stretch cord enables the swimmer to simulate the entire range of motion that makes up the power phase of the stroke against resistance. Stretch cords also require the use of an accelerating motion to accomplish the action successfully, exactly like swimming. The motion is repeated with a controlled reverse action or recovery between each exertion. The swimmer can use a tempo equal to his or her swimming tempo against resistance or practice an “ideal” higher tempo. Stretch cords also promote core stabilization, as the swimmer must maintain constant tension in

Fundamental principles represent the foundation from which you can structure a program that will have predictable and positive results. HOW MUCH AND HOW MANY? These are very important questions when it comes to strength training. We must clearly understand the significance of how much resistance, how many repetitions, at what rate, and how much frequency and duration is necessary in relation to our strength training objectives. Without this knowledge, we could end up with a different outcome than intended. More quantity does not always translate to more strength. Knowing “how much” and “how many” is as important as knowing which exercises to do. HOW MUCH RESISTANCE? With self-resistance work, the load that is resisted is exclusively the swimmer’s body weight, but when external load is added, as with stretch cords, medicine balls and weights, the question of how much resistance needs to be answered. In general, to build power,

which exercises to do. HOW MUCH RESISTANCE? With self-resistance work, the load that is resisted is exclusively the swimmer’s body weight, but when external load is added, as with stretch cords, medicine balls and weights, the question of how much resistance needs to be answered. In general, to build power, the athlete should be able to repeat the exercise with a load 12 to 15 times without failure. If he or she cannot do this, the load is too much. If it is extremely easy, the load is too little. In contrast, to build force, a larger load should be used. The athlete should be able to repeat an exercise only about three to five times. Again, if he or she cannot do this, the load is too much. If it is extremely easy, the load is too little. HOW MANY REPETITIONS? We also need to know how many times to repeat a particular action or sequence. We count repetitions, or reps, and we count sets. A rep is a single action of the exercise. Use the guidelines described above for reps. A set is a group of reps. Multiple sets have rest between them. As far as how many 97 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 97 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 100 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming sets to do, when the objective is force or explosiveness, fewer sets are done, and sometimes, only a single set is performed. When the objective is power or endurance, more sets are done. Most people do three to five sets when training for power. HOW MUCH RATE? How fast or slowly an exercise is repeated also is determined by the strength training objective. An exercise done at a faster rate tends to build force and explosiveness. An exercise done at slower rate tends

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
Most people do three to five sets when training for power. HOW MUCH RATE? How fast or slowly an exercise is repeated also is determined by the strength training objective. An exercise done at a faster rate tends to build force and explosiveness. An exercise done at slower rate tends to build power. With some exercises, it is possible to simulate swimming tempo very well by allowing the athlete to perform repetitions at a rate of about one per second. Stretch cord work is a good example of this. Some exercises are not designed for stroke tempo work, so do not attempt to achieve such a tempo. The Lat Pull is a good example of an exercise that should not be used for tempo work as it is very important not to rush the recovery, but to control it instead. HOW RESISTANCE, REPETITIONS AND RATE WORK TOGETHER To get the intended outcome, we look at the amount of resistance, or load, the number of repetitions and sets, and the rate that the exercise is performed together. For instance, if our objective is to develop force, we must pair fewer repetitions and sets with more load. If we try to build force by increasing both the number of repetitions and the load at the same time, the swimmer will soon experience failure, and the objective will not be met. In contrast, if our objective is to develop power, we must pair more repetitions and sets with less resistance. If we try to build power by increasing both the number of repetitions and the load at the same time, the swimmer will soon experience failure, and the objective will not be met. HOW MUCH FREQUENCY AND DURATION? Frequency refers to the number of strength training sessions in a week, month or season.

to build power by increasing both the number of repetitions and the load at the same time, the swimmer will soon experience failure, and the objective will not be met. HOW MUCH FREQUENCY AND DURATION? Frequency refers to the number of strength training sessions in a week, month or season. Duration refers to how long each session is. Frequency should be determined by the swimmer’s stage of development in conjunction with the strength training content. For instance, a program using weights, for developmentally advanced swimmers should accommodate rest and recovery time between sessions. A program for beginners, however, that is based on a good variety of self-resistance activities can be done several days in a row in order to develop a good athletic base. Swimmers in the adult or senior stages of development should build in more rest days, as recovery takes longer. 98 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 98 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 101 Text --- The Fundamentals BEFORE OR AFTER SWIMMING? When is the best time to do strength training, before or after swimming? The debate is ongoing. On the one hand, it is clear that strength training before swimming activates the muscles that will be used in the pool. Swimming-specific strength training before swimming also reinforces good form in the water. Studies have shown that the nervous system connections established and practiced on land carry over to stroke actions in the pool when swimming directly follows land activities. Finally, many believe that swimmers who swim regularly after a strength training develop better endurance, as swimming, which builds endurance very well, becomes an extension of a “super workout” begun on land, requiring the swimmer to adapt to a greater workload. On the other hand, some believe that since swimming elongates the muscles, strength work that follows swimming ensures that the

102 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Scheduling rest time is as important as scheduling workout time. Even routines based solely on self-resistance work should allow at least two days off per week. When the content of the strength work includes external load, at least three rest days are recommended. A routine of alternating work days and rest days works well. Some athletes use a daily schedule, by alternating days for upper body and lower body. Attention should be paid to levels of fatigue when using this model. A schedule of two work days in a row, followed by one rest day has also proven successful. The particular schedule should consider the rest requirements of the individual swimmer, assuming he or she is swimming five to six days a week. The duration of each strength training session should also be determined by a swimmer’s particular stage of development, as well as his or her swimming experience. In the early stages, sessions should be quite short because not a great deal of endurance has been developed. Still, a lot of work can be accomplished in 15 to 30 minutes! As the swimmer matures physically, longer training sessions of an hour or more are beneficial, both because the swimmer is capable of more and because more types of activities, more repetitions, and more sets take more time. Answering these fundamental questions must be done before strength training begins. To achieve more swimming speed, careful analysis of “how much and how many” should be done with the specific objective of the swimmer in mind. 100 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 100 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 103 Text --- The Fundamentals START RIGHT SAFETY Like the “No Diving” sign at the shallow end of the pool, safety rules are there for a reason.

Although you may be lucky diving into shallow water, the consequences are real and grave. When safety rules for conduct and equipment use are in place, observe them with respect. If safety rules are not in place, it is the responsibility of the supervisor to establish them. Supervision is a must, especially when children and inexperienced swimmers are engaged in strength training activities. The supervisor must ensure that safety rules are understood and followed. The supervisor must ensure that each activity is performed correctly and safely by each swimmer. The supervisor must ensure that each activity is appropriate for the swimmer’s stage of development and experience. Everyone engaged in strength training should use a proactive approach to preventing accidents by: Training With a Partner All strength training, especially with weights, should be done with a partner who can spot and assist, and observe technique. Handling Weights Correctly Lift weights from the floor using your legs rather than your back. Weights should never be dropped; hey can break bones. They should also not be left on the floor to trip on. Medicine balls should never be thrown at the face or the groin, only at the chest and when the person is looking. Wearing Shoes Although most swimmers are very comfortable in bare feet around the pool deck, shoes should be mandatory for any strength training activity involving external weight or moving with impact on the feet. While many exercises can be done safely without shoes on the pool deck or gym, it

done regularly in terms of load, number of repetitions and sets and rate will allow us to track our progress. The Strength Training Log presented on page 162 provides a basic structure for tracking progress. Make copies and use one sheet per month to record your strength training progress over time. At the beginning of each month, fill in the exercises that you will track on the left side of the page. Then, after each strength training session throughout the month, record your results for those exercises. Record the number of sets, repetitions or other information specific to the exercise for comparison. At the end of the month, do a test set to gauge adaptation. A test set takes three of the exercises you have been doing throughout the month and increases the difficulty of each. The exact way the difficulty is increased depends on the objective. For instance, if your objective is more force, more load would be attempted. If your objective is tempo, more repetitions would be attempted in a fixed time. At the bottom of the Progress Log, a space is provided to record the results of a monthly test set. If test set results show that you are able to perform the exercises with increased difficulty, then as you begin a new month of strength training, use the test set degree of difficulty as your new base. Remember to focus on your objective. If you are training for more force, don’t expect to see much progress in terms of number of repetitions. Look instead for progress in terms of amount of resistance. If you are training for more power, don’t expect to see much progress in terms of the load. Look instead for rate, or number of repetitions. Progress tracked that does not meet the objective,

in terms of number of repetitions. Look instead for progress in terms of amount of resistance. If you are training for more power, don’t expect to see much progress in terms of the load. Look instead for rate, or number of repetitions. Progress tracked that does not meet the objective, should be watched closely over several more weeks. Random progress across the board can be expected, but a trend of progress toward other than the strength objective indicates some change in the training content or routine is needed. 159 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 159 12.07.11 12:14 --- Page 162 Text --- 160 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 160 12.07.11 12:14 --- Page 163 Text --- Conclusion CONCLUSION As you embark on a strength training program with the goal of achieving more swimming speed, please keep this thought in your mind. To become a fast swimmer, you have to be prepared to sow before you reap. Swimming is a sport that takes a lot of dedication over time. Day after day, you have to believe that all your training will pay off. Month after month, you have to have faith that you are developing in the right direction. Year after year, you have to trust that your ultimate swimming goal will be realized. In this age of immediate gratification, swimmers have to be so patient! So, as you catch the next medicine ball, or make your way around the next circuit, take pride in your dedication and enjoy the process of moving toward your goal. 161 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 161 12.07.11 12:14 --- Page 164 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming 162 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 162 12.07.11 12:14 --- OCR from Page 164 Image 1 --- 13S LS3.1 ATHLNOW SED Many anqoalag asaxS Hi lols =|) oo) + a. o TIVWe SNIOIGIW oo

is one of the things lots of untrained swimmers have trouble with. Often it’s because they’re turning their head to breathe by twisting their neck around, lifting their chin, or both. This makes your stroke lumpy and uneven, and tends to lead to snaking along the pool when you should be arrowing. Good swimmers make taking a breath part of the natural roll of their body. Their face comes smoothly out of the water as their pull finishes. They take a breath in the first part of the recovery stage, and during the second part their face rotates back below the surface. Many swimmers breathe every two strokes, always on the same side of their body. This isn’t ideal, as it means their stroke and body position is biased to one side. It’s much better to train yourself to breathe every three strokes. Count your strokes Before you start putting Swim Better, Swim Faster into practice, count how many strokes on average it takes you to swim a length of front crawl. This is your baseline for working out if your stroke is improving. Fewer strokes per length = a more efficient stroke. Watch other swimmers --- Page 14 Text --- If you see someone with a really good stroke, try to fix how it looks in your mind’s eye. Imagine yourself swimming the same way. While you’re swimming along, make a comparison – are my arms going at the same speed? Am I gliding in the same way? Is my body rolling from side to side like his/hers? BODY POSITION Your body should always be in a straight line pointing toward the end of the pool, like a pencil floating on the surface. One common way of expressing this is to imagine you’re a human kebab, with an unbendable

one smooth movement, with your hand accelerating toward the end of the pull. It’s useful, though, to separate the underwater action into three phases: • Catch, in which your arm moves into a position in which it can start to add significant propulsion. • In-sweep, in which your elbow is held high, bent at 90°, and your hand sweeps in toward the edge of your body • Out-sweep, when having swept inward your hand comes out again, and leaves the water with your thumb close to or brushing your thigh. Some swimmers prefer to simplify the arm-pull action and pull straight back using a high-elbow position rather than separating the second part of the stroke into an in-sweep and out-sweep. (The roll of their body means they are not actually likely to be pulling back in a straight line.) If you find the arm pull --- Page 67 Text --- action tricky, this straight-back pulling action may be a better option. Be aware, though, that you do need a good streamlined position and roll in your stroke for this to work well. THE CATCH The catch is important because getting it right sets up the rest of your stroke. It is the transition into the most powerful part of the arm stroke, which actually drives you forward. The crucial thing to remember is that you should keep your elbow high, using it as a pivot to swing your hand down and back. To most people, the high-elbow position feels a bit unnatural at first. Because of this, it’s worth taking a bit of time to rebuild your arm stroke from the ground up. The straight-arms scull and bent-arms scull drills that follow are the starting point, and allow you to get a feel for the water using a high-elbow position.

The zipper version is trickier: if it’s a bit tough, put it aside and come back to it later when your stroke’s improved. --- Page 83 Text --- 1. Swim normally, using the high-elbow style you’ve developed after reading the first bit of this chapter. Once you’re in a rhythm, stop lifting your hands completely clear of the water. Instead, drag your fingertips along the surface. 2. Breathe normally, and focus on maintaining a good body roll with each stroke. Keep your elbows high, so that your fingertips trace a line quite close to the side of your body. 3. You can develop this drill by having completely loose wrists and letting the back of your hand drag along the surface. --- Page 84 Text --- 4. Try a variation known as the zipper drill. As your arm recovers, pretend you’re undoing a zipper that runs from your hips to your armpit. Your thumb should never lose contact with your side. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER Having worked your way through the earlier part of this chapter, you deserve a bit of a rest. Not yet, though! There’s one more drill to learn, which allows you to practise the whole arm stroke, concentrating on every aspect of it, before you start swimming using your redesigned arm stroke. --- Page 85 Text --- High-elbow drills Try these drills without swim fins, but if you find your hips are dragging put some on to keep your

will emerge. I also find swimming blind is a useful way of concentrating on how your stroke feels. It’s amazing how much easier it is to sense the effectiveness of your arm pull, or the degree of water resistance you’re experiencing, with your eyes shut. Start by swimming along above a line on the bottom of the pool. Initially, just close your eyes for three or four strokes before opening them to check where you are. As your feel for how to swim straight with your eyes shut improves, you’ll probably be able to keep them closed for longer periods. This exercise is excellent for open-water swimmers, who need to be able to swim straight without sighting on the bottom of a pool or by looking at lane lines. As an illustration, World Open-Water Swimmer of the Year 2009 and 2011 Keri-Anne Payne attributes part of her success to the fact that she learnt to swim without goggles, couldn’t really see where she was going and had to develop a feel for swimming in a straight line.

As a result, most people’s swimming improves when they get a chance to watch themselves swim. They immediately see where their stroke differs from a really expert swimmer’s.

They immediately see where their stroke differs from a really expert swimmer’s. Filming swimming The ideal scenario is for a friend to film you swimming. This is likely to be impossible in a public pool, as they generally don’t allow cameras. If you can get access to a private pool, though, it’s worthwhile getting a friend with a video camera to shoot some footage. Warm up first, and do a bit of swimming before the camera rolls, so that your stroke is working as it would in normal circumstances. Filming swimmers can be tricky, as people are rightly sensitive to cameras in swimming pools. If you can get permission to film, though, the benefits of seeing yourself swim are tremendous. Use lights and shadows Sometimes pools with lights in the walls can give you a glimpse of your stroke. It’s a bit like trying to get a glimpse of yourself in a shop window while cycling past, but if you swim at night, the lights will probably cast a shadow that’s defined enough to give you some idea of how your stroke is looking. --- Page 135 Text --- Keys to success • Keep your head in a good, streamlined position, and roll your body with every arm stroke • Swim with your eyes closed every once in a while, to assess whether your stroke is balanced • Take opportunities to watch yourself swim, in order to spot glitches in your technique --- Page 136 Text --- TURNS turn verb twist, rotate, go round, roll, twirl, move to face a different direction, move around an axis They’re not actually part of swimming technique, of course, but lots of people want to learn tumble turns, because they’re a good way of improving the distance you can cover in a set time.

water going up your nose. Getting used to tumbling Lots of swimmers get disoriented about which way is up when they try to learn tumble turns. They quickly get a snortful of water up their nose, come up coughing and spluttering, and give up. The trick to learning a tumble turn is to break it down into stages. This drill is the first step: getting used to tumbling underwater. 1. Push off the wall, but instead of adopting a streamlined position, push off with both hands by your sides. 2. Before you lose too much momentum, tuck your chin into your chest and --- OCR from Page 139 Image 1 --- Jaki sy lil wt ae yay --- Page 140 Text --- start a forward-roll motion. Lead with your head, and aim for this to be a snappy and definite movement. 3. Let your body, then your legs, follow your head around. Make your body as compact as possible, so that you tumble over quickly, and bend your legs too. Only take a breath when you’ve come back to the surface facing the same way as you were moving. Arm stretch tumble This drill first adds an element of stretching your arm out in front of you to tumble over, then of swimming into the tumble. 1. Push off the wall as in the push-off drill, except with one arm extended in the streamlined position. Have the other arm against your side. 2. Before you lose momentum, perform the tumble. The movement is similar to the previous drill, but this time it’s your arm that drives it, rather than your head: begin an arm pull, but continue the motion underneath your body, as if reaching back toward the space between your knees. 3. Let your head follow, and then the

OPEN-WATER EVENTS --- Page 151 Text --- Open-water swimming actually encompasses a tremendous range of types of swimming. The simplest is wild swimming – taking pleasure in swimming somewhere other that a chemically sterile pool. At the other extreme is open- water racing, long-distance endurance events in which the world’s top swimmers race for hours, and usually finish just seconds apart. There are also solo endurance swims such as Channel crossings, swim-trek holidays and even open- water orienteering. Whatever kind of open-water swim you’re planning, they all have

extreme is open- water racing, long-distance endurance events in which the world’s top swimmers race for hours, and usually finish just seconds apart. There are also solo endurance swims such as Channel crossings, swim-trek holidays and even open- water orienteering. Whatever kind of open-water swim you’re planning, they all have a few things in common. Adaptability and a willingness to swim without lane lines or guides are key. • You’ll need to be able to adapt your stroke to the water conditions and temperature. • You’ll need to prepare for different swimming environments (i.e. how many other swimmers are in the water with you, and where the swim is taking place). • It’s important to adapt your training so that it suits the kind of swim you’re planning to do. SWIM WITH A TRAINING PARTNER As with any sport, your training needs to mirror the thing you’re training for. If you’re taking part in an open-water event, this obviously means some, at least, of your training should be done in open water. It’s a really good idea to do this with a training partner. Ideally you want another swimmer of about the same standard as you, but you could also go out with a kayaker, SUP paddler, paddleboarder, etc. --- Page 152 Text --- There are two key benefits to a training partner: Safety: Open water, particularly the ocean, is potentially a lot more dangerous than pool swimming. Having someone with you makes things a little safer. Motivation: The open-water environment can be a bit off-putting on cold, wet days. Knowing someone else is relying on you to come out helps. Having someone swimming alongside also helps you to push your level, rather than sitting back and taking it easy. Of course, you’ll also get to share the joy of

very quickly. A quick Google search will tell you which companies make swimming wetsuits: among the main brands are 2XU, Aqua Sphere, Ironman, Orca and Speedo, but there are lots of others. Decide on your price point, and try on as many as you can. It’s really worth visiting a shop: there’s no substitute for seeing how the suit actually fits your body shape. It needs to be as tight as possible but not constrictively short or draggily long. Getting out of your wetsuit In a triathlon, you have plenty of time to get into your wetsuit, but you’ll want to get out of it as fast as possible in order to start the bike leg. The only way to get good at this is to practise, at the end of open-water training sessions. --- Page 155 Text --- 1. As soon as you emerge from the water, start running toward your bike. Reach behind and grab the puller ribbon on your wetsuit. 2. With the other hand, undo the Velcro tab that holds most wetsuits closed. Next pull down the zipper. 3. Peel off first one arm, then the other. Then peel the suit down to your waist. The wetsuit will be half inside-out at this point. --- Page 156 Text --- 4. When you reach your bike, bend over and peel down/step out of the wetsuit legs. TECHNIQUE: ARM STROKE The arm stroke for open-water front crawl is essentially the same as for pool swimming. As in the pool, a smoother, more efficient stroke uses less energy for the same speed. This is probably even more important in open water: events are over longer distances, so the effect of tiny inefficiencies is magnified. One difference from the pool is in stroke rate: open-water swimmers generally swim with a

a breath – if your head comes out that high, you’ve lifted it too far. 4. Take an arm stroke, during which your body rolls to the side allowing you to take a breath as usual. --- Page 162 Text --- Balanced-arms drill This exercise is useful for a) finding out whether one of your arm strokes is more powerful than the other, and b) correcting imbalances. In open water, balanced arms will make it easier to swim in a straight line. You will need • Fins • Pull buoy 1. Push off in a streamlined position, with fins on and the pull buoy between your thighs. 2. Swim a timed 50m using only your right arm. Concentrate on maintaining a high elbow during the pulling phase, and breathe every three or four strokes. 3. Repeat with your left arm, then run through the whole exercise twice more (so you’ll have done 3 × 50m on each arm). 4. Average out your times on each arm. If one is significantly slower, work on --- Page 163 Text --- improving that arm’s stroke. Some coaches recommend wearing a hand paddle to strengthen a weak arm. A better alternative is probably to use volume training: do one-arm drills in units of three, with two on your weaker arm and one on the stronger one. --- Page 166 Text --- If you’re lucky enough to have access to a whole pool, positioning turn buoys at the corners, near the backstroke flags, gives you a big area of water to work with. You can swim along the edges, between the corners in an X shape, in a Z pattern ... wherever you imagination (or your coach) leads you. Even if some of the pool is taken up with other swimmers and you can only

a big area of water to work with. You can swim along the edges, between the corners in an X shape, in a Z pattern ... wherever you imagination (or your coach) leads you. Even if some of the pool is taken up with other swimmers and you can only get a couple of lanes, a pair of turn buoys allows you similar training options. TRAINING FOR OPEN WATER The key difference between pool and open-water swimming is the lack of turns. In a 25-metre pool you rarely actually swim more than 20m at a time. Then you get a push off the wall, which gives you a chance to break the swim. In an open- water event, you may swim a kilometre or more without interrupting your rhythm. If you don’t practise for it, this comes as quite a shock. Pool training It sounds obvious, but before you enter a 1km or 1.5km open water swim, you --- OCR from Page 166 Image 1 --- > —&—=-_ Swim direction > > => =p dP > Swim directi > e. wim direction —> > 00.0 0,910 6 0.0 6 0 08 0 8 8 OS oe 6 8 8 8 eg ee > > JO SU“ 0 Ce 88 6 16 Cee ee ee eee ee ee Fe ee > > @ 0 16 0,8) 0 6 6 6 0.10 6 Oe 0 8 8 68 8 8 6 8 8 et ee Oe > > Backstroke flags Backstroke flags <—= Swim direction Length 3 Length Swim direction —> I SL PD EL Backstroke flags Backstroke flags --- Page 167 Text --- need to make sure you can swim that distance continuously.

(In fact, it’s a good idea to build up to 130 per cent of your event distance.) This can be done in a pool, though ideally not in a single lane, as you need space to turn around without touching the wall and this can be cramped in a single lane’s width. The ideal is to get access to a whole pool, though a couple of lanes is enough. If you set up buoys in opposite corners, you can swim the entire race distance without touching the sides or breaking your stroke. Training with other open-water swimmers in the pool also gives you the chance to swim in conditions you’ll experience in the event. Try all setting off together, for example, to get a feel for swimming in crowded water at the start. Follow other swimmers, or swim beside them, to get a feel for drafting. Paceline training One good exercise for anyone planning an open-water swim is to train in a paceline. You need at least three swimmers, and no more than five. The paceline allows everyone to build endurance, even in a mixed-ability group. It works in pretty much the same way as on a bike: 1. Set off in a line, with each swimmer close behind the one in front. You need to be almost touching their feet. 2. After a set distance or time, the leader pulls off the front. In a pool, it’s best just to stop after, say, 100m and let everyone else go by; in open water, the leader can just drift back after a minute on the front, then tag

touching their feet. 2. After a set distance or time, the leader pulls off the front. In a pool, it’s best just to stop after, say, 100m and let everyone else go by; in open water, the leader can just drift back after a minute on the front, then tag on to the back of the line. (If you’ve got a kayaker or someone who can blow a whistle at one-minute intervals, it makes this a lot easier.) 3. The new leader swims the same distance, before rotating back and allowing the swimmer behind to come through. All the swimmers need to have similar abilities, but you can make adjustments to fit quite a wide range. If stronger swimmers take longer pulls on the front, and weaker swimmers either take shorter turns or miss them, a fairly mixed group can train together. --- Page 168 Text --- Top tip ONCE IN A WHILE, DO A FARTLEK SESSION IN THE POOL Fartlek is really a run-training style, which is designed to improve both aerobic and anaerobic performance. The basic idea is that you’re continuously moving, but varying your pace. In a pool, you can do this by swimming between the backstroke flags, rather than to the end of the pool, then turning without touching the bottom or sides. Vary your pace: a few full-out sprints, some relaxed swimming and some race-pace all jumbled together. This swimmer is doing a tumble turn short of the edge of the pool, so that she won’t be able to push off. Starting to swim from a motionless beginning places much greater demands on your fitness and technique than an ordinary turn. Putting a few short turns like this into your training is a good way to vary your sessions. Open-water acclimatisation Although you can train

the tough nuts, among the tough world of open-water racing. The competitors had to swim through large blooms of jellyfish, and some of the favourites failed even to finish. It’s an extreme example, but it does show that open-water swimmers need to be ready to face unexpected challenges, including waves, boat exhaust fumes, seaweed, fog and tidal currents. OPEN-WATER SWIMS If you’ve never done an open-water swim event before, it can be a bit daunting. Before the event, consider where to position yourself and how to get the most from your swim. This depends to some extent on your aims. If you want to compete at the front, you’ll be mixing it with a bunch of ambitious, sharp- elbowed swimmers. If you want simply to enjoy the swim and finish feeling you’ve done well, a more relaxed approach will work better. --- Page 170 Text --- Starts Swims often begin with a massed start. The racers will try to position themselves wherever they have the shortest route to the first turn buoy. When the starter’s hooter goes, this area will be a churning maelstrom of arms and legs, as people sprint to get clear water and a good position. If you’d prefer a more leisurely start, either move off to the side or let the competitive swimmers get going for a few seconds, then swim behind them. Turns Turns offer competitive swimmers a golden opportunity to take time out of other racers. Turning as close as possible to the buoy, without losing speed, can gain you several metres. Of course, that means the area close to the turn buoy becomes a pinch point: if you’re not competing, and want only to enjoy your swim, you may think it’s a better idea to give the buoy a wider berth. Rounding a

without losing speed, can gain you several metres. Of course, that means the area close to the turn buoy becomes a pinch point: if you’re not competing, and want only to enjoy your swim, you may think it’s a better idea to give the buoy a wider berth. Rounding a buoy This is a good exercise for competitive open-water swimmers. It gets you corkscrewing round a turn buoy very quickly. You will need • Ideally, an anchored buoy 1. Swim at the buoy, sighting a couple of times as you get close to it. --- Page 171 Text --- 2. Aim to swim very slightly past the buoy, taking a stroke with the arm closest to the buoy (your left) as you come past. 3. Instead of taking another front crawl stroke, continue the roll of your body so that you turn on to your back. As you do this, twist slightly toward the buoy. 4. Take a stroke of backstroke with your other arm. Use this to continue to roll in the same direction, taking you back on to your front. With practice, this will get you round a 90° turn very fast, without the need to lift your head, do a little bit of breaststroke, etc. --- Page 172 Text --- SWIM STRATEGY FOR TRIATHLON If you are swimming open water as part of a triathlon, it’s worth thinking about how your swim will fit with your overall performance. Bear in mind that triathlons are never won on the swim leg. To get a good overall performance you’ll need to balance two key elements: finishing position versus energy expended. Unless you’re a very strong swimmer, pushing yourself to keep up with a fast group will leave you too tired for the bike and run legs. In general, it’s

the swim leg. To get a good overall performance you’ll need to balance two key elements: finishing position versus energy expended. Unless you’re a very strong swimmer, pushing yourself to keep up with a fast group will leave you too tired for the bike and run legs. In general, it’s better to finish the swim feeling somewhat within yourself, rather than as if you’re about to throw up through the effort. (Save that sensation for the run.) --- Page 173 Text --- Practising in open water will give you a clear idea of your maximum sustainable pace. Try to fix the rhythm of your stroke in your head. It’s possible to buy aids to help with this, including head attachments that tap out a preset rhythm, and watches that count the number of strokes you take each length. Navigation practice Navigation is a combination of efficient sighting and swimming straight toward a buoy or finish. Swimming straight for 25m, then efficiently sighting, will make any open-water swim easier. It does take practice, though! You will need • A small cone • A coach or helper 1. Position your coach or helper, armed with the cone, at the opposite end of the pool. (This exercise requires a pool that’s pretty much empty, or it can be done 20m or so out from the bank of a river, lake, etc.) 2. Push off the wall and start swimming. While you are underwater, your assistant will be putting the cone down somewhere along the far edge of the pool. 3. As you come to the surface, take a stroke or two and then sight as in the --- Page 174 Text --- head position drill, looking for the cone. 4. Swim to the cone without sighting again, aiming to finish your length as

this drill easier, as it creates more of a bow wave for you to breathe behind. Focus on keeping your body as flat and straight in the water as possible and on looking directly down as you swim along. As your upper goggle breaks the surface, make sure the line of the surface splits your vision perpendicularly. This tells you that your head is not lifting forward as you breathe. Set 2 • 8 × 25m, 15-second gap between each 25m Do the rolling breath drill. Focus entirely on the angle of your head as you breathe, trying to keep one goggle in the water and making sure the line of the water’s surface splits your vision, as above. Warm down • 200m, alternating 50m front crawl full stroke, 25m Tarzan-and-Jane, 25m catch-up Session 5 Duration • 20–30 minutes This session focuses on the high-elbow action; this is tricky to learn if you --- Page 183 Text --- have previously swum in another style, so it’s worth revisiting regularly. Warm up Swim 400m, broken down into: • 100m front crawl • 200m alternating front crawl and backstroke every 25m • 100m front crawl Set 1 • Lane-line initiation As a reminder of the sensation you’re looking for, do the lane-line practice a few times. • 8 × 25m pulling drill, 15-second gap between each 25m Follow high elbows drill. Focus on putting your hand into the water in front of your elbow, making sure it does not drift inward,* then beginning your pull with the same motion as you practised on the lane line. *Notice the way your body rolls as your arm takes a pull, and returns to a flat position as your hand re-enters the water. This return to a flat position can cause your hand/arm to drift

he won his first international race at a Home Nations competition in Scotland. At 13 Paul broke into the national junior team after winning a silver medal at the national championships, and he went on to race internationally for two seasons. He also captured the national short-course 100m and 200m records. Paul then retired from swimming, in search of a girlfriend who didn’t always smell of chlorine. In his mid-twenties Paul found his way back into swimming, racing at masters level and working with other swimmers to help them to improve their technique. Gradually he began to realise the lack of help available for older swimmers who wanted to get better, and were fit enough to do so, but were being held back by their technique. All Paul’s coaching is based on a simple principle: drag is your enemy. The Swim Better, Swim Faster approach has proved extremely popular with triathletes and keen leisure swimmers alike, as these happy former students will tell you: --- Page 188 Text --- ‘It’s like a new beginning. I felt before that I needed to get fitter and stronger to improve my swimming. Now I know the truth.’ ‘It all now seems less complicated than I’ve been making it.’ ‘I normally dread our swimming sessions, but this showed us how to use our training to better effect, rather than just slogging up and down the pool.’ ‘I improved my open-water swim time by 12 per cent.’ ‘One of the poolside lifeguards has just told me how well I’m swimming compared to when he’d last seen me.

As the National Governing Body for the development of triathlon coaching and coaches in Great Britain, our mission is focused on developing a world-leading triathlon coaching system, and indeed world class coaches to support the development of triathletes at all levels, from grassroots to high performance. As part of a recent review of our coach education system, and supporting learning resources, we identified the need to bring in respected specialists in a variety of areas to help us provide the most up-to-date innovative thinking. Swim Smooth was identified to support us on the swim coaching aspect of our education programmes. We didn’t just want a swim expert per se, we needed a company that understood triathlon swimming and, crucially, how to coach it in a real context. Swim Smooth has built an impressive international reputation and it is exciting that we can now utilise their experience and skills as part of our coaching programme. Swim Smooth will

sessions. Whatever your current ability level you would fit in nicely if you were here! We have beginners starting out who struggle to swim a lap at the moment, intermediate triathletes looking to improve their performances, age-group swimmers challenging themselves with swims of 20 km or more and elite triathletes and swimmers dominating their races. We are very proud of our ability to coach and develop this huge range of swimmers. Alongside these squads we use advanced video analysis above and below the water to help swimmers understand what is holding them back in their strokes and exactly how to improve their speed and efficiency. We have been at the forefront of this technology for the last twelve years and have conducted thousands of analysis sessions in that time – in fact many of the photos in this book are taken from these video analysis and stroke correction sessions. In Chapter 16 we will show you how to run your own video analysis session at your pool using your own camera in movie-mode. This will give you such a powerful insight into your swimming that we strongly recommend you film yourself if at all possible. Developing coaches outside of Swim Smooth is also a real passion of ours and we regularly travel to North America and Europe to run advanced level training courses for swimming coaches to further their skills. In 2010 we were appointed by the British Triathlon as coaching consultants for swimming and have re-written the syllabus and training courses for their Coach Education system based on our methods. --- Page 11 Text --- Paul and Adam.

We run year-round open water skills sessions (great fun and our favourite sessions of the week) and regularly consult with elite triathletes and open water swimmers from around the world looking to improve their swimming. If that wasn’t enough to keep us busy, all of the Swim Smooth coaches are competitive swimmers or triathletes themselves and have been racing for many years. Working with so many swimmers in such an in-depth way has created an insightful, innovative and unique programme for you to enjoy whatever your level of swimming. No other group in the world has immersed itself in these experiences simultaneously for over ten years – we really do ‘live swimming’ – and don’t we know it when the alarm goes off at 4:15am every morning for squad training! Becoming 11 Again Before we get into all the details of stroke technique and how to train, let’s consider something possibly even more important: your mental approach to swimming. This might be a key advantage that our 11- year-old swimmer has over you: she swims without inhibition or self-imposed limitation. She doesn’t over-analyse, she’s not self- conscious and she doesn’t doubt herself. She looks forward to getting out of school, jumping in the water and having fun. Fun is a key part of the Swim Smooth philosophy because enjoyment really does have the power to make you a better swimmer. With enjoyment comes motivation and the desire to practice the right things on a consistent basis that will ultimately result in improved performance. If swimming is currently a bit of a frustrating experience for you, or even a ‘necessary evil’ for triathlon, then of course you need to improve your stroke

enjoyment comes motivation and the desire to practice the right things on a consistent basis that will ultimately result in improved performance. If swimming is currently a bit of a frustrating experience for you, or even a ‘necessary evil’ for triathlon, then of course you need to improve your stroke technique and possibly your fitness preparation too, which we will show you how to do in this book. But over and above that, a positive ‘care-free’ mental approach is so important, it could literally make the difference between you achieving your goals in the water or not. From time to time we will challenge you with coordinating an area of your stroke or perhaps undertaking a tough training set. We can’t promise you that it will always be easy but if you are ever tempted to think ‘I can’t!’ then take a leaf out of that 11-year- --- Page 12 Text --- old’s book: clear your mind and just go for it!

However, none of this work would have been possible without the help, guidance and inspiration of quite a few key people in my life. I was always told by my mum (Linda) at swimming competitions to do my best and that no one else could ever ask any more from me than that. Given that I knew quite a lot of kids with very pushy parents when I was in my pre-teens, this advice certainly helped seal my love for the sport of swimming as a keen interest rather than something I was forced into. My mum’s devotion to taking me training every morning and every night and suspending her own interests out of commitment to my own passion was totally selfless and something I can only dream of aspiring to with my children. Thanks Mum – this book is for you. Paul Newsome I read two very inspiring and thought-provoking books just prior to commencing work on this project, which got me thinking about my own development as an athlete and now a coach. The first, Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, says that to excel in any field, one must accumulate at least 10,000 hours of practical experience and sound application of those experiences. When I emigrated to Perth in Western Australia I was fortunate enough to find a hub of swimming activity for all levels, ages and backgrounds far surpassing anywhere else in the world. With more 50m pools per head of population than anywhere else on the planet, and a multitude of fantastic open water swimming venues, I found myself immersed in a swimming

to find a hub of swimming activity for all levels, ages and backgrounds far surpassing anywhere else in the world. With more 50m pools per head of population than anywhere else on the planet, and a multitude of fantastic open water swimming venues, I found myself immersed in a swimming Mecca with the demand for professional coaching enough to support a thriving full-time business. Over the years I --- Page 14 Text --- have been incredibly fortunate to work with such a massively diverse group of swimmers and triathletes. If it weren’t for them I would not have been able to formulate the ideas behind our unique Swim Types system. I owe thanks to each and every swimmer who I have ever coached in a 1-2-1, clinic or squad situation for allowing me to analyse their strokes and make sense of what efficiency means, not just scientifically, but on an applied basis in the real world. This book is also dedicated to you all in recognition of the need to sometimes go against convention and discover a more pragmatic way to coach a range of different swimmers. The mighty Challenge Stadium, Perth as seen in our DVDs. In the second book, Bounce by Matthew Syed, discussion is drawn to the fact that dedicated hard work rather than raw talent and chance encounters with the right people at the right time in your life helps nurture success and cultivate new ideas. Every coach that I have worked with as an athlete has always instilled this idea of hard work and dedication within me and fortunate liaisons, close friendships and training and racing experiences with some of the world’s best athletes have all helped form my coaching knowledge, persona and understanding of what it takes to achieve at a high level in

To my coaches: Geoff Edmunds, Tony York, Mike Craven, Mrs Brown and Mrs Greenall who all played a role in getting me started in swimming at my first ever club in Bridlington, East Yorkshire; Eric Elbourne who first suggested to me at the age of ten that video analysis would be a good way to show me what I could be doing better in my own stroke, and Ben Pollard who showed me that swim coaching could be a professional pursuit at the Hull Olympic Club; Martin Mosey who encouraged me (at the time as a triathlete) to join his elite swim programme for solid early morning sessions, and to Maurice Pegg who showed so much passion and enthusiasm for swimming at the Borough of Kirklees Club; my running coach Brian Burgin at the Halifax Harriers who demonstrated how a no-nonsense mindset can drive an athlete far beyond his physical capabilities; David Lyles, Ian Turner and ‘Bernie’ at the University of Bath who again all encouraged me to swim within an elite programme witnessing first-hand how the best swimmers in the UK and Europe train even as a triathlete when many swim coaches might have scorned my triathlon interests; Richard --- OCR from Page 14 Image 1 --- Se --- Page 15 Text --- Hobson who gave such support during my university days and Robin Brew who showed me the technicalities of an efficient open water swimming stroke in a language that could be easily applied;

I am sure I will have accidentally omitted someone’s name in this list, but rest assured, if I’ve trained with you for any reasonable time I owe something to you too – thanks! Swimming coaching is notoriously ‘system’ oriented and the large majority of successful coaches tend to work for local, state or national governing bodies who are able to support and assist with funding and salaries. Unfortunately this approach has never been for me as I have always preferred to have the freedom to do things my way and in a manner that I believe in–devoid of politics and committee decisions. With freedom, though, comes risk as a self-employed coach, and without doubt I have to credit this entrepreneurial

and would like to believe that we have helped create a movement against there being just a ‘one size fits all’ approach to swim coaching. We hope that our recently appointed status as coaching consultants to the British Triathlon, and our work with the thousands of coaches worldwide who share our philosophy, will aid this effort further. The world needs better swimming. Thanks also to Giles O’Brien and Paul Moss at the British Triathlon for seeking our help with the British Triathlon coaching programme and to Miles Kendall, Andrew Kennerley and all the publishing team at John Wiley & Sons Ltd. who have allowed this dream to come to fruition by approaching us to produce this body of work you have in your hands right now. And, finally, a massive thanks to my wife Michelle and my children Jackson and Isla who have supported me through all of the hard work and devotion to my swim coaching career. I have to sacrifice much on a daily basis to do what I do and I often wonder if a nine-to-five job would be a better pursuit in this respect. However, this just wouldn’t be me and I have massive respect for Michelle recognising this within me. Michelle has been there from the very start of Swim Smooth: from the very early days travelling around the UK and Europe in our Swim Smooth camper van trying desperately hard to fill clinic places, to now selling out clinic places around the world within a couple of hours of date release. Michelle has witnessed the rapid growth that Swim Smooth has achieved in the last three years as I partnered with Adam, and, as a well-respected physiotherapist herself, is primarily responsible for my knowledge and desire to know more about the anatomy of the

to SPL. ‘Stroke Rate’ (not to be confused with stroke length) is how many strokes you take per minute, counting both arms. This is like cadence on a bicycle except with cadence you only count one leg, not both! The higher your stroke rate, the faster you are turning your arms over. Typical numbers are in the range of 35 to 110 strokes per minute (SPM) with most non-elite swimmers in the 50–65 SPM range. Traditionally it was very difficult for swimmers to control their stroke rates but with the invention of stroke beepers such as the Wetronome and the Finis Tempo Trainer Pro (see Chapter 3) this has become much easier. These beepers can be set to a given number of strokes per minute and you simply coordinate your strokes to the beep as you swim – controlling your stroke rate in this manner can be extremely beneficial to your stroke technique as we shall see in Chapter 14. Unlike stroke length, stroke rate can be easily measured in open water and this makes it the key reference for open water swimmers to monitor their strokes. Generally speaking open water swimmers use higher stroke rates with a slightly shorter stroke length than pool swimmers. This helps them punch through waves, chop and the wake from other swimmers. As we will discuss in Chapters 14 and 39 this may be a worthwhile modification to make in your stroke in this environment. --- Page 30 Text --- Some references to stroke rate on the internet and in academic papers might refer to stroke cycles per minute – one cycle being the combination of a left and right arm stroke. In this situation 30 cycles per minute is equivalent to 60 strokes per minute. Some sources also refer to cycle time in

rate on the internet and in academic papers might refer to stroke cycles per minute – one cycle being the combination of a left and right arm stroke. In this situation 30 cycles per minute is equivalent to 60 strokes per minute. Some sources also refer to cycle time in seconds (a stroke cycle taking 2.0 seconds to complete would also be the equivalent of 60 SPM). What we really like about strokes per minute is a) we are always dealing with whole numbers and not decimals and b) when using a stroke rate beeper the swimmer can coordinate each hand entry into the water with the beep which helps identify issues in symmetry between left and right. Swimming Speed is normally quoted as the time taken to cover a given distance. This could be time per 400 m or 1000 m but most commonly speed is quoted in time per 100 m swum in minutes and seconds. So 1:30/100 m means every 100 m swum is taking you one and a half minutes to complete. An elite swimmer might sprint at 0:50/100 m and slow down to 1:00–1:05/100 m over longer distances (if you can call that slow!). What we call ‘advanced’ swimmers will fall in the range of 1:10–1:30/100 m for continuous swims. ‘Intermediate’ age- group swimmers will be in the range of 1:30–2:10/100 m with beginners taking up to 3:00/100 m. The Pool Pace Clock is a special swimming clock that is well worth learning to use. It does not have a minute hand, just a double second hand coloured red in one direction and black in the other. Elite swimmers do not wear a watch when they swim, instead they use the pace clock to time all their sets – with practice you can learn to

It does not have a minute hand, just a double second hand coloured red in one direction and black in the other. Elite swimmers do not wear a watch when they swim, instead they use the pace clock to time all their sets – with practice you can learn to time any distance of swim using just the second hands of this clock. The key to doing this is knowing approximately what time you will swim for any distance. For instance, you might know that you can swim 400 m in close to eight minutes. If you set off when the red hand reaches the 12 o’clock position (jargon ‘going on the red top’) then you should finish when the red hand is near the top again. So, if you finish with the red hand on 10 seconds you swam 8:10, or on the 45 seconds, you swam 7:45. This is beneficial because many swimmers find that wearing a standard watch disrupts their ‘feel for the water’ by disturbing the water flow on your arm. Also, when swimming repetitions you can use the pace clock to set you off. For instance you could swim 100 m repetitions starting every 2:15 and so start the first on ‘black top’, the second on ‘black 15’, the third on ‘black 30’ etc. This is a simple way of swimming sets without having to look at your watch and do lots of mental arithmetic! A ‘Torpedo Push-Off’ or ‘Streamline’ is a position adopted by swimmers as they push off from the wall. This position has a very low level of drag, lower than when swimming normally. The quickest way to swim is to push off from the wall and hold this streamlined position until the speed drops to normal swimming speed and then ‘break-out’

for. Californian swimming technology company Finis is one of the most innovative companies in this area and for this reason we have tried and tested all of its products, our favourite ones of which feature prominently below. Other manufacturers making good swim gear and training aids are Speedo, TYR, Aquasphere, and Arena. Depending upon your location, you may see that some of these brands are more prominent than others. Essential Equipment 1. Bathers/Cossie/Costume/Trunks/Togs/Speedos/Budgie Smugglers – whatever you call them it’s essential to be suitably attired in the swimming pool and ocean! A well fitting swimming costume can make all the difference to how well you slip through the water. Of course you can wear whatever you like to protect your modesty but at Swim Smooth we have a preference towards brightly coloured bathers made by Funky Trunks, Aqua Diva and Speedo as they are a little bit fun and help to brighten up a cold winter’s morning! 2. Swimming Cap and Goggles – silicon swimming caps are our recommendation as they are very durable and don’t pull at your hair like the cheaper latex caps tend to. A good cap will also keep your head warm in the open water and help --- Page 34 Text --- streamline your progress. Caps and goggles are made by a range of manufacturers but our favourite goggles are made by Canadian company ‘Sable’ (www.sablewateroptics.com) as they provide a great fit, come with a variety of different nose bridges for custom modification and have excellent clarity and anti- fog properties. We recommend that female swimmers with small faces try out junior size goggles for a better fit. Goggle clarity in the open water is essential and will make you feel much more comfortable in this environment. 3. Fins/Flippers – these are excellent tools to

should roll to the other end and make a ‘toc’ sound. If you are not rotating well enough it will remain silent! 11. Swimming watches by Finis, Garmin and Swimovate – great for gadget lovers everywhere! These sophisticated devices use accelerometers to be able to tell each time you take a stroke, when you reach the end of the pool and when you turn to come back. By recording this data for subsequent review, the swimmer is able to build up a very clear picture of how well they are pacing themselves. All watches contain an algorithm to calculate a ‘SWOLF score’ which is based on the ‘swim golf’ idea that if you add the number of strokes taken in a given length to the time in seconds to complete that length, you will have an index of ‘efficiency’ with the theory being that the lower the score, the more efficient the swimmer. Specialist swimming watches allow you to review and study every lap you swam in the pool. Great for those who love a bit of analysis! --- Page 38 Text --- As you will read in the rest of this book, SWOLF scores are not always a true indication of actual swimming efficiency and for this reason Swim Smooth tend not to use this measure as it can predispose people to overly lengthening their strokes. The Garmin 910 XT watch also contains a GPS receiver, which allows you to use the watch in the open water and check how far and how straight you have swum. Not Recommended 12. Board Shorts – many novice male swimmers think that figure hugging bathers should only be worn by more serious ‘professional’ swimmers but nothing could be further from the truth! Baggy shorts add a huge amount of drag and pull

and developed highly effective coaching methods for every type of swimmer. We also work and interact with hundreds of swimming coaches around the world both in person and through our Coaches Network on the internet. Through all of this coaching experience, one thing has proven to be true time and time again: the swimmers who make the biggest improvements follow a rounded programme covering three critical areas of swimming development: 1. They develop their stroke technique in the pool using drills and visualisations specific to their individual stroke needs. 2. They consistently train their swim specific fitness (with an emphasis on the consistency). 3. They regularly practise their open water skills such as drafting, sighting and rhythm, either in the pool or in open water. We call these areas The Three Keys and they are so fundamental to the Swim Smooth philosophy that we have structured this whole book around them: Key 1: Stroke Technique Development – Chapters 5 to 23 Key 2: Swim Training – Chapters 24 to 32 Key 3: Open Water Skills – Chapters 33 to 39 You may immediately appreciate why each of these keys are important to maximise your performance, however you may be tempted to focus on each one at different times of the year (in coaching jargon we call this ‘periodisation’). Do not make this mistake. Separating them out into different periods during the year becomes a lot less effective than working on them simultaneously all year round. Combining the Three Keys When we first explain to swimmers the concept of working on these three elements at the same time, they are sometimes concerned that this is a complex thing to do or that they might not have time in their swimming week. Actually, training in this way is not as complicated or

we first explain to swimmers the concept of working on these three elements at the same time, they are sometimes concerned that this is a complex thing to do or that they might not have time in their swimming week. Actually, training in this way is not as complicated or difficult as you might imagine. Instead, the variety of challenges it --- Page 40 Text --- offers to your brain and body is great fun, really keeping you on your toes and pushing your swimming quickly forward at the same time. You will never get bored or stagnant again! PAUL: We very much follow this philosophy in the Swim Smooth squads in Perth, conducting technique, fitness and open water skills sessions (in the pool and open water) every week. Interestingly, one of the most popular sessions of the week are the harder CSS training sessions that we will explain to you in Chapter 27. We affectionately call them ‘Fresh and Fruity’ sessions, so called because of the higher intensity required in these sessions and as a way of making light of what are actually quite tough sessions. Despite Swim Smooth being renowned locally as a squad focused on developing a swimmer’s technical efficiency, these harder fitness sessions are very popular and give each swimmer a great sense of achievement afterwards. Many swimmers join our squads to improve their stroke technique and then really discover the fitness side of swimming too and benefit greatly from the training. They are not afraid of a little bit of hard work and as Captain Matthew Webb, the first man to swim the English Channel in 1875, famously said: ‘Nothing great is easy!’ To help you combine the three keys together in your training week we have developed special weekly ‘Skeleton Structures’ for you to

of a little bit of hard work and as Captain Matthew Webb, the first man to swim the English Channel in 1875, famously said: ‘Nothing great is easy!’ To help you combine the three keys together in your training week we have developed special weekly ‘Skeleton Structures’ for you to follow (Chapter 26) and also an extensive set of training sessions to slot into that structure (Appendix C). By following this training routine your swimming technique, efficiency, fitness and race skills will soon be moving forward apace. How the Three Keys Interact with Each Other One of the reasons why you need to work on all three of the keys at the same time is that the three areas interact and benefit each other – i.e. they add up to more than the sum of their individual parts. A good example of this is how fitness training benefits your stroke technique development. Many swimmers focus purely on their technique in the pool and avoid any training sets for fear they will harm their stroke technique – we affectionately call this group of swimmers ‘Technique Hermits’. Although these swimmers may make some initial progress with their swimming, they soon hit a plateau in performance beyond which they cannot progress. In fact some of these guys are so diligent that they have been repeating the same technique sessions for years with the hope that one day they will break through to better swimming. This is a great shame; such dedicated swimmers deserve much better. Professional triathlete and Ironman winner Scott Neyedli knows that it takes more than drills and a pretty stroke to allow him to swim 3.8 km in under 45 minutes. --- Page 41 Text --- Of course, the opposite is also true: many Masters swimmers focus purely on training

much better. Professional triathlete and Ironman winner Scott Neyedli knows that it takes more than drills and a pretty stroke to allow him to swim 3.8 km in under 45 minutes. --- Page 41 Text --- Of course, the opposite is also true: many Masters swimmers focus purely on training and never work on improving their stroke technique. Just as much as the Technique Hermits, this group stands to make some large improvements by following a more balanced approach to their swimming preparation from introducing structured and focused technique sessions. ADAM: If you have gone down the technique-only route yourself in the past don’t be concerned, by introducing the other two keys (training and open water skills) into your training week you will quickly start to make progress again. If you have held the belief that stroke technique is all important for a long time then it’s only natural to feel sceptical at first but judge the results objectively, are you swimming more quickly and more easily with a more balanced preparation? A second classic example of the interaction between the three keys is how open water skills benefit stroke technique development. If you exclusively focus on stroke technique, the tendency is to develop a long stroke at a slow stroke rate. You may make some progress in the pool by focusing on technique but when summer comes around and you swim in open water you would soon be left behind by swimmers with a slightly shorter faster stroke that is much more suited to this environment. By performing regular open water skills sessions (in the pool in winter) alongside your technique sessions, your stroke technique will naturally develop in the right direction to be efficient in the open water. If you are a triathlete this is especially vital for

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
good lower core control is to your stroke technique, we can easily forget about it when we swim. An excellent way to remind yourself is to use a good torpedo push-off (also known as a streamline) at the beginning of every length which involves stretching through your core. Doing this will improve the connection between your upper and lower body at the beginning of every length and help remind you to keep that connection and feeling of stretch in place for the whole lap. PAUL: Many of the triathletes who swim with us in Perth think that they don’t need the discipline of a good torpedo push-off at the beginning of every lap because they don’t get to push off in open water. Whilst this is true, they are missing out on developing their core control when swimming which is so essential to avoid fish-tailing (legs sweeping from side to side) and to keep the body high in the water. Dry Land Core Conditioning Most swimmers and triathletes have enough core strength to swim very well, it’s more a matter of coordinating and engaging the core muscles in the right way. Unless you have very poor core strength indeed it’s not normally necessary to add in additional gym classes to your training routine. Saying that, a strong core has many benefits on dry land so we wouldn’t discourage you from a good pilates or yoga class either! Time availability will always be the limiting factor for most non-professional swimmers, so the more specifically you can introduce good core control into your normal swim sessions the better. PAUL: Just to prove this point, it’s normally the gym junkies who can do hundreds of sit-ups who have the worst core control in the water! For more information on dry-land conditioning that you

visualisations will help you tune into these movements and get a good feel for them. As you work on your arm stroke under the water, particularly during the catch, don’t become frustrated if it takes a little time to click into place in your stroke. Developing a good catch is challenging and is something that elite swimmers need to constantly work --- Page 100 Text --- on and maintain in their strokes too. However, even small improvements in your catch technique will have an immediate benefit to your speed and efficiency in the water, which you will notice straight away. A High Elbow Catch and Pull-Through You might have heard or been told by a swim coach to ‘keep your elbows high’ when you swim. Sometimes this comment refers to your arm recovery over the top of the water but as we saw in Chapter 11, a classically high elbow recovery over the water is now considered less important than it used to be in swimming technique. However, during the pull-through under the water a high elbow technique is essential to create good propulsion. The reason a high elbow technique is important is that it helps you press the water in the right direction – backwards – so that you are propelled forwards. It allows you to do this not only with the hand but your forearm too. This use of the forearm is important as it increases the surface area that you are using as a paddle in the water. Here are some examples of swimmers showing classic flaws in their catch technique. Notice how our animated swimmer maintains a high elbow in all these positions with the elbow higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips throughout: Ron pushes down on the water with a

get better at it. --- Page 108 Text --- SCULL #1 Referring to the full drill description for Scull #1 in Appendix A, push off down the lap with a pull buoy between your legs and raise your head above the surface. Start sculling the water left and right in front of you changing the angle of your hand to keep a light water pressure on the palm. Make sure that your elbow is higher than your wrist and your wrist is higher than your fingertips. You may need to exaggerate this and move your hands a little lower in the water to make sure the palm is facing backwards. Scull #1 practices the position at the initial phase of the catch. Many swimming coaches talk about ‘reaching over a barrel’ or ‘reaching over and hugging a Swiss ball’ during the catch in the position you are in here. These can be very useful visualisations whilst performing Scull #1, try them out yourself. As your perform Scull #1, visualise reaching over a barrel or hugging a Swiss ball. This will help you develop the correct catch position. Sculling drills are always slow paced but a good sign that you are getting Scull #1 right is when your speed picks up noticeably and you feel your chest rising up a little in the water. Scull #1 and Overgliding A fascinating test you can try when performing Scull #1 is to move from your high elbow position into one where you drop the elbow and wrist so that your palm is facing forwards. If you are a bit of an Overglider you probably do this in your full stroke, dropping the wrist and showing the palm forwards. We call this position ‘putting on the brakes’. Overgliders tend to do this in their

the elbow and wrist so that your palm is facing forwards. If you are a bit of an Overglider you probably do this in your full stroke, dropping the wrist and showing the palm forwards. We call this position ‘putting on the brakes’. Overgliders tend to do this in their strokes without realising it as they strongly emphasise the extension forwards and add a glide to their strokes. You’ll notice when dropping the elbow and wrist in this position when sculling that you immediately stop moving forwards and may even start to move backwards! This goes to show how harmful Overgliding is for your stroke efficiency. You will also feel more water pressure on the palm of the hand in this position, which could make you think that you are getting a good catch in your full stroke. Of course, to be efficient you need to be pressing the water backwards, not forwards and away from you! --- Page 109 Text --- DOGGY PADDLE PAUL: Doggy Paddle drill is probably the oldest drill in the swimming world, it’s something I can recall doing at age six in the pool! It may be a very old drill but it’s great for developing your catch technique; in fact it’s the perfect drill to use if you have a tendency to catch or pull through with a very straight arm under the water. Referring to the description in Appendix A, perform the Doggy Paddle drill using a pull buoy starting off with your head above the surface. Imagine there’s a rope under the water, which you are moving over about 50cm or 2ft beneath the surface, and as you perform the drill aim to pull straight down that rope. Pull-through all the way to your hip and emphasise your body roll, the drill’s

head above the surface. Imagine there’s a rope under the water, which you are moving over about 50cm or 2ft beneath the surface, and as you perform the drill aim to pull straight down that rope. Pull-through all the way to your hip and emphasise your body roll, the drill’s mantra is ‘reach and roll’! Recovering the hands back under the water will feel strange at first, don’t worry too much about this, simply bring them through as smoothly as you can with a flat hand, fingers first. The focus of the drill should be in bending your elbow early in front of your head and getting over the top of the movement to press the water backwards using your hand and forearm as paddles. If you struggle with this experiment try moving a little deeper with the hands to help you get over the top of the stroke. Once you have got underway with Doggy Paddle you can drop your head down into the water and watch your movements in action. Keep it smooth and always in motion – either extending forwards, catching the water or pressing it backwards. No dead spots please and no showing the palm of the hand forwards! Transition into full-stroke swimming and continue the visualisation of pulling down a rope under your body, bend that elbow early in front of your head just like in the drill itself. You should find you pull through with a nice rhythm and tempo to the stroke. If you are an advanced swimmer you can get up quite a speed with Doggy Paddle! SCULL #2 Similar to Scull #1, this drill focuses on a slightly later point in the stroke as you are entering the pull phase under the head. It is ideal for swimmers who pull through

you are an advanced swimmer you can get up quite a speed with Doggy Paddle! SCULL #2 Similar to Scull #1, this drill focuses on a slightly later point in the stroke as you are entering the pull phase under the head. It is ideal for swimmers who pull through with a straight arm under the body as it emphasises a bent elbow position at this point of the stroke. During Scull #2, scull the water lightly by moving the hands slightly wider than the body and on the way in, nearly meeting in the middle. Keep your elbows in a fixed position and perform the sculling motion with a ‘mixing’ action from the elbows down. This is a harder drill than Scull #1 as it offers you less support to keep your head up in the water. When you transition into full-stroke swimming, focus on pulling through smoothly under the head with an elbow bend at approximately 100° to 120° --- Page 110 Text --- SMILEY FACE VISUALISATION The key to a successful catch and pull is to press the water back behind you through the whole arm stroke. Here is a simple way to visualise this as you swim: imagine someone’s drawn a smiley face on the palm of your hand and as you swim you’ve got to show that face back to the wall behind you at all times. This might sound slightly childish but it is a very effective way to focus you on a good pull- through technique. Imagine someone’s drawn a smiley face on the palm of your hand and as you swim show the face back to the wall behind you. Integrating Catch Drills into a Set Sculling and Doggy Paddle drills are best followed immediately by full-stroke swimming to transfer the movements

hand as you do this and it is quite possible you are misinterpreting that pressure as a good catch. The irony is that as you improve your catch and start pressing the water backwards, you will feel less pressure on the palm as you are no longer changing the water’s direction. As you improve your propulsive technique it’s easy to feel the reduced pressure on the palm and think ‘this can’t be right, a good catch should feel strong and solid’ and so return to your old stroke technique. This is one of the reasons why developing a good catch is so elusive for many swimmers. A good catch should allow you to feel a firm but not forced connection with the water. Fingers Spread or Together? Perhaps the most common question we are asked by swimmers about the catch phase of the stroke is how they should hold their fingers: should they be together or wide apart? For 95% of swimmers we recommend holding your fingers lightly together with no gaps between them. This is quite easy to coordinate and leaves you able to focus on the more important issues in your stroke technique. Elite swimmers do hold their fingers ever so slightly apart – enough to slip a few sheets of paper between but nothing more. This increases the effective surface area of their hands very slightly, however this is a very fine motor skill. Let the fingers move any wider and water starts slipping through the gaps and a lot of propulsion is lost. Holding your fingers lightly together will allow you to swim very quickly and efficiently without the risks of slipping by trying to hold them slightly apart. The Exit at the Rear of the Stroke The push phase at the back of the stroke

as this will cause the arm to slip through with little purchase. After the arm has finished extending, a good catch starts without delay as this gives the swimmer time to engage with the water in a high elbow position in front of the head. The drills in this section (and The Doggy Paddle Drill from the catch mechanics section) are a great way to develop this fluid catch technique. --- Page 114 Text --- ADAM: If you like numbers (like me!) here’s a quick example to reinforce this point. Say you swim at 55 strokes per minute (SPM) at the moment with a poor catch technique. If you were to improve your catch such that you took just 0.2 seconds less to perform it (less than the blink of an eye!) then your stroke rate would lift to 60 SPM. This is a significant lift in stroke rate and one that would greatly benefit your speed and efficiency The good news here is that this wouldn’t feel harder to do as you would be working with the water rather than against it. For most swimmers it actually feels easier to swim at a higher tempo once they’ve improved their catch technique. Check out Chapter 15 for some recent research demonstrating this point. Overgliding and Catch Timing As we’ll see in Chapter 21, an Overglider is a type of swimmer who tries to swim with an extended glide phase at the front of their stroke. This adds a large dead spot or pause in their stroke timing. Overgliders are normally diligent swimmers who have worked hard on reducing their drag profile in the water but have become frustrated (and often a little confused) by why they are not swimming faster than they are.

spot or pause in their stroke timing. Overgliders are normally diligent swimmers who have worked hard on reducing their drag profile in the water but have become frustrated (and often a little confused) by why they are not swimming faster than they are. PAUL: Overgliders have become extremely common around the world as many coaching programmes actively encourage adding a deliberate pause-and-glide into the stroke, often saying the swimmer should be ‘patient’ with their catch to encourage the pause before starting it. As we’ll discuss in Chapter 15 (Science of Swimming) and Chapter 17 (Swim Types), teaching swimmers to over-glide is something that myself and the other Swim Smooth coaches fundamentally disagree with as it stops swimmers reaching their true potential in the water. The overall timing between an Overglider and an elite swimmer is similar but the elite swimmer does not actually pause as they extend forwards – they are constantly in motion either entering the water, extending forwards or catching the water. By introducing a dead spot to their stroke the Overglider is then forced to hurry their catch to restart their stroke again. This hurried catch makes it very hard to engage with the water without slipping through it. This is the main difference between an Overglider’s stroke and a Smooth’s stroke (Chapter 23) – other than the fact that the Smooth swims at twice the speed! If you are an Overglider the path to improving your swimming is to remove the dead spot from your stroke by developing an improved catch technique. This will give you a more fluid stroke and will also lift your stroke rate slightly, giving your swimming a renewed sense of rhythm. --- Page 115 Text --- UNCO DRILL The Unco drill is described fully in Appendix A and is a one-arm

stroke rate precisely. The Finis Tempo Trainer Pro sits under your swim cap and beeps a steady stroke rhythm to you. These stroke beepers are particularly useful for helping you subtly raise or lower your stroke rate. If you have a tendency to fight the water with a large crossover in your stroke then to help you become straighter and more aligned in the water it’s worthwhile lowering your natural stroke rate by 3–5 SPM. For an Overglider who is working on removing the dead spot from their stroke it’s more appropriate to lift your stroke rate by 3–5 SPM. PAUL: Judging your stroke rate whilst you are swimming can be quite difficult without a Wetronome or Tempo Trainer to refer to. They are fantastic little devices and come highly recommended by the Swim Smooth team. You can find out more about them at www.swimsmooth.com/wetronome and www.swimsmooth.com/tempotrainer The Stroke Rate Ramp Test A ramp test uses a stroke rate beeper to take you through a range of stroke rates in turn. You might start 10 SPM slower than your natural stroke rate and end up 15–20 SPM higher. You will need a friend or coach to help you with the test and record the results as you go, including your strokes per length, your lap times and how hard each stroke rate felt. The test helps you find sweet-spots in your stroke rate where the movements start to click together into good timing. At these points you will be moving more quickly and easily than you otherwise would. Very often you will find two sweet-spots, one at a steady pace and one at a faster race-pace. We highly recommend running through a ramp test after working on your stroke to help ‘bed in’ the changes. Find out how to run

Find out how to run the test, how to analyse the results and see a video example at: www.swimsmooth.com/ramptest. --- Page 117 Text --- CHAPTER 14 Stroke Rate Development Balancing Stroke Rate and Stroke Length This chapter is a special feature on the methods required to increase stroke rate, this is an area that Overgliders need to work on and to some extent Smooths too if they are looking to make a successful transition to racing in open water. However, it is important to emphasise here that not all swimmers need to lift their stroke rate – some need to be lengthening out their stroke instead (e.g. Arnies) and in this case it is often advisable to lower stroke rate a little to help achieve this. Fundamentally, the speed you move through the water is a combination of the length of your stroke and your stroke rate. We can use a simple equation to show this: swimming speed = stroke length × stroke rate At either extreme a swimmer becomes inefficient: with a low stroke rate you overglide and lose too much speed; increase stroke rate too high and you start to fight the water. The key to becoming an efficient swimmer is to find the sweet-spot in the middle where your stroke movements and stroke rhythm click into perfect harmony. This exact point varies significantly from swimmer to swimmer depending on your build, fitness and individual stroke style. The Swim Type stroke correction processes in Appendix B are designed to lower or raise your

the sweet-spot in the middle where your stroke movements and stroke rhythm click into perfect harmony. This exact point varies significantly from swimmer to swimmer depending on your build, fitness and individual stroke style. The Swim Type stroke correction processes in Appendix B are designed to lower or raise your stroke rate as appropriate and find this efficiency ‘sweet spot’ in your stroke. ADAM: Take a look ahead to Figure 14.13 The Swim Smooth Stroke Rate Chart later in this chapter, which highlights how some swimmers are over-revving and fighting the water (the red zone) while others are adding a large dead spot to their timing (the blue zone). For swimmers in the blue zone, raising stroke rate presents a difficult challenge especially if they have a heavily imprinted dead spot in their stroke timing. This chapter is dedicated to helping those swimmers lift their stroke rate. Stroke Rate and Open Water Swimming As we shall discuss later in Chapter 33, swimming in open water is very different from the pool. The disturbed water from waves, chop and the wake from other swimmers means that any dead spots or pauses in your stroke leave you vulnerable to being stalled completely between strokes. For this reason, the trade-off between stroke length and --- Page 118 Text --- stroke rate is always shifted towards shorter faster strokes in open water. If you feel the need to lift your stroke rate in open water then use the advice in this chapter to do that. Lifting Stroke Rate In a nutshell, the way to lift stroke rate is to remove dead spots or pauses from the stroke timing and so get into the catch phase a little sooner. However, many swimmers struggle to raise their stroke rate without significantly increasing their level of effort.

that. Lifting Stroke Rate In a nutshell, the way to lift stroke rate is to remove dead spots or pauses from the stroke timing and so get into the catch phase a little sooner. However, many swimmers struggle to raise their stroke rate without significantly increasing their level of effort. There are two main reasons for this: 1. The dead spot in their stroke timing is very imprinted and hard to remove. When trying to lift stroke rate, the swimmer increases the speed of every other movement of the stroke but keeps the dead spot in place. This increases effort levels but does not improve efficiency. 2. The swimmer has a large press downward on the water during the catch phase of the stroke. This acts to lift the front end of the body upwards and sink the legs. As the swimmer tries to increase stroke rate they press down harder on the water and so sink the legs, increasing drag. This increase in drag offsets any gains in efficiency from a more continuous stroke. Such swimmers often feel their swimming is very ‘one paced’ – increasing effort does not increase their speed very much at all. The key to lifting your stroke rate is twofold: 1. Improve the timing of your stroke so that you remove the glide and dead spot whilst keeping all the other stroke elements the same speed. This will improve efficiency with very little, if any, increase in effort. As you swim the sensation here will be to keep the lead hand constantly in motion, either extending forwards, catching the water or pressing it backwards. Never pausing and gliding! 2. Improve your catch mechanics so that you press the water backwards, not downward. This will be a quicker action as water is heavy and takes

will be to keep the lead hand constantly in motion, either extending forwards, catching the water or pressing it backwards. Never pausing and gliding! 2. Improve your catch mechanics so that you press the water backwards, not downward. This will be a quicker action as water is heavy and takes time to change its direction. By pressing it backwards you are helping the water in the direction it is already travelling relative to you and this will take less time – thereby increasing stroke rate all by itself. As effort is increased, your stroke rate will lift further as the downward press and resultant drag has been removed. Age-group swimmer Paul (top) is about to press down on the water with a straight arm in comparison to elite open water swimmer Mel Benson (bottom) who has bent her elbow and is pressing water backwards. --- Page 119 Text --- To develop your catch mechanics and remove your dead spot follow the process in Chapter 13 and also the relevant Swim Type stroke correction process in Appendix B. You Are Not Looking to Shorten the Stroke It is very important to appreciate that by lifting stroke rate you are not shortening the stroke at all, you are still starting from the front of the stroke at full extension and finishing at the thigh at the rear. Instead of shortening the stroke you are simply looking to remove the delay pre-catch. In Figure 14.12 there are some photos of elite open water swimmer Melissa Benson swimming at around 100 strokes per minute – if you have ever used a stroke rate beeper you will know this is a very high stroke rate! Whilst it is unlikely you will want such a high stroke rate yourself, even in this extreme example you can

swimmer Melissa Benson swimming at around 100 strokes per minute – if you have ever used a stroke rate beeper you will know this is a very high stroke rate! Whilst it is unlikely you will want such a high stroke rate yourself, even in this extreme example you can clearly see Mel is not shortening her stroke, she is starting at full reach and completing the stroke at the thigh. FIGURE 14.12 Elite swimmer Mel Benson has a very high stroke rate but still uses her full reach from full extension (1) to the finishing at the thigh (2). --- Page 120 Text --- PAUL: I took a swimmer for a video analysis session in late 2010 who I often refer to when discussing the balance between stroke rate and stroke length, and the perils of over-gliding. This swimmer told me that he couldn’t understand why he could swim a single 50 m lap in 28 strokes (which he added was ‘better than Ian Thorpe’) but was not able to break 25 minutes for 1000 m. He also complained of being fatigued at the end of each lap and needing a rest. What was most confusing was that this guy was tall, had a good swimmer’s build and had been swimming four times per week for over five years and wasn’t seeing any improvement – in fact he told me he was actually getting slower. What he didn’t appreciate at that point was that whilst his stroke was very long, his stroke rate was an incredibly slow 33 strokes per minute. He paused for over a second at the front of the stroke and said he enjoyed this pause to glide as it was giving him a ‘rest’. Unfortunately this ‘rest’ was causing him to decelerate to a near

long, his stroke rate was an incredibly slow 33 strokes per minute. He paused for over a second at the front of the stroke and said he enjoyed this pause to glide as it was giving him a ‘rest’. Unfortunately this ‘rest’ was causing him to decelerate to a near stop between strokes and so causing him to start to sink in the water. He was shocked when he saw just how badly this was affecting his body position – something he thought must have been OK from all the balance drills he had been working on. Whilst we often look at swimmers like Ian Thorpe and perceive a long, slow stroke, the reality is that Thorpe swam at 72 to 76 SPM – well over twice that of my extreme Overglider example. Clearly this guy was not better than Ian Thorpe despite his stroke being longer – something we have all been told in the past is the key measure of swimming efficiency. The truth is that stroke length is only part of the full picture and neither stroke length nor stroke rate should ever be taken in isolation. Dead spots and Stroke Rate in Numbers Let’s look at the three swimmers who need to lift their stroke rate in Table 14.2. These numbers are very typical and if you are an Overglider yourself, you will have similar figures. --- Page 121 Text --- Table 14.2 Typical results of Overgliders reducing the dead spot in their stroke showing the resultant increase in stroke rate. On the left-hand side we see the stroke rate of the swimmers and the length of their dead spot in seconds. The slight Overglider has a dead spot or overglide lasting around 0.3 seconds, the classic Overglider around 0.5 seconds and the extreme Overglider a

resultant increase in stroke rate. On the left-hand side we see the stroke rate of the swimmers and the length of their dead spot in seconds. The slight Overglider has a dead spot or overglide lasting around 0.3 seconds, the classic Overglider around 0.5 seconds and the extreme Overglider a full second! In comparison a classic Smooth swimmer would have around 0.1–0.15 seconds between one stroke finishing at the rear and the next one starting at the front. A refined Swinger would have zero delay or even an overlap, starting the stroke at the front before the stroke at the rear finishes. In the right-hand column we show a target reduction in dead spot, this is the initial reduction we might aim for when working with this swimmer in a one-to-one coaching situation. In the far right-hand column we calculate the resultant stroke rate if nothing else changes in the stroke but the shortening of the dead spot. We can see that each of the swimmers gains between five and seven strokes per minute by reducing the dead spot in their strokes alone, a very noticeable improvement which you will feel as a real increase in your stroke rhythm. Dropping the wrist and elbow and pushing forwards adds a big pause to the stroke, lowering your stroke rate. ADAM: If you own a Wetronome or a Finis Tempo Trainer Pro, go through the process of improving your catch technique and reducing the dead spot in your stroke. Then use the beeper to return to your old stroke rate – it is amazing how slow it will feel.

This reduction will give them time to remove crossovers from their stroke and lengthen things out. If you are using a Wetronome or Finis Tempo Trainer Pro you can do this by lowering your stroke rate by 3–5 SPM. This may not sound like a large change but you will immediately notice the extra time this gives you to work on your alignment in the water. In time you can lift your stroke rate back up again and combine that straighter stroke with a faster stroke rate to gain a real increase in speed. For more details on this process see the Arnie and Swinger guides in Chapters 18 and 22. Finding Your Current Stroke Rate There are several ways to do this. The easiest is to use a Wetronome or Finis Tempo Trainer Pro and adjust it up or down until it feels about normal for you. The second is to have a friend or coach measure your stroke rate using a specialist stop watch such as the Finis 3X-100 M; if you are a coach yourself one of these watches is a

Pro and adjust it up or down until it feels about normal for you. The second is to have a friend or coach measure your stroke rate using a specialist stop watch such as the Finis 3X-100 M; if you are a coach yourself one of these watches is a great investment in your coaching. The third way is to have a friend use a normal stop watch and time how long you take to perform ten strokes (counting both arms), then divide 600 by that number. So if you take 12 seconds for 10 strokes, 600 / 12 = 50 strokes per minute. The Swim Smooth Stroke Rate Chart A useful tool to help you assess your stroke rate is our stroke rate chart, shown in Figure 14.13. The chart shows swimmer speed against stroke rate – it covers the whole range of swimmers from beginners up to elite distance swimmers. The chart was developed from analysing hundreds of swimmers’ strokes in comparison to their speed and stroke rate. FIGURE 14.13 The Swim Smooth Stroke Rate Chart. --- Page 123 Text --- The chart contains three zones: the first is the blue zone, which shows where the swimmer’s stroke rate is too low – normally the result of an overglide in their stroke timing. The second zone is the red zone where a swimmer is fighting the water, resulting in a short fast stroke. The white zone is the ‘sweet spot’ indicating a good trade-off between stroke length and rate. Use the chart to assess your swimming and decide how you need to progress things. You can find an interactive version of the chart on our website at www.swimsmooth.com/strokerate.

performed. There is a saying that ‘Google never forgets’ and never was it so true as for swimming advice! Unfortunately by searching for a term such as ‘swimming technique’ on Google you will find lots of contradictory advice in videos and on discussion forums, some of which is very out of date and badly advised for the majority of swimmers. ADAM: This section is a little more technical than the rest of the book as we explain the background behind our coaching methods from a scientific perspective. If you enjoy a little technical discussion and analysis then you will find this fascinating but don’t worry if you don’t – you can safely skip this chapter, it won’t harm your swimming to do so. In this section we are going to take a close look at the concept of efficiency in swimming, why it is important to be an efficient swimmer and how different aspects of your stroke affect it. We are also going to clear up many of those misconceptions from the internet and other sources along the way. Elite swimmer Rhys Mainstone has a very efficient and fast stroke which lets him swim around 1:10 / 100 m at a steady pace. How can he move so quickly? Why Efficiency is So Important Elite pool and open water swimmers have a great stroke technique, which is the dominant reason why they move so quickly through the water. In fact, an elite swimmer’s stroke is so effective that when swimming at an easy pace they move more --- Page 125 Text --- quickly than most ‘normal’ swimmers can sprint – amazing! What’s their secret? It comes down to the efficiency of their strokes. How fast you move through the water is down to a combination of the efficiency of your

at an easy pace they move more --- Page 125 Text --- quickly than most ‘normal’ swimmers can sprint – amazing! What’s their secret? It comes down to the efficiency of their strokes. How fast you move through the water is down to a combination of the efficiency of your stroke and how hard you are working. Let’s look at this on an ‘efficiency plot’ as shown in Figure 15.14. On the x axis we will put your physical effort (we could measure this as oxygen uptake or perhaps heart rate) and on the y axis your speed. Any given swimmer with a fixed level of efficiency will make a distinct curve on the graph. The relationship between effort and speed is fixed for the swimmer; as you increase your effort you move more quickly but it’s a case of diminishing returns as drag of the water increases quickly, creating the curved line. FIGURE 15.14 Efficiency plot for a swimmer of fixed efficiency1. Now let’s introduce two other swimmers, one who is less efficient and one who is more, as shown in Figure 15.15. FIGURE 15.15 Efficiency plot of three swimmers of wide ranging ability. Beginner, intermediate and elite swimmers have increasing levels of fitness respectively and so can sustain higher work rates. --- OCR from Page 125 Image 1 --- Swimming speed eDparrnmer work pote: ‘affort’ --- Page 126 Text --- Our elite swimmer shown with the green line has superior stroke technique whilst the beginner swimmer shown by the red line has a relatively poor stroke.

the red line has a relatively poor stroke. Notice how the efficiency effect works – it moves the whole line up and down, i.e. efficiency benefits you at all speeds whether going at an easy pace, moderate or hard. This is an interesting insight all by itself as it tells us that if you are efficient you should also be pretty fast. You cannot be a ‘slow but efficient swimmer’ as some people believe — really there is no such thing. If we had two different swimmers with the same stroke efficiency then their lines would be over the top of each other. In a race the fitter swimmer would win as they could sustain a higher level of effort but if they had the same fitness they would swim at the same speed. ADAM: Last year I was filming Olympic swimmer Jono Van Hazel and he was zooming up and down the pool very quickly with his super efficient stroke. As an experiment I asked him to slow down from the speed he was doing, around 1:10 /100 m down to 1:40 /100 m pace. The fascinating thing was that he actually couldn’t swim that speed without disrupting his stroke technique. He had to change his stroke and become less efficient by adding a pause and glide to the stroke. In terms of our efficiency graph, he couldn’t slow down enough just by lowering his effort, he had to hurt his stroke technique and so jump down to one of the lower efficiency lines to swim ‘as slowly’ as 1:40 per 100 m! PAUL: Don’t worry if you’re struggling to understand this graph and the curved lines, this is the most technical we’re going to get in this book!

of the lower efficiency lines to swim ‘as slowly’ as 1:40 per 100 m! PAUL: Don’t worry if you’re struggling to understand this graph and the curved lines, this is the most technical we’re going to get in this book! The important message to take away from this section is that a good stroke technique makes you an efficient swimmer and that’s what we should all be aiming for as it will make your swimming fast and feel much easier too. Efficiency and the Three Keys So if swimming efficiency is so important, does that mean that you should focus on stroke technique development in the pool and nothing else in your swimming preparation? Unfortunately not, for two reasons: --- OCR from Page 126 Image 1 --- Swimming speed \ eMirmrumer werk rate: ‘afford increasing swimming efficiency — alite swimmer — intermediate swimmer — beginner swimmer --- Page 127 Text --- 1. As you fatigue you cannot sustain a good stroke technique, the stroke becomes shorter as you tire because you cannot finish the back of the stroke properly. This shorter stroke reduces your body roll and so the arms start to carry lower over the surface giving you that feeling of fighting the water or that your stroke is ‘falling apart’. For swimmers with poor fitness this deterioration in efficiency can happen very quickly after only 100 m or 200 m of swimming. To be an efficient swimmer you need to have good swim-specific fitness to sustain good stroke technique. 2. As we shall discuss in Chapter 33, your stroke efficiency is highly dependent on the water conditions you are swimming in. A longer stroke style suffers a large drop in efficiency in open water as it is more prone to being stalled by small waves and chop, after

technique. 2. As we shall discuss in Chapter 33, your stroke efficiency is highly dependent on the water conditions you are swimming in. A longer stroke style suffers a large drop in efficiency in open water as it is more prone to being stalled by small waves and chop, after which the swimmer needs to put in additional effort to accelerate again. To race well in open water it’s necessary to develop a technique that suits that environment and not simply focus on an efficient pool stroke. To be an efficient swimmer you need to have a stroke that is efficient in your race environment. Navigation and drafting skills are also critical for racing well in open water and need to be given a portion of your training time too. From the perspective of our efficiency graphs in Figures 15.14 and 15.15, the early onset of fatigue from poor fitness or using a stroke not suited to open water will drop you down onto a lower line. This is the fundamental understanding behind our ‘Three Keys’, to be an efficient and fast swimmer you need: Key 1: An efficient stroke technique with low drag and high propulsion levels. Key 2: Good fitness levels to sustain your swimming effort with good stroke technique. Key 3: Good open water skills, to adapt your stroke to the open water. Efficiency and Low Drag The term ‘efficiency’ is very commonly discussed by swimmers and triathletes in relation to swimming and most understand that to be a good swimmer you need an efficient stroke technique. However, many swimmers define an efficient stroke to be one that has low levels of drag; whilst this is partly the case it is a long way from the full story and trying to lower their drag at all costs

already have low drag and need to work more on their propulsion as a priority and vice versa. In the Swim Types section in Chapters 17 to 23 we’ll give you some specific advice on this for your individual swimming. ADAM: A good reason to work on your propulsive technique, even as a novice swimmer, is that a poor technique can actually harm your body position and create drag. Many swimmers overly focusing on drag reduction introduce knock-on problems into their stroke technique, which actually increase drag again. There’s no need to go to the extremes when you develop your swimming, keep a mix of stroke work focusing on propulsion and lowering drag and you’ll be on the best path to developing a very efficient stroke. Stroke Length vs. Stroke Rate The speed at which you move through the water is a combination of the length of your stroke (metres) and the rate of your stroke (strokes per minute): swimming speed = stroke length × stroke rate In cycling terms, this is equivalent to the gear and cadence you are using – increase either and you move more quickly. To become faster you need to either increase your stroke length or stroke rate, or both. How you should go about doing this is a controversial area of swimming coaching. As we shall see on the next page, Swim --- Page 129 Text --- Smooth strongly believe that you need to maintain the right trade-off between these two elements to be a fast and efficient swimmer. The exact balance you strike between the two will depend on your build, experience, skill level and natural stroke style. Efficiency and Stroke Length In the early 1990s a movement developed in swimming promoting the idea that all swimmers should look to maximise the length

of the refined Swinger style (see Chapter 22). 2. Great swimmers that were observed with long strokes were not achieving their stroke length through gliding, they were achieving it through low drag and great propulsion (see below). Video analysis of these swimmers shows that the gap between one stroke finishing at the rear and the next starting at the front is between 0 and 0.15 seconds [2]. For Overgliders with an artificial glide, this gap is typically 0.5 to 1.0 seconds. 3. Elite open water swimmers and triathletes use a shorter faster stroke style that helps them punch through disturbed water from other swimmers in close proximity. Our key message here is that different styles of stroke suit different swimmers – a long stroke may suit you and you will be very efficient performing it, or a slightly shorter punchier style may be more efficient for you. Take an individual approach to your swimming and you stand a much greater chance of swimming success. Making a Stroke Longer There are three ways to make a stroke longer: --- Page 130 Text --- 1. Reduce drag so that you slip through the water more easily. 2. Increase propulsion so that each stroke pushes you further. 3. Introduce an extended glide to elongate each stroke. The first two are excellent ways to lengthen your stroke – they are the result of good stroke technique having low drag and high levels of propulsive efficiency, which will make you more efficient. The problem with the last way, gliding, is that it is an artificial way to lengthen the stroke and does not make you more efficient for three major reasons: 1. Whilst overgliding you decelerate in the water and then have to re-accelerate on the next stroke, which is hard work. 2. This is

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
punchy style of stroke with a higher stroke rate. Both of these styles are very efficient. In fact the longer-smoother style tends to be used by sprinters and middle distance athletes whilst the Swinger style is used predominantly by distance swimmers from 800 m and up, especially in the open water. This is the opposite of what most swimmers would think, as they would consider the longer stroke more efficient and therefore more suited to distance swimming. This simply highlights that the refined-Swinger style has been misunderstood (and under- appreciated!) by swimmers and coaches for so long; it is in fact an extremely efficient stroke style and the superior style in open water. Choosing the Right Trade-Off Between Stroke Length and Stroke Rate So should you chase a particular stroke count per length? Probably not – it rarely helps to do so. Instead, use the Stroke Technique sections of this book (Key 1) to reduce your drag, increase your propulsion and improve your stroke rhythm. The end result will be --- Page 132 Text --- the right stroke length for your given build, height, arm length, experience level and natural style. Once you have developed your stroke you can then refine things a little further using the Stroke Rate Ramp test, which we described at the end of Chapter 13. This will help you determine the right stroke rate for you where all the elements of your stroke ‘click’ together. If you feel that you need to increase or decrease your stroke rate, refer to Chapter 14 where we took a close look at the process of doing so. References 1. Toussaint, H. M. 2010.

vividly recall as a 12-year-old my squad coach telling me that he would bring his huge 1980s Betacam system down to the pool to film me and show me how I might refine my stroke but alas this never happened. However, the idea was sown and as soon as I commenced my Sport and Exercise Science degree course, I was keen to combine my sports biomechanics studies with my love for swimming and coaching through the use of video analysis. Over the last 14 years I have used a vast range of video recording equipment, computer hardware and analysis software to analyse the strokes of thousands of swimmers around the world but never has it been so easy and relatively inexpensive for you to do this yourself. We are hoping that you will combine the new knowledge gained from this book with the tools you already might have at hand to video yourself swimming and see what you are doing in the water. After identifying what you need to do to improve your stroke you can then select the right Swim Type process to follow and take some big strides forward in your technique. Our best advice is to seek expert tuition from a good coach but if cost, time and geographical issues prevent you from doing so, conducting your own analysis is the next best thing and will help you avoid the statement that we hear most often from swimmers: ‘I know what I should be doing but I don’t know what I’m actually doing or how to improve it!’ Please note: in most pools around the world strict regulations make it is essential to have prior permission to use any sort of recording equipment.

Always ask permission first, in many cases it may only be possible in a private booking or club session. Camera Hardware If you are going to the trouble of filming your stroke we highly recommend using a camera that will allow you to film below the water as well as above. Being able to see what you look like under the water is incredibly beneficial, above the water the distorting properties of the surface can give a very deceptive view. In fact, it is fair to say that the view from above water is normally much more flattering than that seen from below the surface. Technology is constantly evolving but at the time of writing the following list of camera systems gives you an idea of the options and costs involved (also see Figure 16.16).

Most of these cameras will have either a removable memory card or have a sync feature to be able to transfer your recorded video images to a computer for playback. Computer Hardware If you are planning to purchase a video camera specifically for filming your swimming, ensure that your computer is capable of playing the video files that the camera produces. Most computers purchased since 2007 should not have a problem playing files from these types of cameras but it is always worth checking, especially for those cameras with high definition recording capacities. In some cases you may need to install a video codec on your computer but these codecs are normally supplied on a disk with the camera. --- Page 135 Text --- Computer Software Nearly every modern computer will have a basic media player pre-installed that will play your video clips and pause them at interesting points, e.g. Windows Media Player on a PC and QuickTime Player on a Mac. Some media players have more advanced capabilities like slow motion playback or even frame-by-frame motion, which can come in very handy when viewing your video files: Kinovea (www.kinovea.org) is a great piece of free PC software that allows you to analyse your swim stroke in more detail. It includes advanced features like side-by-side comparisons, angle measurements, stopwatches and frame-by-frame slow motion. At the time of writing, HD video playback is a little stuttery with Kinovea at full speed but the software is constantly being developed and as it is free it is well worth trying on your PC.

physical attributes e.g. height, strength, gender, natural buoyancy. The starting point of the swimmer is ignored and so the coaching is never tailored to their individual needs. As a consequence their rate of progress is dramatically slowed or stops completely. --- Page 142 Text --- No account is taken of the environment in which the swimmer is racing and the importance of tailoring the swimmer’s stroke technique to those conditions. e.g. pool versus open water and wetsuit versus non-wetsuit swimming. Our Swim Types system is a way of taking a much more individual approach to your swimming: Swim Types gives you the option of two ideal stroke styles to head towards, one of which will suit your physical make-up and personality. Your current stroke technique is recognised and a tailored development path is set for you, allowing you to take rapid steps forward. The system shows you how differing styles suit different race environments and helps you develop your stroke to excel in those conditions. This is not just about maximum performance, the right stroke style will make things much more comfortable and enjoyable too. Swim Types has been used internally by Swim Smooth coaches since 2008 but since the website www.swimtypes.com was launched in 2010, it has been used directly by swimmers with hundreds of thousands of followers from around the world visiting the site and using the system. The Development of Swim Types The Swim Types system is Paul Newsome’s brainchild, here he takes a look back at the thinking behind the system and how it was created: --- Page 143 Text --- PAUL: Coming from a competitive swimming background as a kid growing up in the UK, I always found it fascinating to see how different body types and builds gravitated towards each of the four competitive

enough to stick with the sport when many of my fellow swimmers ‘retired’ in their mid-teens. Proudly representing Great Britain in 2000. --- Page 144 Text --- There was never any doubt in my mind that the one thing that I wanted to do after completing my Sports Science degree at Bath University was to coach swimming and triathlon. I wanted to work primarily with adult age-group athletes of limited swimming experience and put my biomechanics knowledge and video analysis skills to best use by helping these swimmers improve their efficiency in the water. As it turned out everything fell into place a little sooner than I thought it might. Whilst on a backpacking trip in 2002 (complete with long, bleached-blonde hair and hippy clothing) I found myself in sunny Perth and was offered a job as the Head Coach for the largest triathlon club in Western Australia. The Challenge Stadium Aquatic Centre was to be my base and with three 50 m pools all in one giant complex, what a playground this was! Having 24 / 7 access to some of the world’s best swimming facilities, and with a seemingly endless demand for my video analysis and stroke correction services, I started to build up a big library of experience. Whilst being on the receiving end of a bit of banter from the locals for being a ‘pommie’ teaching Australians to swim, I worked with a huge range of swimmers from those just getting started in the sport to those winning triathlon and open water competitions.

O”dIW€6 --- Page 145 Text --- When you are fortunate enough to work full-time with thousands of swimmers of varying ability you start to notice trends in the way people move in the water. Being of an inquisitive and scientific mind, I started cross- referencing some of the most major faults within people’s strokes against their body-type, build, gender and swimming background. Was there any link between a swimmer’s inefficiency in the water and their physical make-up? Was I giving similar instruction to certain types of swimmers but giving differing advice to others – even if this advice seemed to contradict what I was telling the first group? The world view within swimming at this time was that everyone should be taught to fit a single mould, irrespective of physical build or background. One of the strongest notions was that if you could make your stroke as long as is physically possible by reducing the number of strokes you took per lap, then you’d supposedly become ever more efficient. But how long is long, and is this the same number of strokes for everyone irrespective of their height and arm length? Aiming for less than 40 strokes per 50 m seemed to be the hallowed goal of swimmers and coaches; after all Ian Thorpe and Alexander Popov were reputedly taking fewer strokes than any of their contemporaries and looked so graceful in the process. Swimmers would be taught to do endless technique sets in the pool trying to reduce the number of strokes taken per length with those producing the lowest numbers being praised and those over the average being rejected as failing to be efficient, despite how

theoreticians seemed to be looking past those swimmers excelling in events longer than 400 m in the pool and open water when they wrote their manuals on how all of us should aim to swim. Enter Shelley Taylor-Smith, seven times World Cup marathon swimming champion and open water specialist from Perth. In 1991 Shelley was ranked number one in the world for women and men in marathon swimming events and in the same year she won the 25 km open water event at the World Aquatics Championships in the Swan River in Perth. In no other endurance sporting event would a woman out-perform the men and yet here was Shelley doing just that, breaking all the rules. Not only was Shelley breaking the gender rules, she was also breaking the stroke rules too! At 1.65 m / 5′ 5″ Shelley wasn’t able to swim with less than 40 strokes per 50 m in the pool as most of the guys would do, instead she would take around 52 strokes. Shelley would generate her speed by matching this stroke length with a very fast stroke rate around 90 strokes per minute. For many such a high stroke rate with so many strokes per length would have been laughed off as inefficient but here was one of the world’s best ever distance swimmers doing just that, winning world championship after world championship and often beating all the men in the process. Shelley had developed and refined a stroke which was the most optimal style for her, as did Olympic Champion Janet Evans before her and Laure Manadou, David Davies and Lotte Friis (all Olympic Medallists) have done since. Meeting Shelley and seeing her in action was mind-blowing and I was seeing more and more that the consensus in swimming was wrong and

as important as what you actually say. I have met a wide range of swimmers over the years: some are very direct and want straight-forward answers with no ‘fluff’, some crave a detailed scientific explanation, some seek minimal guidance but want assistance with motivation and others respond best to a reassuring approach without any technical jargon at all. Swim Types helps you tune into these traits and tailor your communication accordingly. Knowing what to say, when to say it and how to put the message across is the key to successful coaching and this is the area I am most excited about with the Swim Types system. What you see today is a highly-developed system with thousands of hours of coaching experiences behind it. We’ve put a lot of effort into making the system easy to understand and memorable using cartoons and some light-hearted humour but don’t be fooled into thinking we’ve thrown it together in a light-hearted way. Quite the opposite, identify your Swim Type and follow your individual stroke correction process and you’ll make the same sort of rapid progress with your swimming that you would if we were coaching you in person here in Perth. --- Page 147 Text --- ADAM: If ‘typing swimmers’ is a new idea to you then you may have some doubts about how a classification system is possible, I had a lot of questions in my mind when Paul first took me through the concept in 2007. Please keep an open mind as you browse through the information of each Swim Type, read the profiles and watch the video clips on our website. I’m absolutely sure you’ll start to recognise swimmers that you know, both in how they swim but also in their personalities. Since we launched the system we’ve spoken to

often used by elite swimmers and triathletes to great effect. It’s a shorter, punchier style that’s won many Olympic Gold Medals in the pool, but in rougher open water its natural emphasis on stroke rhythm makes it completely dominant and is used by a significant majority of elite swimmers in this environment. Until now the Swinger stroke style has been much misunderstood and underappreciated in the swimming world as it is not as aesthetically pleasing as the Smooth style, at least not when viewed above the water. When speaking to Swingers, nearly all are under the impression that they don’t have a very good stroke and that they are succeeding in swimming despite their technique when actually nothing could be further from the truth. If you follow professional cycling there’s an interesting analogy here. Jan Ullrich and Lance Armstrong were famous for racing head to head in the Tour de France with very different pedalling styles. Jan liked to turn over a very big gear, while Lance would spin a smaller gear at a faster speed. Each worked perfectly for each cyclist as it suited their individual biomechanics, style and physiology. The same is true for swimmers and their natural stroke style – you could say the Swinger is Lance Armstrong to the Smooth’s Jan Ullrich. The Swim Types system highlights the strengths and weaknesses of these two ideal styles and shows you which is the best for you to pursue, depending on your individual build and the environment in which you are going to swim. Identifying Your Swim Type --- Page 148 Text --- We are sure you are dying to discover your own Swim Type!

the principal of specificity in training (see Chapter 24) and the resultant de-training can see many of these swimmers becoming slower in their races. If you have neglected your swimming fitness then you stand to make some large gains in speed from getting back into some training using Chapter 27 of this book. Overgliders and Open Water As we discuss in Key 3: Open Water Adaptation, open water swimming is distinctly different to pool swimming as waves and chop constantly buffet you. Even in an otherwise flat lake or river, the wake from other swimmers is enough to disturb your progress and interrupt your stroke rhythm. If you swim in open water with a slow stroke rate and an overglide you will be slowed down and stalled in the gap between strokes by disturbed water. Swimmers with a faster more continuous stroke (e.g. Swingers) cut through open water much more efficiently as the delay between strokes is much smaller or in some cases non-existent. This stroke style is very efficient in open water. As a result of pausing with the lead hand, Overgliders have a tendency to ‘catch-up’ and bring both hands together in front of the head. --- Page 168 Text --- PAUL: From working with Overgliders I know that many are frustrated with their performances in the open water. This may be partially offset by the added buoyancy and so improved body position offered by a wetsuit but for the effort you are putting in (both intellectual and physical) you deserve to swim much more effectively in this environment. Overglider Key Stroke Flaws The Overglider’s dominant stroke flaw is a large dead spot in their stroke timing caused by the introduction of a long glide into their stroke. Working on their catch technique and developing their stroke rhythm

swimmers like her defy the conventional swimming logic that you must always swim with a long stroke in order to be efficient. Here lies the Swinger: fast and efficient but unappreciated and unloved — until now! See Laure swim here: www.swimsmooth.com/manadou Swingers are nearly always experienced swimmers with many years of swimming behind them, often from a young age. Classic Swingers have a shorter stroke than many other swimmers but make up for it with a fast stroke rate; this distinctive ‘punchy’ style is very natural to them, they find it very hard and quite alien to swim in any other way. The good news is that it’s not necessary to change that style at all, by refining it and working to their natural strengths of great rhythm and momentum they can become exceptionally fast swimmers both in the pool and in open water. --- Page 172 Text --- The fast stroke rate used by a Swinger means that they roll their body to a slightly lesser extent than the Smooth Swim Type. This means that their arms come a little more around the sides rather than over the top of the body, in doing so they use a straighter arm recovery. This swinging recovery style of a classic Swinger is where they get their name. ADAM: Swingers tend to look quite choppy and unrefined from above the water, which has given them a bad press in swimming circles over the years. Since the invention of underwater video technology we now get to see the beautiful part of their stroke: under the water. Here a refined Swinger’s stroke mechanics are poetry in motion: a great catch and perfect rhythm and timing all working together in perfect harmony! In terms of speed, Swingers cover a very large range depending on the

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
Swingers, Smooths have a longer stroke with a slower stroke rate. Whilst they don’t pause and glide in their stroke like an Overglider, this lower stroke rate is still a disadvantage in open water and can cause them to be stalled slightly as they are buffeted by chop and wake from other swimmers. It can come as quite a nasty shock that some of those Swingers — who you can gap with a devastating turn of pace in the pool — are suddenly right with you in open water or even pulling ahead. Fortunately there is a solution to this problem, with a few modifications to your stroke we can make you much more efficient in open water and leave you fresh to unleash that sprint finish at the end of the race. Experimenting with a straighter arm recovery is important for Smooths in open water as their classical high elbow and low trailing hands can clash with waves and chop as they travel over the water. Getting into the catch a little sooner in the stroke will lift the stroke rate and help drive you through that disturbed water much more effectively. We’re not going to turn you into a high-revving Swinger — that simply wouldn’t suit you — but we do need to shorten your stroke slightly and turn it over a touch quicker. If you’re a triathlete you’ll understand the analogy of using a smaller gear, you’re moving the same speed with a slightly higher cadence but each stroke is slightly easier in itself. As a Smooth you are going to have a nice symmetrical stroke which will help you track straight in open water but developing your drafting, sighting and navigation skills is also going to be critical to take on the open water specialists who

open water swimming and are very excited about the growing number of open water events and challenges available for swimmers around the world. Even if you don’t view yourself as being a super-competitive person and are more interested in achievements and self-fulfilment than competitive placings, you still stand to gain a lot from learning how to train your fitness levels according to the race distance and type of event you have ahead. Balancing your stroke technique development with the right fitness work is essential. Training consistently in the pool is one of the keys to improving your swimming. The training methods we will recommend in this section will put a new lease of life into the idea of fitness training for distance swimmers and triathletes, and will help you discard some myths about what this type of training entails. We will show you how to --- Page 182 Text --- integrate the stroke technique development work covered earlier (Key 1) and ensure that the work that you put into your fitness sessions pays dividends for your chosen event and general swimming proficiency. PAUL: You might be reading this and thinking ‘I don’t ever plan to do a competitive swimming event’ and that’s absolutely fine. However, you will still gain greater enjoyment and variety from your swimming by implementing some of what we are about to suggest. Equally though, I’d personally love to see you sign up for your first event and take a brave step forward towards your first pool or open water competition.

or open water competition. Completing such an event is hugely satisfying and from my own experience I know that having a goal to work towards can be very motivating indeed. Getting out of bed at ‘stupid-o’clock’ to swim before work is much easier when you have something to focus on! My boyhood dream was always to swim the English Channel. As a child I was a competitive pool swimmer and this just seemed to be the event that all British pool swimmers would eventually gravitate towards. In 2006 I was surprised to see that my ‘comedy hero’ David Walliams from the British comedy show ‘Little Britain’ would be attempting the Channel. The level of interest in swimming within the UK that David’s successful crossing raised has been nothing short of amazing, so much so that I often hear from people with no swimming background at all who have set swimming the Channel as their personal goal. Whilst tackling the Channel is still no mean feat, David’s crossing has helped show people that they really can get out there and do it. For the sport of swimming this is just fantastic and in September 2011 not only did I get to achieve my lifelong dream of swimming the Channel, I also got to meet and swim with David Walliams on the second day of his epic eight-day swim down the River Thames for Sport Relief.

Perth, Western Australia: the 19.7 km Rottnest Channel Swim is the world’s biggest mass participation channel swim with over 3,000 participants. A fantastic event and well worth the long flight to Australia! Balancing Your Training for Best Performance When it comes to swim training, many swimmers and triathletes fall into one of two camps: those that train hard every session with little regard for their stroke efficiency and those who have been led to believe that swimming is entirely about technique work and that hard workouts should be avoided as they will ingrain bad stroke habits. --- Page 183 Text --- However, too much focus on either pure technique work or hard fitness sessions without consideration for the other side of the equation is a recipe for underperforming. Focusing on one area to the detriment of the other is the single biggest reason why swimmers and triathletes hit plateaus in their performance. If you know how to balance out training and technique work within a weekly or monthly structure you will make the greatest improvements possible over time. Even then, you still need to take additional steps to adapt your pool stroke to the open water environment if this is where you will be racing, we will discuss this in detail later in Key 3. A plateau in your performance will occur when you have exhausted all avenues for improvement within that given area. If you only ever focus on one aspect of your swimming development, then chances are you are going to reach that plateau very quickly.

Paul all greased up and ready to tackle the English Channel, September 2011 As you will have noticed by now, the combination of these three elements of training, technique and open water adaptation form the ‘Three Keys’ to successful swimming covered in this book. Swim Specific Fitness If you are a triathlete, or are swimming alongside training in another sport, it is very important to appreciate that fitness is specific to the sport you are training in. In sports science this is a well proven fact [1, 2] and is known as the ‘specificity principle’. Training in other sports — particularly those that involve different muscle groups such as cycling and running — will have very little benefit for your swimming. This is because an important part of your aerobic system is in the vein and capillary networks to specific muscles and in the cellular development within the muscles themselves. In other words, you need to train your swimming muscle groups in a way specific to the swimming. Far and away the best way to do this is by swim fitness training! Emmy prepares to tackle a tough threshold session in the pool but it’s all smiles here! --- Page 184 Text --- If you are new to swimming and have a high level of fitness in another sport then we are sure that you would have quickly and independently proven the specificity principle to be true!

of each component which are loosely aimed at each of the six Swim Types. Use them to construct your own training sessions and so perfectly balance your technique, fitness and open water skills work. You can follow any of the sets for any other Swim Type, they will all be useful for your swimming. PAUL: Given the variety of the five types of main sets listed (including six open water skills sessions and six pure technique sets), our Swim Smooth boffins have calculated that by mixing and matching the sets you can create up to 5,100 unique training sessions to follow. Wow — that’ll keep you going for a while! How Will the Different Types of Set Improve My Swimming? We can break down the different types of main set as follows: 1. Speed or sprint work. 2. Endurance training or continuous swimming. 3. Threshold or ‘Sustainable Speed’ sessions. Let’s take a look at each of these training methods in that order. It’s actually the order in which many Masters swimmers and triathletes prioritise their sessions, focusing a lot of training time on speed sessions, some time on endurance sets and relatively little time on sustained speed sessions. In Chapter 26 we will look at a different way to combine these sessions for best training effect as a distance swimmer has a very different set of priorities. By combining sessions in a different way you will soon be making some big strides forward in your swimming fitness. Session Type 1: Pure Speed or Sprint Work --- Page 187 Text --- For those of you who train with one of the many Masters swimming groups around the world, a large component of the training mix will be sprint work. This involves efforts at near maximum pace over short distances of 10

Pure Speed or Sprint Work --- Page 187 Text --- For those of you who train with one of the many Masters swimming groups around the world, a large component of the training mix will be sprint work. This involves efforts at near maximum pace over short distances of 10 m to 200 m with large amounts of recovery between each interval. For many swimmers, this type of training is believed to be the best way of getting faster because they are swimming at very high speed. Certainly if you will be racing over sprint distances (25 m to 200 m) such sets should form a good portion of your training time as they are specific to your event. However, if your focus is on distances over 400 m in the pool, or on triathlon and open water swimming, too much training at this intensity can actually limit your endurance ability as we will see later on in this chapter. Sprint sessions offer the swimmer significant rest periods between each interval to allow higher intensities to be held when swimming. The ratio of work to rest might be anywhere from 3:1 to 1:1 (or more). An example sprint set is: Sprint training is essential if you plan to race in events of less than 200 m. If not then your valuable training time might be best spent with sub-maximal threshold sessions and aerobic endurance work. 8 × 50 m aiming for 40 seconds per interval with 20 to 30 seconds rest between each 50 m In Appendix C you will find six specific sprint sessions that you can incorporate into your programme if you are seeking to improve your outright speed for shorter events below 400 m.

rest between each 50 m In Appendix C you will find six specific sprint sessions that you can incorporate into your programme if you are seeking to improve your outright speed for shorter events below 400 m. If you are competing over longer distances and swimming five or more times per week, then you also probably have some scope to add this type of training to your weekly programme so long as it does not replace more essential threshold-based training. Session Type 2: Endurance Sessions In its simplest form an endurance session might be a long continuous swim at a steady pace, designed to build up your ability to swim for a prolonged period of time without stopping. It is very common to see swimmers who have only a very limited time in which to train (e.g. lunch breaks) jump into the water and simply swim continuously for the entire time they have available. This type of training has its merits, however if every --- Page 188 Text --- session that you complete is swum continuously like this you could be missing out on developing your stroke technique and also run the risk of stagnating from swimming everything at the same steady pace. The mental challenge of longer swims can be significant as you are stuck in your personal ‘bubble’ with very little outside interaction. Here James has used the acronym JKS (Just Keep Swimming!) to keep him motivated during the 20 km Rottnest Channel Swim. This phrase went on to become a mantra of our marathon swimming squad! For those swimmers and triathletes attempting longer distance events (e.g. open water events longer than 2.5 km and triathletes training for a full Ironman), long continuous swims are a nice way of building your confidence that you can cover your target

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
mistake yourself, if you do you will soon blow-up and slow down — swimming most of the set at a slower pace than you otherwise could maintain if you had set off at the right pace. If this happens you have greatly harmed the training effect of the session and you will not develop your aerobic system to anywhere like the same extent as with a well-paced set. Arnies (from our Swim Type system, see Chapter 18) are particularly prone to doing this. I know from my own experience during my early days as a junior triathlete that the mention of the words ‘race pace’ or ‘time trial’ induces a sense of wild panic. If you try to remain calm in these situations and pace out such a swim perfectly, you might swim a PB straight away. Swimmers with very poor pacing always report that their swimming feels easy and smooth in the first couple of hundred meters but then their stroke quickly ‘falls apart’. They might blame a lack of fitness, endurance or the inability to hold good form, and whilst this might partly be the case, nine times out of ten it is simply a pacing issue. Repetitively training like this is not effective at all and will certainly impede your long- term development. In fact inaccurate pace judgement is one of the main reasons swimmers and triathletes fail to reach their potential in the water. ADAM: A coach we work closely with in Montréal, Canada (Charles Gaston-Couturier) describes the challenge of a good training set using something he calls the ‘Sweet Uncertainty Principle’ based on work done by Brunelle in 1988 [1].

describes the challenge of a good training set using something he calls the ‘Sweet Uncertainty Principle’ based on work done by Brunelle in 1988 [1]. A good training set challenges you just enough so that you are a little unsure of whether you can complete the set hitting your goal times. If the set is clearly too easy you would lack stimulation and if the set is clearly too hard to complete this would be very negative and off-putting. Somewhere in between is the sweet spot of the perfect training set: you are uncertain of whether you can meet the goal times and motivated by the challenge of doing so. Accurate identification of your own threshold (CSS) pace is very important and tuning into the feeling of this pace at the start, middle and end of a training session will allow you to better gauge your efforts. This important skill is what we call ‘innate pace judgement’ and developing yours will pay dividends during races when everyone around you starts too fast and then fades badly. When performing a threshold set, the focus should be on swimming longer intervals at a challenging but sustainable pace with much shorter recovery periods between each interval rather than pure speed work. Many swimmers end up in a grey area between --- Page 190 Text --- these two types of sessions, not swimming quite fast enough for it to be a speed set but taking too much rest between each interval for it to be a true threshold set. Swimmers in Perth prepare for their favourite ‘Fresh and Fruity’ threshold session with Coach Fiona Ford leading the way. The ratio of work to rest should be 4:1 to 15:1 or shorter, e.g. 8 × 200 m aiming for 3′15″ with 15 to 20 seconds

be a true threshold set. Swimmers in Perth prepare for their favourite ‘Fresh and Fruity’ threshold session with Coach Fiona Ford leading the way. The ratio of work to rest should be 4:1 to 15:1 or shorter, e.g. 8 × 200 m aiming for 3′15″ with 15 to 20 seconds rest between each 200 m. With such short recoveries it is essential to pace yourself through the set to be assured of completing the session whilst hitting the target times. When you conduct training around this intensity you will be able to maintain much better form and technique than if you go off too fast and end up fighting the water. Many swimmers avoid training at higher intensities for fear of ingraining bad stroke habits but your stroke will only deteriorate if you pace things poorly and blow-up. At threshold pace it is perfectly possible to sustain great technique and you should not be avoiding this ‘sustained speed’ training, it is absolutely essential for your improvement. In Appendix C you will find six specific threshold sessions that you can target for the main set of your harder training sessions. To perform these properly you will need to know your threshold or CSS pace; we will show you how to test for this in Chapter 27. Reference 1.

Your Swimming Month Most triathletes are swimming between two and four sessions per week. As a Masters swimmer or as a pure recreational swimmer, you might have time in your weekly routine to swim more frequently. In any case, developing a good skeleton structure that you can adhere to on a weekly and monthly basis will ensure that you are maximising your time in the pool for your available training time. Ideally, to see true improvements in your swimming you should aim to swim three or more times per week. We often see in our Swim Smooth Perth squads that those who go from swimming two times per week to three times per week really make some good gains in their swimming, often within just six to eight weeks of making this change to their programme. Frequency will always trump volume, for example three 30-minute sessions per week will be more beneficial than one 90-minute session. Of course, you can only train in the time you have available and as long as you are realistic about what can be achieved if you only swim once or twice per week, then you will take away some of the frustration of expecting large gains for relatively little input. Equally though, increasing your frequency from swimming six times per week to seven times per week might not result in any significant increase in performance at all and may risk lethargy, over-training and demotivation. There is nothing more important than turning up at training motivated about the session ahead and if you swim too often you risk losing this ‘mojo’. If you’re swimming five times per week or more and find that you are constantly dreading your swimming sessions and have no motivation for them, try dropping back by one session per week and

motivated about the session ahead and if you swim too often you risk losing this ‘mojo’. If you’re swimming five times per week or more and find that you are constantly dreading your swimming sessions and have no motivation for them, try dropping back by one session per week and see if you can regain your spark. Elite swimmers and triathletes are particularly susceptible to over-training, and making a marginal cut in training volume has been the key for many of them in making some big steps forward in their performance. Paul and Martin plan the next phase of training for the Perth Swim Smooth squad. --- Page 192 Text --- More is not always better — effective training is about striking the right balance given everything you are trying to juggle in your training, work, family and social lives. PAUL: As a triathlete, coach and graduate of sports science, over the years I have invested a significant amount of my research and personal training time into devising the ideal training programme that has exactly the right training hours and precise training intensities. Ultimately this was a fruitless exercise as I found time and time again that what works for one athlete is simply not effective for another and that life events quickly ruin the prescribed training progression, often within just a few weeks of starting the programme. Instead, a much more pragmatic approach works best where you outline a basic skeleton structure which you work from loosely day to day, week to week and month to month. The structure gives you the right mix of sessions between technique development, steady endurance training, threshold sets and pure speed work which you can repeat over and over to give you the consistency you need.

day, week to week and month to month. The structure gives you the right mix of sessions between technique development, steady endurance training, threshold sets and pure speed work which you can repeat over and over to give you the consistency you need. The pace of the sessions themselves is adjusted based on your performances as you go along, adapting to your current fitness levels to keep pushing you forwards. Using such a skeleton structure when training is a very elegant and pragmatic approach and I highly recommend you use one yourself. In a moment we will look at some suggested structures for you to follow, depending on your ability level and the training time available. In terms of scheduling additional recovery time into your plan I recommend you very much listen to your body here, especially if you are only training two or three times per week. In this situation it is unlikely that you are training enough to warrant additional recovery and so if you feel good, carry on training as normal. If you feel a little flat after a hard block of training then take an easy session or some additional rest. My best results have always come from programmes that were simple, fun and motivating and that were laid out in such a way that I could consistently follow them week to week rather than the super whizz-bang scientifically prepared periodised programmes I’ve also tried to follow. Of course you have to have purpose and meaning behind what you do but if you are unable to adhere to a really sophisticated programme then you’re not going to get the most out of it.

At the end of the day life throws curve-balls at all of us when we least expect it and if you can’t be flexible in your programme for risk of throwing that period of training out of the window entirely, then you’re going to find yourself getting very frustrated very quickly. Interestingly enough, this skeleton-structure approach was inspired by my own long-term coach and former British Triathlon Head Coach, Chris Jones. With all the great triathletes on the British World Class Triathlon Programme, we would all aim to keep things as simple and consistent as possible in our training routine. The training structure of elite athletes is nowhere near as technical as you might believe. Recommended Skeleton Structures Table 26.3 shows our recommended training structures, which are to be followed based upon how many times per week you are swimming. As you can see, we include a mix --- OCR from Page 192 Image 1 --- 2 ae = eS ee ik. --- Page 193 Text --- of all three of the training keys — technique, training and open water skills. You can follow these structures year round, performing your open water skills work in the pool when open water is too cold in the winter. As we will discuss in Key 3: Open Water Adaptation, developing and maintaining your open water skills is absolutely critical to swimming at your best in open water.

ADAM: In Table 26.4 you can see Paul’s skeleton structure for his English Channel training in the six months building up to his crossing in 2011.

If you have a sprint background in the pool, or alternatively if you come from a team sport background such as rugby or football, you will probably have a natural disposition towards sprinting. Instead of sprinting powerfully over a short distance, a good distance swimmer has a very different physiology as they need to maintain a slower pace for a long time. However, the different energy systems are highly trainable and with the right training you will gradually transition towards the distance swimmer you need to be for open water races and triathlon. At Swim Smooth we often use the analogy that sprinters are petrol (gasoline) engines and distance swimmers are diesel engines. The further your target event is the less fast- twitch speed matters and the sustained output of a diesel engine becomes more important. We are not talking about swimming at an easy pace here but a strong and sustained pace as you might in a bike time trial or distance running event.

The shirt shows the breakdown of a swimming diesel engine! --- OCR from Page 195 Image 1 --- set ene GEN GINEL --- Page 196 Text --- For the rest of this section of the book we are going to look at something called CSS swimming. This is a form of training that focuses on developing you as a distance swimmer, turning you from that petrol engine into a swimmer who can sustain their speed over long durations. By following this form of training you may lose some of your ability to sprint but your sustained speed will be much higher. Figure 27.17 shows a hypothetical example of this transition from petrol to diesel engine. FIGURE 27.17 The speed profiles of two very different swimmers. The sprinter wins over very short distances, the distance swimmer over longer distances. To put some real numbers on this, take a look at Table 27.5 showing Paul’s race speed at different distances before and during his English Channel preparation. Before training for the Channel Paul’s training contained a mix of sprint work and CSS sets, during the training he switched almost exclusively to CSS training and endurance training. We can see that although he became slower over 50 m, 100 m, and 200 m, by 400 m he is swimming at the same pace and at longer distances significantly quicker. When you have to swim the equivalent of 100 × 400 m to get across from Dover to France, sprint ability is not something you need too much of! Table 27.5 Paul Newsome’s race pace over different

These paces correspond closely to something called your Lactate Threshold (or just threshold for short). This is the point at which lactate starts to gather in your blood stream, which happens when you start to become anaerobic. If you go faster than this pace you are on borrowed time and soon feel ‘the burn’ in your muscles which will force you to slow back down again. CSS is this point in your swimming, go faster than it and you will have to slow down, but swim at CSS and you will be able to swim for 800 m, 1500 m or even 3000 m if you are very well trained.

to slow back down again. CSS is this point in your swimming, go faster than it and you will have to slow down, but swim at CSS and you will be able to swim for 800 m, 1500 m or even 3000 m if you are very well trained. PAUL: I studied Sports and Exercise Science at the University of Bath and was also fortunate enough to be selected as an athlete for the British Triathlon World Class Performance Programme. On this elite programme we were regularly tested in the laboratory to examine our exact level of fitness and to give us precise training levels at which to train. This approach was highly scientific and I loved being part of it. Knowing how you should train and seeing the improvements as a result of this testing was very motivating indeed. However, whilst very useful, such testing simply isn’t available to most age-group athletes around the world. The test procedures are lengthy, involve using a lot of expensive laboratory equipment and by taking lots of blood samples to monitor blood lactate they are quite invasive too. Fortunately there is an alternative way of assessing your swimming fitness that has all of the advantages of laboratory testing but with none of those downsides. The system is called Critical Swim Speed or CSS for short — here at Swim Smooth we are big fans of CSS training! Threshold is an extremely important point in all endurance sports because it is fundamental to your physiology — if you can improve your fitness so that your threshold (and so CSS) is at a faster speed then you will race quicker in any distance event — even in ultra-distance events such as Ironman and marathon swimming. Other fitness factors such as your outright strength or your

the others. Remember that a well-paced effort will feel quite steady at first but build in perceived intensity as it goes on: steady — tempo — hard — very hard. Carefully check that your results make sense, for instance you should have held a faster pace over 200 m than you did over 400 m, is that the case? SPORTS SCIENCE REFERENCES: The method for determining CSS by using a simple non-invasive test, without expensive equipment, was put forward by Wakayoshi [1,2]. This test was simplified in 1993 by Ginn [3] to using just two test swims of 400 m and 50 m at maximum pace to evaluate a swimmer’s aerobic capacity and identify the anaerobic and aerobic components of their fitness. It has been further refined by MacLaren and Coulson [4] who demonstrated that the best distances to choose for a CSS test set are 400 m and 200 m. These are the time trial distances that we now use within Swim Smooth. To determine what your CSS pace is in time per 100 m from your results the easiest way is to use the simple calculator at: www.swimsmooth.com/css. Or, if you would like to run the calculation yourself you can calculate your CSS pace as: CSS (m / sec) = (400 − 200) / (T400 − T200) Where T400 and T200 are your 400 m and 200 m times in seconds. Then convert your speed from m / sec into time per 100 m: CSS (sec / 100m) = 100 / CSS (m / sec) Your resultant CSS pace might at first glance appear a little easy for those of you with experience of interval training but remember that CSS is about a hard 1500 m pace. Certainly you could swim quicker than CSS in an intervals session

= 100 / CSS (m / sec) Your resultant CSS pace might at first glance appear a little easy for those of you with experience of interval training but remember that CSS is about a hard 1500 m pace. Certainly you could swim quicker than CSS in an intervals session with lots of recovery but CSS sets should be performed with short recoveries so that the training effects are focused on the energy systems used in distance swimming, not sprinting. Re-test your CSS pace approximately every four weeks to make sure that you are setting your training intensities properly and thus getting the best out of your training time. The ultimate goal is for your CSS pace to increase, if it does you are pretty much guaranteed to be swimming quicker in your races. This is even the case if you are racing in ultra-distance events that take place well below lactate threshold pace, this is --- Page 200 Text --- because the same energy systems are used at these slower paces too and from their enlarged capacity for work you will be able to sustain a faster pace for longer. Improving Your CSS The key to improving CSS is to perform sets with short recoveries with a strong focus on pacing them correctly. When you swim at your CSS pace the feeling is one of being ‘uncomfortably comfortable’ — it is hard work but you can sustain your technique and speed throughout a training set. It is very important that you do not start these sets too fast and then blow-up! Here are four example CSS sets: 1. 20 × 100 m with 15 s recovery between each. 2. 10 × 200 m with 20 s recovery between each. 3. 5 × 400 m with 30 s recovery between

that you do not start these sets too fast and then blow-up! Here are four example CSS sets: 1. 20 × 100 m with 15 s recovery between each. 2. 10 × 200 m with 20 s recovery between each. 3. 5 × 400 m with 30 s recovery between each. 4. 3 × 600 m with 45 s recovery between each. These total around 2000 m which is about right for fast swimmers with a CSS of around 1:10 to 1:25 / 100 m. As you will see in the training sessions in Appendix C, the length of the sessions become shorter for slower swimmers so do not be put off if these distances appear more than you would normally do in an entire session! PAUL: During a CSS set, I often ask our swimmers what the pace feels like to them on a scale of 1 to 10 (where 10 is impossibly hard) — we are looking for scores of 6 to 6½ in the first few hundred meters before rapidly building up to 7½ to 8 out of 10 for the majority of the set before peaking at 9+ by the end. Obviously the numbers themselves are quite subjective but the important point here is that you will begin to correlate how CSS pace feels as the set goes on. This will help you develop your innate pace judgement which is a critical skill for distance swimmers. Pacing out your races correctly through the start, middle and end phases will give you a huge advantage over your competition on race day. Or you can get a little more creative and really test your pacing abilities with something like our ‘Goldilocks Set’ swum straight through: 4 × 100 m with 15 s recovery. 1 × 200 m with

end phases will give you a huge advantage over your competition on race day. Or you can get a little more creative and really test your pacing abilities with something like our ‘Goldilocks Set’ swum straight through: 4 × 100 m with 15 s recovery. 1 × 200 m with 30 s recovery (Baby Bear!). 4 × 100 m with 15 s recovery. 1 × 300 m with 30 s recovery (Mama Bear!). 4 × 100 m with 15 s recovery. 1 × 400 m and finish (Papa Bear!). In practice, CSS pace feels significantly steadier than a truly hard interval session but is maintainable for a much longer period of time if paced correctly. In the example of the Goldilocks set above it is easy to get carried away on the 100 m intervals thinking the pace is too easy but then find it impossible to hold the same times as you progress through the 200 m, 300 m and 400 m intervals. Aim to keep everything the same pace even if it feels too easy at first — this will really help you develop your pacing skills. --- Page 201 Text --- CSS VS. RACE PACE As a rough gauge, you can calculate your race pace over various distances relative to your CSS pace : 400 m: CSS pace - 2—4 sec per 100 m. 1500 m / 1900 m: CSS pace. 3.8 km / 5 km: CSS pace + 2—4 sec per 100 m. 10 km: CSS pace + 6—10 sec per 100 m. 20 km: CSS pace + 10—20 sec per 100 m (factoring in feed stops of 20—30 sec every 25 minutes or so). English Channel (38 km): CSS pace + 20—30 sec per 100 m (factoring in feed stops of 20—30 sec every 25

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
pace + 6—10 sec per 100 m. 20 km: CSS pace + 10—20 sec per 100 m (factoring in feed stops of 20—30 sec every 25 minutes or so). English Channel (38 km): CSS pace + 20—30 sec per 100 m (factoring in feed stops of 20—30 sec every 25 minutes or so). Of course you also need to train your endurance sufficiently to maintain these paces over the longer swims! Don’t I Need to Swim Faster than My CSS Pace to Improve it? You will have noticed that CSS training sets are swum at current CSS pace in order to become faster. For many swimmers this seems counter-intuitive, going against the commonly held belief that the key to becoming faster is to ‘train at a much faster pace and my body will get used to it’. Unfortunately this logic is flawed because the body does not work like that. When you train significantly faster than threshold you end up splitting the training effect into your anaerobic system too — which you don’t need to develop as a distance swimmer. You also give your body a much greater recovery task after the session, which means it has less energy left over to make the fitness adaptations you are looking for. The end result is that training significantly above CSS pace gives you less development of your threshold speed. Coaches Martin and Gabby explain the importance of correct pacing prior to a CSS set. --- Page 202 Text --- The research by MacLaren and Coulson [4] backs this up, demonstrating that threshold-paced training significantly develops CSS but much harder paced anaerobic sprint training often results in a slowing of CSS pace. Still not convinced? Compare this form of training to weight training. Say you wanted to increase your maximum bench press.

Still not convinced? Compare this form of training to weight training. Say you wanted to increase your maximum bench press. You can currently lift 50 kg and want to get to 60 kg. You can’t go and lift 60 kg — you’re not strong enough. But by doing sets at 45—50 kg your body adapts and improves. To stress a body system and prompt an adaptation you just need to approach your current limit or threshold. Many Masters swim sessions do focus on short, sharp speed sets as their swimmers will be competing in pool-based sprint events. If you are a triathlete or longer distance pool or open water swimmer, you need to be wary of doing too many high intensity intervals at the expense of more steady-state CSS work. Unfortunately, many view these longer, harder sets as dull or even antisocial but when faced with limited training time you need to be assured that the work that you are doing is paying the biggest dividends. Once you get into the swing of CSS work you will find it challenging and be motivated as a result, especially when you see your performances improve. Gathering a few friends together to swim these sets always makes things more enjoyable and is highly recommended. So, No More Sprint Training? You can certainly still include some anaerobic work and short sprints in your training — they’re good for your swimming technique in themselves: they give you a ‘feel for the water’ at higher speeds and they train your nervous system to recognise the higher forces associated with producing greater power output.

Sprint races can also be a lot of fun between friends and should not be discounted because they are not specific to distance swimming. What we are suggesting is that you shift your key training sets away from anaerobic sprint sessions to CSS work if you are focusing on events over 400 m. In practice this means slowing the pace a touch and shortening the recoveries — making the speed more sustained. Pacing Your CSS Sets Correctly Think of your CSS pace as a single reference point from which all your other training paces are calculated. In the training sets in Appendix C we use this principle, giving you a target pace for different sets in reference to your CSS pace. For example a simple endurance set for a swimmer with a CSS of 1:40 / 100 m is: 1000 m at CSS pace + 10s per 100 m, i.e. 1:50 / 100 m 800 m at CSS pace + 8s per 100 m, i.e. 1:48 / 100 m 600 m at CSS pace + 6s per 100 m, i.e. 1:46 / 100 m 400 m at CSS pace + 4s per 100 m, i.e. 1:44 / 100 m --- Page 203 Text --- 200 m at CSS pace + 2s per 100 m, i.e. 1:42 / 100 m PAUL: Using one of these devices in this manner is quite an experience, it is like swimming against the red World Record line that follows swimmers up and down the pool at the Olympics.

--- 200 m at CSS pace + 2s per 100 m, i.e. 1:42 / 100 m PAUL: Using one of these devices in this manner is quite an experience, it is like swimming against the red World Record line that follows swimmers up and down the pool at the Olympics. It has a nagging habit of catching you up if you set off too fast! You will have noticed by now that these paces are very specific and would make pacing them using a watch or pool clock quite difficult. The solution to that problem is to use a Wetronome or Tempo Trainer Pro, which are beepers that you place under your swimming cap. In lap-interval mode they can be set to beep at the exact pace that you want to be holding, for instance 1:40 / 100 m pace is 25 seconds per 25 m. So by setting the device to beep to you every 25 seconds you can pace your swim to be at the end of the 25 m lap (or half lap in a 50 m pool) when it beeps. This gives you an amazing control over your swim pacing and greatly simplifies the process, allowing you to switch off and concentrate on your swimming and holding good form — these beepers make the perfect virtual training partner for your CSS sessions. Confusing CSS Test Results From time to time you might get some unexpected results from the CSS calculation, especially if you are comparing results from different swimmers. The most common of these is where one swimmer has faster 200 m and 400 m time trial results than another but ends up with a slower CSS — which at first sight seems very strange. To understand this result we must remember that CSS pace is

from different swimmers. The most common of these is where one swimmer has faster 200 m and 400 m time trial results than another but ends up with a slower CSS — which at first sight seems very strange. To understand this result we must remember that CSS pace is slower than both 200 m and 400 m pace and is much closer to 1500 m pace, take a look at Figure 27.18 to see the speed relationship for two such swimmers. Our faster swimmer is much quicker at 200 m but only slightly faster at 400 m, this drop off in pace between the two indicates the swimmer is faster at these speeds by virtue of a very strong anaerobic capacity, not because they have a higher CSS. In fact when we extrapolate the results out we see that this swimmer actually has a slower CSS and would be slower at 1500 m and beyond. FIGURE 27.18 Middle distance and distance swimmers compared. The middle distance swimmer’s 200 m and 400 m speeds are quicker but they have a slower CSS pace as the drop off between the 200 m and 400 m speeds is much steeper so this trend will continue. See our CSS calculator at www.swimsmooth.com/css. --- Page 204 Text --- The Wetronome and Finis Tempo Trainer Pro - one of these beepers will make the perfect virtual training partner for you! One problem to be aware of is if you have erroneously timed the two time trials and included a 400 m time that is a faster pace than the 200 m time — a clearly impossible result.

absolutely essential. Besides the necessity to train at a pace appropriate to your race distance, the biggest skill you will develop is the ability to control and manage your effort over time. In the heat of a squad session, pacing can go straight out of the window as swimmers try frantically to keep up with the person in front of them. In our Perth Swim Smooth squad sessions, the leader of each lane is instructed to use a beeper under their swim cap set at the right target pace for the lane, all the other swimmers in the lane have to do is set off five seconds behind the swimmer in front and maintain that gap. This takes the pressure out of these types of sessions and encourages the lane to work together as a team, each happy to take their turn at the front with the beeper. Whilst it sounds simple to maintain a given swimming pace, in practice all sorts of things can affect how well you develop this skill, not least your competitive urge and the notion that a training session should feel hard from the very first lap for you to maximise the benefit from it. Instead of this, think of a CSS session as part training, part technique — the technique being your ability to pace things out well. The two go hand in hand: by sticking to your goal pace accurately you will maximise the training effect of your session. ADAM: Did you know that over 90% of all endurance world records for running (track) and swimming (pool) have been achieved through perfectly even pacing or with a ‘negative split’ — i.e. finishing faster than you started?

that over 90% of all endurance world records for running (track) and swimming (pool) have been achieved through perfectly even pacing or with a ‘negative split’ — i.e. finishing faster than you started? Pace judgement is an absolutely essential skill for great distance swimming and with CSS training you will really start to develop yours. Watches such as the Finis SwimSense, the Garmin 310XT (and the newer 910XT) and the Swimovate Pro can help you monitor your pacing consistency. You will need a GPS device such as the Garmin to monitor pace in open water. In the future we expect this technology to keep evolving becoming ever more accurate and cheaper too. --- Page 206 Text --- Developing Pace Awareness in the Open Water In the pool you can easily monitor your swimming pace and your strokes per length to assess your consistency but in open water neither of these variables is easily measured. Elite open water swimmers do monitor one metric though to ensure some consistency and that is stroke rate — how many strokes they take per minute. Normally this information is fed to the swimmer from a coach on a support boat and in general the target is to avoid stroke rate dropping by more than 10% over the course of a race. Every swimmer has their own unique stroke rate that they can sustain. As an extreme example of how consistent an elite swimmer can be, Shelley Taylor-Smith (seven-time World Marathon Swimming Champion) held 88 SPM (strokes per minute) for a distance of 70 km from Sydney to Wollongong (Australia) only varying by ±5% over this epic 12-hour challenge. Amazing! Probably the biggest single difference between an amateur and a professional endurance athlete is their ability to feel exactly what level of perceived exertion they are

(strokes per minute) for a distance of 70 km from Sydney to Wollongong (Australia) only varying by ±5% over this epic 12-hour challenge. Amazing! Probably the biggest single difference between an amateur and a professional endurance athlete is their ability to feel exactly what level of perceived exertion they are holding for a set distance. Every single session they do, elite swimmers are tuning themselves into what it feels like to hold a certain pace over a specific distance. ADAM: Grant Hackett is reputed to have been able to hold multiple 100 m intervals in the pool all within 0.4 seconds of each other without using a pace clock — an amazing feat when you consider that most amateur swimmers will vary by 2 to 12 seconds over a similar set with the assistance of a pace clock! With good training preparation you too can tap into this deeper understanding of what perceived exertion and pace you can truly maintain over a given distance. You won’t always get this right but when you do get it wrong you should try to learn as much as possible so that you can improve your pacing ability in the future. It is very difficult to accurately judge what pace you can hold for an open water event given all the external factors that are out of your control such as waves, chop and currents. Sometimes giving yourself a very strict target pace can be psychologically detrimental, especially if you are dropping off this pace for reasons out of your control. By getting to know your body better and knowing exactly what level of fitness you have in the pool at any point in time, you can improve your ability to judge the right pace whatever the external influences.

pace for reasons out of your control. By getting to know your body better and knowing exactly what level of fitness you have in the pool at any point in time, you can improve your ability to judge the right pace whatever the external influences. The key to good pacing is the pace you set in the first 20% of your race when you are fresh, this will ultimately determine how successful you are in that event. The more refined and developed your innate pace judgement, the more accurate you will be at pacing this first section of the race. PAUL: In my training for my English Channel swim in September 2011 I used a Garmin 310XT GPS device under my swim cap in all my open water sessions so that I could assess my ability to hold a straight line in the open water and to see how far and fast I’d actually swum. Whilst I couldn’t see this data as I was swimming, I did use the Garmin to beep at me every 500 m which kept me focused on just the next seven minutes of swimming rather than thinking about the very long training session as a whole. When the Garmin was downloaded, I could clearly see how well I’d been pacing myself and whether or not I needed to make any changes to my pacing for future sessions. It was a brilliant tool to use and one which I can highly recommend! --- Page 207 Text --- Tracking data recorded by the Garmin 310XT and 910XT software is extremely useful for assessing your performances in open water.

One of the most frequently asked questions at the end of our full-day Swim Smooth Clinics is ‘do you recommend gym training for swimmers and triathletes?’ Our answer is that it depends, mostly on whether you have enough time available in your week. In an ideal world we would all be full-time athletes with access to well-equipped gyms and physiotherapy, pilates and even yoga classes.

be full-time athletes with access to well-equipped gyms and physiotherapy, pilates and even yoga classes. In this situation you would definitely benefit from such conditioning work to help you become a more balanced athlete but in reality most of us are time-strapped and the danger of introducing significant conditioning work to your programme is that you would have to cut back on the swimming itself to fit it in. With this in mind we have designed a flexibility and conditioning routine that you can complete quickly and efficiently both before and after swim training or even in front of the TV! What is Dry-Land Training? Dry-land training can be loosely categorised into three main areas: 1. Flexibility and mobility. 2. Core stability and rehabilitation. 3. Strength training. PAUL: Dry-land training derived its name from the fact that many of the world’s elite swim programmes would engage their swimmers in conditioning exercises on the pool deck immediately before and after training in the water. Australian swimming legend Ian Thorpe was famous for arriving at training 30 minutes prior to every session to work on his mobility and flexibility. This extra conditioning work has often been cited as one of the reasons why he was so successful in winning multiple Olympic Gold Medals. Whilst we will probably never reach the same levels of flexibility and conditioning that elite swimmers have, making improvements in important areas can help you make large improvements to your stroke technique. 1. Flexibility and Mobility --- Page 210 Text --- When it comes to swimming, a big limiting factor for many triathletes is a lack of flexibility. Poor flexibility can give rise to many stroke technique flaws including crossovers, dropped elbows and sinking legs, all of which will severely limit your potential in the water. Swim, bike and

develop your stroke using a specific drill and stretch your ankles simultaneously. Outside of the pool you can also use the two stretches shown to assist in stretching off your ankles. Left: Sit on the floor with one leg extended in front and the other bent across the top. Hold the top leg as shown with the hand gently pulling the foot towards you. The stretch is felt through the top of the foot and into the shin. Right: In a kneeling position, place your feet out straight behind you. If you are quite inflexible through the ankles you will feel the stretch through the top of the feet and into the shin. You can lift one knee at a time to develop this stretch further. Avoid this stretch if you have ever had any knee issues. --- Page 214 Text --- Calf and Plantar Fascia Stretch. If you find that you are prone to cramping when wearing flippers then there is a strong likelihood that you are very tight in your calf muscles and in the plantar fascia in the arch of the foot. Include these stretches regularly in your routine to loosen off these areas and reduce your incidence of cramp in the future. Toes curled under stretch (left). Stay in a kneeling position but tuck the toes under the foot and onto the floor. You will feel the stretch through the sole of the feet. Proceed gently with this stretch if you are tight in this region, little and often is best. Calf stretch (right). Crouch down with foot kept flat on the floor and the other pointing back underneath you. Keep your body weight over the foot which is flat on the ground and feel the stretch through the lower calf muscle (soleus). 2. Core Stability

technique sets. 2. Always keep close to the lane rope and swim in the circular direction advised on the plaque at the end of the lane, either clockwise or anticlockwise. If there is no sign, observe what others are already doing in the lane and aim to replicate that — here in Australia the convention is to always swim clockwise but in the UK lanes alternate clockwise and anticlockwise. Stay close to the lane rope and avoid swimming in the middle of the lane as this is when head-on collisions occur or accidental clashing of arms. 3. If someone is catching you up and you are aware that they wish to get past you, either pull tight in towards the lane rope so that they can overtake (but still keep swimming and reduce your speed a fraction) or better still, when you reach the end of the pool pull off to the side, stop and let them past. 4. Be vigilant when you are pushing off in the middle of a set — is someone coming up to the wall where you are to turn? If so, don’t push off immediately in front of them as this is somewhat rude. Let them past and then when it is clear jump into a spot behind them. 5. Aim to start each and every lap with a good torpedo push off, they really pay dividends for your posture and make you look quite the ‘pro’! --- Page 238 Text --- 6.

using fins or pull buoys, chances are that the speed or ‘pecking’ order of the lane may change. If you know that you are particularly quick with fins on, don’t be afraid to ask to go in front of the person in front of you or even lead the whole lane. 7. Aim to pace yourself well, this is ultimately what keeps the lane flowing effectively and what makes the most out of your own practice time. 8. Aim to do your drill and technique work to the best of your ability, do not feel pressured to rush through this aspect of the session. A drill worth doing is a drill worth doing well — always remember that. 9. Try to keep all of your kit neatly organised on the pool deck — a mesh kit bag is highly advisable and prevents other swimmers mistakenly walking off or using your kit. Also, naming your kit in bold black marker is always worth doing! 10. Lastly, be nice to your fellow lane swimmers. It might be early in the morning or late at night and we can all be a little grumpy at these times but there’s never an excuse to get irritable with anyone in your lane. If there’s a problem, let the coach know or just diplomatically address it with your swimming buddy. Tumble Turns Tumble turns can take a bit of practice to master but with a few simple tips, you too can be flipping at the end of each length very effectively.

of each length very effectively. Tumble turns save you time and also maintain the flow and rhythm of your stroke better than a touch turn but they are by no means compulsory in any squad session. Many swimmers worry about the disorientation of being upside down whilst trying to coordinate a roll over in the water or fear bashing their legs on the side of the pool from being too close. Instead aim to swim in positively, achieve a tight tuck and firm foot plant on the wall — confidence is the key to a successful tumble. FIGURE 31.27 A great tumble turn has the above steps. --- Page 239 Text --- 1. Approach the turn with confidence but avoid lifting the head too high or out of the water completely to ‘spot’ the wall (a very common mistake for beginners). 2-3. You should commence your turn between the black ‘T’ on the floor of the pool and the wall, i.e. about 1m (3 ft) away — if you really stretched out with one hand you should just about be able to touch the wall. 3. Tuck your chin into the chest and bring your arms down by your sides. 4-5. Think about getting into the tightest, smallest ball that you can — this will help you flip over faster than if you stay outstretched. Bring your knees into your chest. At this point if you were to open out you’d be perfectly on your back. Start bringing your hands back above your head. 6. Keep the knees, ankles and feet together and aim to plant them firmly on the wall with your toes pointing to either 10 o’clock or 2 o’clock on the wall. Note: you do not have to attempt to add in a full twist at this

recently from one of our swimmers who is contemplating the challenge of the 20 km Rottnest Channel Swim in February 2012: Hi Paul, I have been doing the Saturday morning set the last three weeks with Stu and Clare and feel like I am pretty close to running on empty after about 4 k. You mentioned using carbohydrate gels in one of the sessions last week — would it just be one of those after 3 or 4 km? In terms of fluids — just water or a Gatorade or similar? Would you recommend anything before a 5—7 k swim — bananas, muesli bar?? Where do you get the carbohydrate gels? Cheers, Chris There are a couple of things worth pointing out with respect to training and racing nutrition to fully answer this question Chris: 1. When training early in the morning your body has slept for 6—8 hrs and whilst this requires less energy than when you are awake, you still do burn calories whilst asleep. Although some swimmers prefer training on a totally empty stomach, we highly recommend having something before training to top up your muscle and liver glycogen stores. I personally have ‘Weet-bix’ cereal with hot milk and a sprinkle of sugar washed down with a vitamin drink, which I find works really well. Other people might have a banana, muesli bar or some toast and honey or --- Page 246 Text --- jam. I will often sip on a bottle of water on my way to the pool to top up my hydration levels. Food, food, glorious food! A collection of possible food and carbohydrate drink mixes for your training and racing. 2.

to the pool to top up my hydration levels. Food, food, glorious food! A collection of possible food and carbohydrate drink mixes for your training and racing. 2. Your body typically stores enough fuel in the form of carbohydrate (glycogen) to last you through 1½—2 hrs of moderate to hard intensity training. In general you want to avoid becoming depleted so it’s important that you top-up your energy during any session lasting over an hour. When you exercise very lightly you use a larger portion of stored fat as your fuel source but as soon as intensity starts to lift above 70—75%, an ever greater share of your fuel source starts to come from carbohydrates. Given that this session is long (5+ km) and it becomes progressively faster, it has the potential to be a real drain on your glycogen stores. As you get fitter, the body becomes better equipped for utilising stored fat as a fuel source but your pacing in the first 1—2 km of a hard set like this is important as well — go off too fast and you will immediately start draining your carbohydrate stores which will leave you wanting later in the session or race. 3. Personally I alternate between drinking 250 ml of Gatorade (mixed into the recommended 6—8% solution) every 25 minutes with 250 ml of Gatorade or water together with a carbohydrate gel like a GU. Some say you should never ingest a gel and Gatorade together (or similar carbohydrate rich drink) as the sugar solution might be too strong in your stomach and can cause gastro-intestinal problems. Whilst this is true for some, it’s not true for everyone — which is why you should use your training sessions as a way of experimenting with what works best for you. My

drink) as the sugar solution might be too strong in your stomach and can cause gastro-intestinal problems. Whilst this is true for some, it’s not true for everyone — which is why you should use your training sessions as a way of experimenting with what works best for you. My little formula gives me 500 ml of fluid per hour plus 30 g carbohydrate from the Gatorade and 25 g from the gel (55 g total). This is somewhat lower than the standard recommendation often made to triathletes of 1g / kg / hr (75 g per hour for someone of my size) plus 600-1000ml of fluid per hour. I’ve always found the greater total fluid and fuel volume more of a source of stomach upset than combining a gel together with Gatorade, but as I say this is highly individual and something to test out thoroughly yourself. --- Page 247 Text --- 4. These days carbohydrate sports gels can be bought at many sports stores or online. Whilst I use Gatorade most often as my drink source (because of its wide availability in supermarkets) other brands offer more sophisticated carbohydrate drinks too. ‘Pure Sport’ is a drink that we’re currently trialling (as used by Mr Michael Phelps himself). This contains a little protein as well as carbohydrates and electrolytes — the carbohydrates are for fuel, the electrolytes are to replace lost minerals through sweat, and the protein is to enhance recovery and reduce muscle damage. Other good brands include Powerade, Science In Sport and Powerbar. 5. Not everyone likes to consume a gel due to the texture, so experimenting with things like Powerbars, cereal bars, honey sandwiches and bananas are also a worthwhile thing to do to find out what works best for you, albeit they are generally harder

Powerade, Science In Sport and Powerbar. 5. Not everyone likes to consume a gel due to the texture, so experimenting with things like Powerbars, cereal bars, honey sandwiches and bananas are also a worthwhile thing to do to find out what works best for you, albeit they are generally harder to eat and digest than gels. On my Rottnest crossings (and for the English Channel) I took a large variety of things with me (some of which are comfort foods and make me feel good if I’m getting low, e.g. Fry’s Turkish Delight — yum!) just in case I fancied something different. When I swam the English Channel, despite being in the water for a little over 12 hours, I hardly strayed from my original Gatorade and GU gel plan but it was good to know that I had something different readily available if I wanted it. 6. Whilst it’s fair to say that sweat and evaporation rates are a lot different on land than in the water, you do still lose fluid in the water, so rehydrating is essential. If you are not needing to urinate every 60—90 minutes whilst training, you could be starting to become dehydrated. Equally, over-hydrating (more than 1.2 litres per hour, especially as plain water) can be extremely dangerous due to an effect known as hyponatremia, which is where you flush the body’s cells of their sodium stores. So whilst my 25-minute fuelling and hydrating strategy works for me, you should experiment between 15 and 35 minutes to see what works best. In a pool session when you are not swimming continuously it is advisable to have a water bottle for little sips in between your major fuel stops. 7. If you finish a session completely drained of fuel then it’s going to take

If you finish a session completely drained of fuel then it’s going to take you a much longer time to recover. We get fitter (and faster) through a good balance of hard work and recovery. Take too long recovering between sessions and you will feel much less energetic at your next session. Consequently you always end up performing below par and never see the big improvements. This is why fuelling is so essential for effective training. 8. Aiming to get in 20—30 g of carbohydrates immediately after a long session like this will really pay dividends — a Nutella sandwich is always a favourite for me within 20 minutes of finishing a tough session. Things like Sustagen drinks are also a good way of recovering post session too. This is certainly not an exhaustive section on sports nutrition but the take home points are: don’t skip on nutrition, experiment with what works best for you and don’t forget to consume some carbohydrate rich foods immediately after training to aid rapid recovery and reduce the urge to snack on fatty foods later in the day. --- Page 248 Text --- KEY 3 Open Water Skills, tactics and stroke adaptations for swimming in open water --- Page 249 Text --- CHAPTER 33 The Importance of Open Water Skills When discussing open water events with swimmers, one of the most frequently asked questions we are asked is: ‘What time do you predict I can do for open water swim X?’ As we saw in Chapter 27, knowing your current level of swim specific fitness (your CSS pace)

Water Skills When discussing open water events with swimmers, one of the most frequently asked questions we are asked is: ‘What time do you predict I can do for open water swim X?’ As we saw in Chapter 27, knowing your current level of swim specific fitness (your CSS pace) is a key predictor of your performance for distance swimming in the pool. However, knowing this threshold pace will only give you a guesstimate of what you might be capable of in the open water. Swimming well in the open water requires you to be proficient in a wide variety of areas within swimming including: Managing anxiety and the feelings of claustrophobia that can come from the ‘washing machine’ effect at the start of a race. Sighting and the ability to swim straight between marker buoys. Drafting faster swimmers for improved times or with swimmers of similar ability for less energy expenditure. Turning and improving your speed around buoys with maintenance of good rhythm and momentum. Effective wetsuit swimming by adapting your stroke to work with, not against, the rubber of the suit. Strategies to adapt to a variety of open water conditions, both technically and psychologically. In an effort to constantly refine your technical capabilities in the pool it is very easy to forget about honing your open water skills until the start of the summer race season. However, to swim effectively in open water these skills need to be developed and refined all year round with just as much priority as traditional stroke technique work. This can be done very effectively — whilst having a lot of fun — in the pool during the winter months. As we shall see, developing these skills in the controlled environment of a pool is easier in many regards than in an

much priority as traditional stroke technique work. This can be done very effectively — whilst having a lot of fun — in the pool during the winter months. As we shall see, developing these skills in the controlled environment of a pool is easier in many regards than in an open water environment. Working on improvements in your stroke mechanics is very important and you can certainly make significant gains in this area in the pool. However, studies have shown that an effective drafting technique can save you up to 38% of your energy expenditure [1]. This is a staggering saving and to be honest one that you would struggle to match by improving your stroke mechanics alone, at least in the short term. If you add into that equation further improvements in handling anxiety, sighting, navigation skills and the ability to swim straight without a black line, then you can --- Page 250 Text --- understand why Swim Smooth is so passionate about giving your open water skills the attention they deserve all year round. What’s more, developing these skills can be a lot of fun and help to break the monotony of following the black line endlessly up and down the pool. PAUL: Here in Perth we run an open water skills session once a week all year round. This takes places on a Saturday lunch time and is a favourite session of local triathletes and open water swimmers — even in the middle of winter. We have a lot of fun and it’s personally my favourite session of the week to coach! Age-group triathletes are particularly time poor as they must split their training time between three sports, around a full time job and having a healthy family life too. This shortage of time in the water

A large marquee was erected at the event and athletes were able to mingle and look at all the latest training gear whilst asking questions of the professional triathletes and seeking useful tips. I remember being questioned by one of the local athletes who would be doing his very first triathlon at the event the following day. Like many novices he was very apprehensive about the thought of swimming in the dark and cold Llyn Padarn lake having had very little experience up to this point. As I was about to start offering a few tips of advice to the athlete, his father came over and interrupted us. He was a rather burly and forthright Welshman who had his own thoughts about how his son should approach the event. Knowing the area well, he proceeded to tell us a tale about how several plane and helicopter crashes had occurred at the site with the most recent being an RAF Wessex helicopter crash in 1993. His Dad then thought it humorous to tell us that the bodies were never recovered and to just imagine one floating up to the surface whilst we were swimming! Obviously this threw

crashes had occurred at the site with the most recent being an RAF Wessex helicopter crash in 1993. His Dad then thought it humorous to tell us that the bodies were never recovered and to just imagine one floating up to the surface whilst we were swimming! Obviously this threw the poor young guy completely but that very afternoon I went for a swim in the lake to test several wetsuits and all I could think about was this story to the point of it bringing on quite a severe panic attack. I’ve never swum so fast back to shore in my life! Anxiety attacks in the open water are very common and can affect swimmers of any ability level, the only common denominator sometimes being those who have more vivid imaginations. The possibility of anxiety attacks should be taken seriously as they cannot only ruin your race but your overall confidence in your swimming ability too. If you ever feel anxious in open water — or in the pool — here are some important coping strategies that you can use to help you overcome those feelings: 1. Remember You Are Not Alone. Many of us are embarrassed to even admit that we feel uncomfortable swimming in open water but most swimmers suffer some level of anxiety to a greater or lesser extent. Try talking openly with others about how you feel and this will help you identify what in particular triggers the feelings of panic. Half the battle when tackling anxieties is working out what it is that specifically brings on an attack — for example it could be swallowing some water and fearing you’re going to choke or perhaps losing your orientation and sense of direction. Other common triggers can be the cold itself, fear of the deep,

out of your control. One of our best teaching mantras that also works well in the open water is ‘breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe’ as outlined in Chapter 7. Give it a try — simplicity of focus is key in the open water. 4. Practise With Friends. Any time you go for a swim in the open water you should set up some practice sets with a group of friends. Swimming in a group supports everyone’s safety in the water and with the support of non-threatening, non-competitive training partners you will really start to tune up your skills and grow your confidence. Practise some of the more advanced concepts like drafting and open water turns in the pool first so that you get a good head-start before using them in open water. PAUL: If you only remember one open water tip from this book, let it be to remember to exhale into the water at the start of a race. When the gun goes off far too many swimmers set off at break-neck speed, hold their breath and so become very tense. Holding your breath is a sure-fire way to trigger a panic attack and potentially ruin your whole race. By all means set off at a good pace but remember to breathe out under the water as though you are sighing and you’ll have a fantastic swim! --- Page 254 Text --- CHAPTER 35 Swimming Straighter --- Page 255 Text --- PAUL: We started this section with a very common question: ‘How fast do you think I can swim this event in the open water?’ I was asked this exact question by an athlete that had just started swimming with us in early 2010, prior to the Busselton Half Ironman.

do you think I can swim this event in the open water?’ I was asked this exact question by an athlete that had just started swimming with us in early 2010, prior to the Busselton Half Ironman. Dan is a very dedicated athlete who seeks to improve his times in all three disciplines and often uses the latest technology to help him in this quest. Given that he’d been training consistently for the event in the pool and knowing that his CSS (threshold pace) was exactly 1:48 / 100 m, I thought that this pace would be a reasonable goal to aim for during the 1900 m swim leg. Although a Half Ironman swim is normally just below CSS pace I took into account that Dan is a leg-sinker (and still at that point very much an ‘Arnie’ Swim Type, see Chapter 18) and so would gain considerable assistance from the buoyancy of his wetsuit. I quoted a target of between 34 and 35 minutes for the swim having the exact figure of 34 minutes and 12 seconds in my head. Given that I’m often very close in my predictions, I was confident that this would be a good goal to aim for. Part of Dan’s GPS plot indicating inaccuracies in the ability to swim straight inthe open water. On race day I waited at the swim exit to see all my athletes complete the swim discipline. After 35 minutes Dan hadn’t exited the water; 37 minutes – still no sign; 40 minutes – nothing. By 42 minutes I started to get very concerned that he had suffered a bad cramp or had succumbed to some kind of marine life attack, God forbid.

sign; 40 minutes – nothing. By 42 minutes I started to get very concerned that he had suffered a bad cramp or had succumbed to some kind of marine life attack, God forbid. Ten minutes after his allocated goal time Dan came running out of the water, seemingly very happy with his swim, stating that he felt great. All I could think was how disappointed Dan would be when he saw his time – he had averaged 2:13 / 100 m or 25 seconds per 100m slower than what I thought he would. After the race I discovered that Dan had swum with a waterproof Garmin 310XT GPS device under his swim cap, which had recorded his entire swim path. On analysing the data we found that instead of covering 1.9 km, Dan had actually covered 2.33 km. More than 22% too far! This was an incredibly insightful piece of data only made possible with the advent of waterproof GPS devices like the Garmin. What was also interesting to see was that Dan had indeed averaged 1:48 / 100 m for the 2.33 km that he had covered, exactly as I thought he would. Dan would go on to use his Garmin to improve his ability to swim much straighter in future events and knock off massive chunks of time by addressing this aspect of his swim preparation. Prior to GPS tracking we could only ever guesstimate how much extra distance someone might be swimming off course but now we have the technology to find out. Whilst Dan’s example might sound quite extreme, as we see more and more GPS data at Swim Smooth we find that swimming 10% or more too far in a race is really very common.

Sighting Every swimmer needs to sight forwards in order to stay straight but developing the movement and timing of their sighting technique is something very few people practise regularly. The most common mistake to make when sighting forwards is to lift your whole face out of the water and try to sight and breathe at the same time. In order to lift your head out sufficiently to breathe, the legs have to sink dramatically adding to your drag profile in the water, even when wearing a wetsuit. A good sighting technique involves lifting just your eyes out of the water and then rolling your head to the side to breathe, this should happen in one smooth fluid movement. If you were about to breathe to your right, you would press down slightly with the right arm as you pull through so as to raise just your eyes above the water line before continuing to roll the head with your body’s natural rotation to the right and take a breath as normal. Do not try and hold your head up high for several strokes until you can see exactly where you are going with a waterpolo style of stroke, that is extremely fatiguing. If you do not see where you are going on your first sighting stroke then do not panic, just try again in a couple of strokes time. You will not always get a clear view every time you sight forwards but by sighting two or three times in a row you will gradually change what is initially a fuzzy picture into a clearer view of where you are going. Once you have that image in your head of where you are heading, lock onto it and focus entirely on cutting as straight a line as possible to that

a row you will gradually change what is initially a fuzzy picture into a clearer view of where you are going. Once you have that image in your head of where you are heading, lock onto it and focus entirely on cutting as straight a line as possible to that point. 4. Sighting on Large Immovable Objects This is a classic tip. Before the start of your open water event, walk around as much of the swim course as you can and get down as close to water level as possible to line up the marker buoys with fixed points on the horizon. A large object on the horizon could be significantly easier to see than a turn buoy whilst swimming in a group of swimmers during the race. Suitable objects might include the peak of a hill or mountain, a large building or trees. By correctly lining these points up before the start and then aiming towards them when the gun goes off, you stand a much better chance of swimming in a straight line between the turn buoys. At many locations it might only be possible to line up the first marker buoy from the start line. If that is the case, then work out as many sighting points as you can for other sections of the course. If your swim will be in a river or --- Page 259 Text --- following the line of a shore, make sure that you gauge the distance well in order to swim parallel and straight. Keep a check on this every time you breathe to your side. 5.

to swim parallel and straight. Keep a check on this every time you breathe to your side. 5. Don’t be a Sheep When drafting behind another swimmer it is very easy to fall into a false sense of security and think that the lead swimmer will track accurately towards the next buoy. Even the best swimmers in the world can drift off course sometimes, so maintain your own responsibility for swimming straight by regularly sighting and adjusting your position if necessary. If your lead swimmer does drift off course you will have to weigh up the benefit of the draft versus swimming in a straight line. This is not always an easy decision and you may have to risk the success of your swim on this choice. ADAM: It’s well worth investing in a couple of pairs of goggles (preferably of the same design that you know fit you well) with different lens tints for the different lighting conditions that you may experience. Cool mirrored lenses will be too dark in low-light conditions no matter how good you look wearing them! Equally, a clear lens in low early morning sunlight can be dazzling. Choose goggles which do not leak, have good anti-fog properties and won’t dislodge easily if you happen to get a knock from another swimmer. Avoid touching the inside of the lens with your greasy fingers (especially if you’ve used them to apply sunscreen or wetsuit lubricant) as this will ruin the anti-fog properties very quickly. You won’t notice your goggles if they are working well but a goggle malfunction could cost you your race. --- Page 260 Text --- CHAPTER 36 Drafting Effectively Swimming behind or to the side of another swimmer to gain an advantage from being in their wake is called ‘drafting’.

notice your goggles if they are working well but a goggle malfunction could cost you your race. --- Page 260 Text --- CHAPTER 36 Drafting Effectively Swimming behind or to the side of another swimmer to gain an advantage from being in their wake is called ‘drafting’. As we will see later, studies have shown up to a 38% saving in your energy expenditure from drafting another swimmer – that’s a huge saving and equivalent to what you would gain from being tucked up behind a couple of cyclists in a pack if you ride a bike. The benefits of drafting in open water are so great that it is essential for you to become comfortable drafting other swimmers and fine tune your skills in a variety of different positions and situations. ADAM: If you are new to open water swimming or triathlon then you may be wondering if drafting behind another swimmer is legal. Don’t worry, it most certainly is! Unlike in a cycling time trial or non-drafting triathlon bike leg, drafting behind other competitors is very much seen as part of the sport of open water swimming and something that you should be looking to become accustomed to and maximise to your advantage. --- Page 261 Text --- PAUL: In our squad training sessions over in Perth, I am very keen to know and monitor the performance of our swimmers. The best way of doing this is to use a regular time trial over a distance such as 400 m or 1000 m in the pool. I don’t think anyone looks forward to time trials as there is certainly no hiding from the results but it’s only through measuring your performance that you’ll really know whether or not the hard work you are putting in is paying off.

400 m or 1000 m in the pool. I don’t think anyone looks forward to time trials as there is certainly no hiding from the results but it’s only through measuring your performance that you’ll really know whether or not the hard work you are putting in is paying off. Time trials are also an excellent way to assess your key open water skills like drafting. In October 2010 I decided to run a 1000 m time trial for our squads but with a slight twist. In our 5:30 am Tuesday session we have four lanes of differing abilities: Lane 1 (the ‘fast lane’) has swimmers capable of around 20 minutes for 1000 m. Lane 2 (the ‘faster lane’) is capable of approximately 17-19 minutes for 1000 m. Lane 3 (the ‘even faster lane’) around 15-16 minutes for 1000 m. Lane 4 (the ‘fastest lane’) is capable of sub-15 minutes for 1000 m (most swimming around 13 minutes). Drafting in open water is perfectly legal and when performed correctly is a huge strategic advantage. We performed a 1000 m time trial and the eight swimmers in lane 1 averaged 19 minutes and 12 seconds. This was a very pleasing result and a good sign that their hard work was paying off. Unbeknownst to them though, we would be repeating the same exercise again in just two weeks time but this time drafting one behind the other would be actively encouraged! For this second time trial we invited two of the swimmers from lane 2 to swim at the front of lane 1 with the instruction for them to set the pace at their personal best time from two weeks previous. This equated to 17 minutes and 41 seconds for the 1000 m, a pace which they successfully repeated. The other

swimmers from lane 2 to swim at the front of lane 1 with the instruction for them to set the pace at their personal best time from two weeks previous. This equated to 17 minutes and 41 seconds for the 1000 m, a pace which they successfully repeated. The other swimmers in lane 1 started immediately behind and had the sole goal of trying to stay on the toes of the swimmer in front for the entire 1000 m. Knowing that these lane 2 swimmers were significantly faster, many shuddered at the thought of how hard this task would be but, lo and behold, every single swimmer in lane 1 went on to swim 17 minutes and 41 seconds! An improvement of 91 seconds (or nearly 100 m in distance) from just two weeks previous. Even ‘a healthy sprinkling of Swim Smooth magic’ in the areas of training and technique could not give these swimmers that increase in speed in two weeks – it was down to the benefits of drafting faster swimmers. Despite their excellent performances some of the swimmers said that they didn’t enjoy the experience of swimming so close to others and that it felt claustrophobic. This is a fair observation, especially for those newer to open water swimming. However, in the Swim Smooth offices we receive many emails from swimmers around the world who are frustrated that they are under-performing in open water and want to --- Page 262 Text --- know how to improve. A typical comment we hear is ‘once I get through the start I try to find some clear water and then lengthen out’ but there-in lies the problem: clear water is the last thing you should be seeking in open water if you want to achieve your best performances, you should

typical comment we hear is ‘once I get through the start I try to find some clear water and then lengthen out’ but there-in lies the problem: clear water is the last thing you should be seeking in open water if you want to achieve your best performances, you should be looking to draft all the time and prepare in training to be comfortable doing so. Could this be the source of your own open-water plateau? The potential speed improvements gained by drafting effectively make an interesting comparison to those made by improving your conventional stroke technique or fitness. By drafting effectively you stand to gain between 30 seconds and two minutes per kilometre swum, a very large chunk of time which you cannot stand to ignore. Improvements to your speed from stroke technique gains or swim specific fitness may be less than this amount individually but each should be looked at as an important component of your entire preparation. We’ll show you later in Appendix C how you can combine these elements in your training sessions to give you the maximum performance gains for your swimming. The ability to draft effectively takes skill and a certain tenacity, it doesn’t just happen without practice. If you are planning on competing in triathlon or open water swimming events then you should be practising these skills in a structured manner all year round, just as you would your conventional stroke technique. Very few swimmers and triathletes do this, offering you the potential for a distinct competitive advantage!

for a distinct competitive advantage! Technical Aside If you are interested in the research behind drafting here’s an overview of the key studies: ADAM: The technical term ‘metabolic cost’ refers to the energy used by the swimmers. You can equate it to your physical effort: a reduction of 20% metabolic cost is a 20% reduction in your workload. A collaborative study in 2003 between Jean-Claude Chatard of the University of Saint-Etienne in France and Barry Wilson at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand [1], aimed to show just how much benefit there is to be gained from swimming behind, or to the side of, another swimmer in a fixed flume tank environment. The study examined which were the most effective positions (to the side or behind) and also the optimal distance to be from the lead swimmer. The study concluded that sitting approximately 50cm behind the lead swimmer reduced the draftee’s metabolic response between 11% and 38%. The large range in the result possibly indicates just how skilful this practice is, with those more technically proficient at drafting being able to reap the biggest rewards. Several other studies have also shown similar savings. Delextrat et al. in 2003 [2] found a 10-24% reduction in the metabolic cost of swimming when drafting was compared with swimming solo. In a 1998 study of elite triathletes, Chatard, Chollet and Millet [3] found up to a 3.2% improvement in direct speed (around 40 seconds per 1500 m). Interestingly, this latter study indicated that those of very lean muscle mass saw the --- Page 263 Text --- biggest gains from drafting, potentially because the elevated speed assisted in their horizontal body position in the water – Arnies take note! How to Draft There are two distinct positions in which you can draft: 1.

the swimmer you overtook happily swimming on your toes! If you are really in a group of swimmers that are too slow for you then you will need to break free and swim solo but a better strategy might have been to start slightly quicker to find a better group to swim with. Your innate pace judgement∗ is important here as it will help you judge your own pace and those of others around you at the start of a race, allowing you to look for swimmers slightly faster than yourself to latch onto in the first 50 m or 100 m. Of course if you know your competition well then you can simply line up directly behind a swimmer slightly faster than yourself before the race starts and stick to them like a limpet when the gun goes off! This tactic has personally served me well in many races and seen me significantly outperform where I would otherwise finish in a race. ∗Pace judgement is a very important skill in swimming and one that you can fine tune by using your training sessions in the pool.

a turn buoy in a triathlon or open water swim can be very intimidating to those new to open water swimming. Many worry about getting caught up on the fixing rope or being pushed --- Page 268 Text --- under water by their competitors (a very rare occurrence). These fears are mostly groundless but there is little wonder many swimmers give turn buoys a very wide birth adding considerable distance to their swims. You might also feel the need to switch to head-up breaststroke round the buoy in an effort not to get swamped. This will ruin the rhythm and flow of your swim though and can result in other competitors swimming into the back of you. By working on improving your turning technique you can swim through these areas of the course in a much more effective (and impressive!) manner: 1. Get Ahead. If you have been swimming side by side with a couple of other swimmers, it will serve you well to make sure that you are the first around the buoy. Put in a short burst of speed about 25 m before the turn to get there first. 2. Corkscrew Roll. As you approach the buoy, keep in close and aim to slide the hand closest past the buoy and roll over onto your back and then continuing the roll immediately back onto your front. Add in a little twist as you do so and this should give you a neat 90° turn without breaking your stroke rhythm. If you wish to turn left, it’s your left hand that should slide past the buoy to start the process and for a right turn, your right hand should slide past. For very tight turns try combining two consecutive rolls to bring you around the buoy quickly and efficiently.

rhythm. If you wish to turn left, it’s your left hand that should slide past the buoy to start the process and for a right turn, your right hand should slide past. For very tight turns try combining two consecutive rolls to bring you around the buoy quickly and efficiently. This skill does take some time to master but it is a lot of fun and practice makes perfect! 3. Know Your Bearings. Once you are around the buoy focus immediately on locating the next marker buoy, do not dilly-dally here! Quickly seek out the mark and get a clear bearing on it, making use of any landmarks in the background to assist you. Keep the surge going at this point and you might just drop the guys who went into the turn with you. PAUL: Larger marker buoys at the bigger events will float very high on the water such that they create a body width’s gap under the buoy as the design tapers underneath. Avoid getting so close that you find yourself in this gap as it can be very difficult to escape without the room to bring your arm over the surface of the water! --- Page 269 Text --- CHAPTER 38 Better Wetsuit Swimming Most swimmers have a good appreciation of the potential performance gains of swimming in a wetsuit, mostly from the increase in buoyancy offered by the suit. A low-lying body position in the water is the biggest factor holding back many lean male triathletes so it is little wonder they experience the biggest improvements of all swimmers from wearing a buoyant wetsuit.

triathletes so it is little wonder they experience the biggest improvements of all swimmers from wearing a buoyant wetsuit. ADAM: We conduct a lot of wetsuit testing with different styles of suits and different types of swimmers in Perth. In a well fitting suit, we often see time savings of up to five minutes over 1500 m in swimmers who have very ‘sinky’ legs. Amazing! As we shall see though, some other swimmers don’t enjoy swimming in their wetsuits at all. --- Page 270 Text --- PAUL: I have been working with double Ironman winner Kate Bevilaqua for the last 12 months over in Perth. Kate is a fantastic athlete but is someone who finds swimming in a wetsuit very awkward indeed. It is true to say that most swimmers are substantially faster in a wetsuit than without, however Kate finds the exact opposite: she feels it is slowing her down. Many triathletes are held back by a very poor body position but conversely some have very good natural buoyancy and find that the addition of a neoprene suit actually lifts them too high out of the water. This is the problem that Kate was experiencing. Kate was giving away the best part of ten minutes to the other professional women in the Ironman swim when using a wetsuit. At this level of competition this is a massive amount of time and a real Achilles heel in her racing. Between Ironman Western Australia (December 2010) and Ironman Lanzarote (May 2011) we lowered Kate’s swim time from 61 minutes to 53 minutes. How did we do this? Technically Kate swims very well in the open water without a wetsuit but as soon as she put on her suit she felt like she was going backwards. We took a close look at

was a great confidence booster to them when they got in the water on race day. I’m very pleased to report that of the 34 squad members who raced from our team, not a single person pulled out of the event and of the 1000+ entrants we claimed three top-10 finishes overall and eight individual age- group gold medals. A very successful day for Swim Smooth! IMPORTANT! Remember, when practicing in open water always ensure that you are swimming with a buddy and that someone on the shore knows where you are. Also ensure that there is adequate safety support at your swimming venue in the event of a problem. In conditions where there are swells, tides, currents and cold water, if you are in any doubt about your ability to cope, DO NOT attempt to swim. The following tips are designed to provide food for thought and to encourage you to experiment in a range of open water swimming environments with subtle (or sometimes substantial) adjustments to your stroke technique. --- Page 276 Text --- 1. Flowing Rivers Salt water in the sea or ocean is significantly more buoyant than fresh water in lakes and rivers, something you will notice immediately when swimming without a wetsuit in these environments. Most swimmers welcome any increase in buoyancy as it helps improve their body position in the water. When swimming in fresh water you may wish to adapt your stroke for the reduced buoyancy by tilting your head subtly down to lift your backside and legs higher. When swimming in a flowing river and where access will permit, aim to swim close to the bank when you are swimming against the current and in the middle of the river when the flow is pushing you along. The greatest flow is normally

lift your backside and legs higher. When swimming in a flowing river and where access will permit, aim to swim close to the bank when you are swimming against the current and in the middle of the river when the flow is pushing you along. The greatest flow is normally in the middle of a river with a reduced flow nearer the banks; make the most of this effect by adjusting your position depending on your direction of swimming and you can save a lot of time on your swim. 2. Lakes The threat from marine wildlife in lakes is very low but they can be quite eerie to swim in if they have dark and murky water. In most locations around the world lakes are quite cold too. Both of these factors can exacerbate feelings of anxiety or panic when swimming. Getting into cold water is often more of a mental than a physical challenge. When entering a lake do so slowly and pause when thigh deep to splash some cold water over your face two or three times. The receptors that set off the gasp-panic response to cold water are all centred around your eyes and cheek bones and splashing water here will allow your body to adjust before you start swimming. Also try splashing water on your chest and back if you are not wearing a wetsuit or pull out the neck of your wetsuit to allow some water to run down your chest. This might feel --- Page 277 Text --- uncomfortable but you will be calmer and less likely to panic when you first start swimming. The hardest part about any cold open water swim is just getting started – after preparing properly, turn your brain off and get on with it. A quiet brain’s

--- Page 277 Text --- uncomfortable but you will be calmer and less likely to panic when you first start swimming. The hardest part about any cold open water swim is just getting started – after preparing properly, turn your brain off and get on with it. A quiet brain’s a good brain in this respect! WARNING: When swimming in water temperatures of less than 15½° C (60° F) with (and especially without) a wetsuit there is increased risk of becoming hypothermic. Significant care and attention should be exercised whenever considering a cold open water swim. The International Triathlon Union rules state that whilst wetsuits are forbidden in temperatures greater than 22° C (72° F), they are mandatory below 16° C (61° F) for all age-group competitors. All triathlon swim legs are now cancelled in temperatures less than 13° C (55° F) irrespective of distance. FINA also regulates the World Cup 10 km open water swimming events to between 16° C (61° F) and 31° C (88° F). Some of the world’s more notable ultra-marathon events (e.g. the 34 km Lac Magog swim in Canada) have seen temperatures down at 11° C or 12° C (52° F to 54° F) in the past but swimming for this duration in these temperatures without a wetsuit takes significant training and adaptation, often including substantial fat gain for insulation. DO NOT underestimate how potentially dangerous swimming in very cold water can be. 3. Sea and Ocean Whilst the wake and waves generated by other swimmers can turn any flat water into a turbulent mess, it is in the sea and ocean that you’re likely to face the most challenging conditions and where you will need to adapt your stroke technique the most. When entering rough water from the shore, it’s essential to go

other swimmers can turn any flat water into a turbulent mess, it is in the sea and ocean that you’re likely to face the most challenging conditions and where you will need to adapt your stroke technique the most. When entering rough water from the shore, it’s essential to go under (not through or over) breaking waves. Ensure that you know what is underneath you and if it is safe to do so, dive under the waves with both arms extended to protect your head. If the water is shallow and the bottom sandy, grab onto some sand to prevent you being pushed back by the wave and once it has past, drive off the bottom towards the surface and start swimming. You may need to repeat this a few times until you are past all the breaking waves. A straighter arm recovery and higher stroke rate will serve you very well as you make your way through the swell and chop. There are no prizes here for a pretty stroke and this is one of the reasons why many of the world’s best open water swimmers and triathletes have seemingly scrappy strokes in the pool but excel in rougher water where momentum and rhythm is key. We call swimmers with this style of stroke ‘Swingers’, as explained in Chapter 22. Dead spots, overgliding and slow stroke rates significantly inhibit open water swimming in challenging conditions. It’s no wonder that many of the world’s top open water swimmers have stroke rates in excess of 85 strokes per minute (SPM) and can hold this rate for hours on end. They might not have the longest strokes in the world but in open water, the rhythm, momentum and a certain degree of punch are perfectly suited to the environment. You might not

everyone else is going to struggle in these conditions but that you can lift your stroke rate and punch through the waves and chop then you are going to really excel in your races. Most of all, learn to love the experience: it’s akin to the challenges of a hilly cycle ride or technical MTB trail versus a ‘boring’ flat time trial! --- Page 279 Text --- PAUL: A question we often get asked is ‘Where should I position myself at the start of a race?’ Many new swimmers have been told to hang back and stay out wide to avoid the hustle and bustle of the start. Whilst we would never encourage anyone with limited experience to head right to the centre of the mêlée, it’s often a mistake to go too far back and wide as well. The last thing you want to do is add a large amount of extra distance by taking a long path to the first buoy or get caught behind many slower swimmers by starting right at the back. Even if it’s your first ever open water event, you should have spent enough time practicing the skills outlined earlier in Open Water Adaptation (Key 3) to become familiar with swimming at close quarters with other swimmers. Far too often we hear from swimmers whose very first experience of swimming in open water was during a race. This is a recipe for disaster as you seriously risk a panic attack and being put off this great sport for life. If you have worked on your specific open water skills both in the pool and in open water training, there’s no reason why you cannot start amongst other swimmers of your speed and take the shortest line to the first buoy. Who knows you might

this great sport for life. If you have worked on your specific open water skills both in the pool and in open water training, there’s no reason why you cannot start amongst other swimmers of your speed and take the shortest line to the first buoy. Who knows you might just surprise yourself by finding an excellent draft and having a great swim even if you do get a little jostled occasionally. Through proper preparation you’ll know what to expect, how to tackle it and take advantage of the conditions. Above all else, have fun out there!

Each drill is referred to and discussed in the main text of this book. The purpose and focus of each drill is described clearly. Take the time to read the descriptions carefully and refer back to reflect on the tips once you have tried the drill. Whenever you perform a drill you should always be aware of the purpose of doing it and the key focus points of the drill; never swim drills for the sake of them without a clear purpose in mind. Drills are a very powerful way to

assistance from the legs. Push off from the wall and start performing strokes, returning the recovering arm forwards underwater. This underwater recovery might feel odd at first. Don’t worry too much about your return path, simply slip the hand forwards fingertips first as easily as you can. Emphasise ‘reaching over the barrel’, bending your elbow right at the front of the stroke and exaggerating the movement as much as possible. Keep the lead hand constantly in motion, either extending forwards, tipping over and catching the water or pulling it backwards. Don’t pause at any stage! The drill’s mantra is ‘reach and roll!’. Repeat this to yourself to help develop the rolling action. Pull through to your hip on every stroke, emphasising your body roll as you do so. Drill Tips You can perform the drill either with your head up above the water or down beneath watching your arm strokes. There’s a tendency to tense up when performing Doggy Paddle, try and relax and breathe! Visualise an imaginary rope about 50 cm or 1½ ft underneath you. As you pull- through you are aiming to pull down this rope. If you tend to pull very wide in your stroke or pull-through with a straight arm the rope-visualisation will be very powerful. Think of this as if you are normally pulling down two seperate ropes, one for your left arm and one for your right. Merge these ropes together into one single line. Once you have a good feel for the drill, experiment with adding a touch more rhythm and tempo to the movements. If you’re too gentle with it you will struggle --- Page 303 Text --- to feel the water properly so lift the tempo a touch to develop the rhythm and timing of a good catch. When Doggy

--- hey --- Page 313 Text --- You can experiment with your stroke whilst wearing a band to see the effect it has on your body position. Try: Pushing down on the water during the catch with a straight arm. Pushing the water forwards as if overgliding and putting on the brakes. Flexing your ankles to 90° so that your toes point towards the bottom of the pool. You’ll soon experience how much your legs sink if you have any of these flaws in your stroke! Purchasing Bands You can purchase bands from swimming retailers or make one by cutting up a car or bike inner tube. The band should hold your ankles lightly together. --- Page 314 Text --- APPENDIX B Swim Type Stroke Correction Processes This appendix contains a step-by-step process that each Swim Type can follow in order to correct their stroke, making extensive use of the drills in Appendix A. If you have not yet identified your Swim Type then first do so in one of the following ways: By reading the profiles in Chapters 18–23. Using the Swim Type Questionnaire at: www.swimtypes.com/yourtype. Using the observation sheet at: www.swimtypes.com/observation. Arnie Stroke Correction Process If you are an Arnie, use the process in the order outlined below to develop your swimming, referring to the relevant parts of this book. This process is tailored directly to your specific needs so keep focused on it and don’t become distracted by other areas of stroke development which are not relevant or a priority for you right now. The Arnie: plenty of power, needs more control! --- Page 315 Text --- PAUL: As an Arnie you may feel impatient to become a strong swimmer but ironically that may be one of the things holding you back. You need to slow things

this position. Whilst performing Doggy Paddle emphasise bending the elbow early in front of your head and keep your lead hand constantly in motion – either extending forwards, catching the water or pressing it backwards but never pausing! Keeping the arms and hands constantly in motion might feel very alien to you at first but this is a critical element to move across into your full stroke. --- Page 324 Text --- Move from dropping the wrist and showing the palm forwards (left) towards tipping the fingertips down and keeping the elbow higher than the wrist (right). PAUL: An interesting experiment to try as an Overglider is the Scull #1 drill but purposefully done incorrectly with the elbows and wrists dropped and the palm of the hand facing forwards. This position is designed to replicate the position that your hand and forearm might be in when trying to overglide. As you attempt to do Scull #1 incorrectly you’ll notice that you either stay stationary or you start to actually move backwards in the water! You’ll also probably notice your legs sinking at this point, even if using a pull buoy to keep your legs buoyant. Pay attention to how much water pressure you feel on the palm of your hand as you scull incorrectly in this position – it’s likely to be a lot more than when you do it correctly and are moving forwards. This is one of the key reasons why it’s easy to be fooled into the idea that your overglide is preceded by a good catch as you feel significant water pressure on the palm of your hand; the only trouble with this is that the water pressure is actually slowing you down significantly and effectively pushing you backwards! Now transition into doing the drill correctly

the Author 220 v --- Page 7 Text --- This page intentionally left blank --- Page 8 Text --- Foreword The world of swimming has been very good to me. Growing up in Winter Haven, Florida, I was able to go from the kid who got cut from other sports to Olympic champion. As a television commentator for swimming, I get to continue my pas- sion for the sport that I love. I have known Coach Scott Bay for many years, and we’ve had many great talks about swimming: its history, its evolution, and, most important, the recent advances in technique. We have worked together at several clinics, and we always have a great exchange of ideas and observations. Coach Bay is truly a student of the sport. In Swimming: Steps to Success, Coach Bay explains the elements of technique that are part of good swimming. There will always be variations by elite swimmers, and I encourage you to explore some of your own. This book can serve as a jumping-off point where you can get sound advice on stroke technique and instruction. So . . . whether you picked up this book out of curiosity or sought it out because you want to see what swimming has to offer, you will enjoy Coach Bay’s detailed instruction and continue your journey into the amazing world of fun, fitness, and competition in swimming. Best wishes to you on your journey!

friendly observer to duplicate them yourself. 3. Study the common errors that coaches look for so that you can avoid them! 4. When reading about and executing the drills, keep in mind that they are often designed as “overcorrections” for a specific technique flaw. Drills are intended to help you create a new pattern of movement. After completing each drill, remember to score your success. 5. At the end of each step, review the key points in the Success Summary to make sure that you understand the material. Then total your scores from the drills in that step and make sure that you’ve achieved the needed level of success before moving on to the next step. As you make your way through the steps, you will begin to appreciate that swim- ming is not so much about brute strength as it is about the timing and rhythm of your movements. Getting it right takes a lot of thoughtful practice, and you will benefit from revisiting the steps when you have trouble with a particular skill or technique. ix --- Page 11 Text --- Climbing the Steps to Swimming Success Swimming is a journey, and this book is designed to help you work through that journey one step at a time. Each step is laid out with a focus on a certain skills or techniques and ways to increase or decrease the difficulty. If you have trouble with a particular skill or step, remember that swimming consists of complex sets of move- ments that are not part of any other athletic activity. Be patient with yourself; the key is your progress. As with any journey, no matter how long or short, this one begins with the first step. x --- Page 12 Text --- The Sport of Swimming This book is

gulp of air and then hold their breath for as long as they can while swimming. This approach typically leads to a bad experience, such as hyperventilating or even concluding that swimming is just too hard and giving up altogether. Each of these defining characteristics of swimming is discussed in greater detail in the following chapters, which constitute a progression of steps to lead you to success! Swimming venueS: PoolS Swimming pools come in many sizes and shapes, and various configurations can provide a great place to learn and train. Only certified pools are used in recognized competitions, and they come in a variety of strictly measured distances. In the United States, many age-group and college competitions take place in what are called short- course yard (SCY) pools, which measure 25 yards (~23 m) in length. The United States is the only country still competing in this type of pool, and other countries typ- ically use short-course meter (SCM) pools, which measure 25 meters (~27 yd) (figure 1). Because meters are about 10 percent longer than yards, record times for meters swims are longer than those done for yard swims. Note that in this book, yards are used for pool dimensions. If you swim in a pool measured in meters, you can use the same number given in the descriptions. For example, if an instruction is to swim 25 yards, that can also be 25 meters. Another type of competitive swimming venue is a long-course meter (LCM) pool, which is often referred to as an Olympic-size pool. LCM pools are 50 meters (~55 yd) long, and though they may not look particularly long on Olympic television broadcasts, the experience of swimming in them can be much different than that of swimming in a short-course pool. All of these competition pools

often referred to as an Olympic-size pool. LCM pools are 50 meters (~55 yd) long, and though they may not look particularly long on Olympic television broadcasts, the experience of swimming in them can be much different than that of swimming in a short-course pool. All of these competition pools share certain standard features, such as starting blocks and—even more important, as discussed in step 4 of this book—a set of back- stroke flags. These flags, or pennants, are strung across the pool’s lanes 5 yards or xii --- Page 14 Text --- The Sport of Swimming False start Backstoke rope flags 5 m 15 m 5 m 25 m E6544/BAY/FIG 01.01/534229/KH/R1 meters from the edge of the pool to signal to backstroke swimmers that they are approaching a wall—a crucial safety feature. Competition pools are also outfitted with starting blocks, or platforms. In addition, during competitions, a thin sensor is attached to the pool wall to record the time of each swimmer’s first touch rather than relying on handheld timers. Pool rACeS The majority of swimming meets and races take place in pools (rather than in open-water environments), and venues around the world host events featuring var- ious strokes and distances on courses like those just described. Each national swim- ming federation has its own minor rule variations, but the basic structure of a swim race is always the same. All competitors start at the same time and adhere to the rules of the prescribed stroke, and the finish order is ranked from fastest to slowest. In events with more participants than lanes, the competition is conducted in mul- tiple rounds or “heats.” Either heats are used to seed swimmers for the final, or heats are pregrouped to put swimmers of similar speed in the same heat, and the

order is ranked from fastest to slowest. In events with more participants than lanes, the competition is conducted in mul- tiple rounds or “heats.” Either heats are used to seed swimmers for the final, or heats are pregrouped to put swimmers of similar speed in the same heat, and the best time from any heat wins the race. These can be used to determine seeding for finals or so that similar-speed swimmers all swim together, and the heats are timed with the fastest swimmer being declared the winner. It has become easier to compare times from different heats thanks to the development of sophisticated timing equipment, standardized and certified pool lengths, and touch pads that automatically stop a clock when a swimmer makes contact. xiii smroftalp gnitratS m 31.2 m 92.81 Figure 1 A 25-meter pool. --- Page 15 Text --- The Sport of Swimming geTTing STArTed: APPArel In order to learn the sport of swimming and train effectively for competition, you need certain kinds of gear. For starters, choosing the right suit can be an important part of both your appreciation of swimming and your comfort in the water. Many types of modern swimsuit are available in different fabrics and cuts. Something that you might wear to the beach is not necessarily the best choice for a swimming workout, since beachwear is designed more for fashion than for function. Swimsuits, on the other hand, have evolved to maximize fit and functionality. Swimsuits Unlike ancient swimmers, modern contestants are of course required to wear some sort of swimsuit. Suit design has changed dramatically over the years, and today males typically opt for a brief or “jammer,” which runs from waist to just above the knee. These formfitting suits are typically made of a material that stretches, such as nylon, spandex,

below the bony part where the eyebrows are located, in the softer part of each socket. Without using the strap, press the goggles gently onto this soft tissue and see if they stay even for just a few seconds; if they do, you have a good fit! The strap merely needs to hold the goggles in place, and of course it should not be made so tight as to injure your eyes. The strap should fit above your ears and wrap near the top of the back of your head (not at the base of your skull down near your neck). Beyond these basics, goggle preference is an individual matter, much like the choice of putter for a golfer. Considerations include one’s face shape and head size, as well as one’s preference for a foam, silicone, or rubber gasket (or no gasket at all). The gasket is simply the part of the goggle that contacts the face around the eye or the barrier between plastic and your face. Choosing among these options is largely a matter of what works best for you. Most sporting goods stores and swimming pro shops carry a variety of goggles, and you can simply ask an associate for a demo model or for permission to open a package in order to check the fit. Caps A swimmer with long hair often wears a cap for two reasons. First, of course, it keeps the hair out of the way and reduces drag; second, it provides a measure of protection from xiv --- Page 16 Text --- The Sport of Swimming the sometimes-harsh chemicals or other environmental factors in the water. These environmental factors can include the sun when outside, bacteria in the water, and other chemicals in the water—such as a residual-like suntan lotion that came

or backstroke, thus isolating and training the pulling motion of the swimming arm stroke. Figure 5 Pull bouys. Size and shape will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Snorkel The swimmer’s snorkel is a fairly recent development (figure 6). Of course, traditional side-mounted snorkels have been around for years, but the newer center-mounted snorkel is designed specifically for swim training. It allows swimmers to focus fully on their strokes without the added concern of when and where to breathe. xvii --- Page 19 Text --- The Sport of Swimming Figure 6 Swimmers’ snorkels are typically center mounted rather than offset like they are for scuba diving, and they have a strap that goes around the head. geTTing STArTed: drillS And Their PurPoSe Because body movements are controlled by the brain, the activity of swimming—an unnatural activity for humans that requires complex, timed movements—requires us to program the brain in order to direct the body effectively in the water. This process is sometimes referred to as developing “muscle memory,” but it actually involves brain imprinting and patterning. With this in mind, several drills are described for each step in this book in order to imprint the relevant movement patterns on your brain so that you can easily replicate them over and over again. One caveat: Some of the drills imprint an overcorrection that will later be refined. As mentioned earlier, swimmers often use training equipment to help them acquire new skills or imprint new movement patterns. One must also take care, how- ever, not to become dependent on that equipment for being able to move through the water with skill and ease. In addition, your success depends on doing the drills and using the equipment correctly rather than quickly. As with any learning, some swim- mers progress faster than others, and each

ever, not to become dependent on that equipment for being able to move through the water with skill and ease. In addition, your success depends on doing the drills and using the equipment correctly rather than quickly. As with any learning, some swim- mers progress faster than others, and each skill presents new a challenge. Therefore, prepare yourself to be patient—swimming is a learned process that takes some time. Swimming is one of the best sports in which to participate from a very young age to a very old age. Some competitions even offer a 95-and-over age group! Athletes can participate in this sport for such a long time—and at such advanced ages—because of its low- to no-impact nature and the fact that it enables one to focus on technique and effective movement. Science tells us that at a certain point in life we stop getting stronger and gaining endurance; however, even though you may not be able to get faster after a certain point, swimming always gives you a chance to get better. Let’s move on now to the steps to swimming success, which enable you to learn and practice skills that provide a solid foundation for lifelong enjoyment! xviii --- Page 20 Text --- Step 1 Floating The goal of this first step is to move from a vertical position to the horizontal neutral position that serves as the platform for swimming in all four competitive strokes. This step also helps you become comfortable in the water. By the end of this step, you should be able to • transition from vertical to floating on your back, • transition from vertical to floating on your front, • balance on your center of buoyancy in a streamlined position on your back, and • balance on your center of buoyancy

### Swimming STEPS TO SUCCESS_full_text.txt
the end of this step, you should be able to • transition from vertical to floating on your back, • transition from vertical to floating on your front, • balance on your center of buoyancy in a streamlined position on your back, and • balance on your center of buoyancy in a streamlined position on your front. The Physics oF Buoyancy and FloaTing Floating is a skill, which means that anyone can do it if he or she learns how. As humans, we float naturally, at least to some degree, because our lungs are filled with air. In fact, our center of buoyancy is located approximately in the center of the chest, at the sternum. Some other sports also require attention to one’s center of gravity, but the priority in swimming, of course, is to find that center while moving through the water. You can imagine this center as the center of a teeter-totter or seesaw on a chil- dren’s playground. When everything is in balance, the teeter-totter does not move. Lift either end, however, and the opposite end goes down. With this analogy in mind, you can start learning how to float on your back. FloaTing on your Back This section takes you from standing in a vertical position to simply floating on your back. You need access to a pool with water deep enough to reach at least to your waist but shallow enough that you can still stand in it. If needed, the action can also be done from the side of a deep pool with a few modifications. Back Floating With Arms Extended The objective here is to lie back on the water with your arms and legs spread out for balance, almost like a starfish, and float without movement (figure 1.1). Before you 1 ---

people arch the back to push the torso up. Push the upper part of the back down and rotate the pelvis up to bring the feet up to the surface of the water. It may be helpful to visualize bringing the belly button closer to the spine. drills For PracTicing Back FloaTing Just as basketball players don’t shoot one free throw and assume they have mastered the skill, swimmers practice their techniques over and over—even the basic ones—to keep their skills sharp. Once you feel comfortable that you are able to perform this skill floating on the back, it is time to practice it without assistance from the bottom of the pool. To practice going from vertical to horizontal, use the following series of drills. They can be performed in deep water if you are comfortable in that environ- ment and possess at least a beginning level of swimming skill. Otherwise, do them in water no deeper than neck level. Back-Floating Drill 1 Push-off on your Back In this drill, you are positioned at the side of the pool, facing the wall, with both hands on the gutter or deck. Your feet should be on the wall and your knees and toes point- ing up toward the surface of the water. Lean your head back (looking up), release your hands from the side of the pool, gently push off with your feet, and assume a relaxed floating position. For many swimmers, this drill requires more than one try. Here is the sequence once again: lean head back, release hands, and gently push off with feet. You have succeeded when you can do the drill repeatedly with your legs together and your arms crossed. The purpose of this drill is to help you get skilled at and comfortable with going from

is relaxed and your head is in line with your spine. For a good mental image, imagine stretching your neck and making it very long. missTeP Your hips sink. correcTion Ensure that your abs are not contracted (as in doing crunches); this part of your body should be relaxed. Make sure that there is no ten- sion in the back of your neck from lifting your head. 9 --- Page 29 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success MissteP Your head and feet are underwater. CorreCtion This problem result comes from curling the back too much. Keep your spine straight and your limbs relaxed and out away from the body for balance. Once you are able to perform this skill successfully for at least a few seconds, it is time to move on to more advanced floating skills. Front Floating in a T Position The next part of this progression takes away some of the surfaces that swimmers use for balance. As with floating on your back, the next skill to master is floating on your front while bringing your legs together. Specifically, repeat the same skill, but this time keep your arms out while bringing your legs together to make a T rather than a starfish (figure 1.5). This skill requires a little more control and ability to relax on the water. Figure 1.5 Front Floating in a t Position Preparation Execution 1. Begin by checking the water 1.

The sWimming PosiTion The last skills in this step involve using your newfound balance in the water to achieve a swimming position and to master the art of reducing drag force. A good swimming position requires a great deal of balance and a solid foundation that ena- bles you to apply force to the water. As discussed earlier, it is critical to locate your center of balance and be comfortable in the water. Return for a moment to the teeter-totter analogy and the fact that your center of buoyancy lies

Perform this drill on a sunny day on a pool deck, either next to a wall or in a location where you can see your shadow on the deck. Assume the streamlined position as described earlier and look at your shadow for visual feedback. Try different ways of making your shadow as narrow as possible. to incrEasE Difficulty • Look at the streamline both from the side and from the front.

More specifically, you have learned and practiced drills that create a solid foundation for swimming and for applying force to the water in order to move through it efficiently. You have also learned about the importance of using the streamlined position to reduce drag. In addition, the drills and skills included in this step have led you to be more comfortable in the water, especially in positions that are not natural in most of your nonaquatic life. Being relaxed and comfortable is a key factor in the remaining steps to swimming success. You are well on your way to success in swimming if you have mastered the following skills: 1.

to apply pressure than air does. Swimmers can take advantage of this density by using 21 --- Page 41 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success propulsive force to their advantage. Specifically, they apply pressure to the water in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction in which they want to go. Think of it this way: When you exit the pool, you place your hands on the pool deck in a horizontal position—that is, perpendicular to the direction (up) in which you want to go. As you apply pressure downward, your body rises above the position where it started. Now, mentally rotate these dynamics from the vertical to the horizontal and envision pressing against water instead of against the pool deck, and you have the basic concept of using propulsive force for swimming. For another analogy, consider rockets, which are powered by massive propulsive force and resisted by relatively little drag force because they are long and skinny. Similarly, as discussed in step 1 of this book, a swimmer is well advised to assume a long, thin shape with good balance. Here in step 2, it is time to apply propulsive force. Now that you have reduced drag force by becoming streamlined, you can move on to using propulsive force by putting pressure on the water in an appropriate way. MiniMizing Drag Learning to minimize your “drag profile” takes repetition and some minor adjust- ments. As in step 1, in which you achieved balance in a streamlined position, you now start by ensuring that you are as long and narrow (i.e., as rocketlike) as possible. In order to feel the effects of drag and minimize their influence, repeat the push-off drill but add some new elements, starting with the manner in which you push off. The following few instructions

now start by ensuring that you are as long and narrow (i.e., as rocketlike) as possible. In order to feel the effects of drag and minimize their influence, repeat the push-off drill but add some new elements, starting with the manner in which you push off. The following few instructions provide a sequence that not only helps you under- stand how drag affects swimming but also reinforces your ability to balance in the water (figure 2.1). For the first part of this sequence, position yourself in shallow water at the pool wall. This is the only time in the sequence that you will get to push against something solid, so make it count! Tips for MiniMizing Drag 1. Posture is important. Make yourself as long as you can, from fingertips to toe tips. Doing so includes really stretching and pointing your toes! 2. Avoid the “Superman flying position” in which your hands are separated and your arms are parallel to each other. If you are trying to be narrow, stack your hands one on top of the other as in the Torpedo drill in step 1. A point at the front and at the back is best. Hydrodynamics tells us that you want to be long and skinny so pierce the water and let it flow off a single point at the end as well. 3. Your head is your rudder. If you keep your head down and your neck long, you will go farther. This position is also worth practicing for another reason: it is not far from your ideal front-swimming position. 22 --- Page 42 Text --- Manipulating the Water Figure 2.1 MiniMizing Drag a b Preparation Execution 1.

Wait until your hands touch underwater and you are completely sub- merged, then push. 23 --- Page 43 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success MissTeP You spear up quickly through the top of the water. correcTion Think about where your head is. This misstep is likely to occur if you look at your hands during the push-off. If you look down at the pool bottom or even tuck your chin to your chest, you will be able to stay under. MissTeP You don’t go very far. correcTion Distance traveled differs from person to person. We come in different sizes and shapes, and some swimmers will go farther than others. Keep at it, and those little adjustments will make a difference! ProPulsive Force: DeveloPing The caTch anD The Pull Swim coaches regularly use the terms catch and pull. Roughly, catch means where you anchor your hand or any other frontal surface in the water; it applies to all strokes. Pull refers to the motion that comes immediately after the catch to provide propulsive force. In this step, you work on the general feeling of putting pressure on the water but not on the specific movement patterns for each stroke. That work comes in later steps. The caTch Manipulating the water across all strokes is a key to good swimming. As part of this process, all strokes include a catch phase (figure 2.2), in which the key surface (whether in the form of one hand or both hands) enters the water and begins to get perpendic- ular to the direction in which you are going. For a mental representation of the catch phase, swimmers think about anchoring the hand

Success MissTeP You splash the water a lot. correcTion You can put effective pressure on the water only with your hands in the water. Avoid slapping the top of the water or pushing at the top. MissTeP You push down with your palm toward the bottom of the pool. correcTion To provide propulsive force, get your hand (and as many other arm surfaces as possible) perpendicular to the direction in which you want to go. Drill For The caTch The best way to develop kinesthetic awareness or feel for the water is to practice in-water drills that minimize other factors. The best drill for this is the dig. Catch Drill Dig This three-part drill is best done in water in which you can stand. Using a stopwatch, measure how long it takes you to walk as fast as you can from one end of the pool to the other; record your time. Then repeat the walking exercise, but this time also use your hands to sweep water out of your way laterally, as if plowing the water one arm movement at a time. Once again, record your time. Next, use an overhand over-the- water motion to accomplish the same task and record your time. Which technique works best for you? (Simply walking should produce your slowest time.) Could you feel your hands anchoring in the water and pulling forward? You might repeat the drill a few times to ensure that you have done it correctly. To increase DiFFiculTy • Pull forcefully with your hands. • Pull quickly with your hands. To Decrease DiFFiculTy • Walk at an easy pace, letting your hands provide balance. • Use both arms at the same time. 26 --- Page 46 Text --- Manipulating the Water Success Check Score Your Success • You can make

water. With your hands in a natural, relaxed position and slightly cupped, rotate your thumbs down so that your palms are angled slightly rather than parallel to the pool bottom. Next, sweep your hands outward, making sure to keep your elbows straight. You should feel pressure from the water on your hands and forearms. Once your hands are about 2 feet (0.6 m) apart, rotate your thumbs up and your little fingers down so that, once again, your palms are slightly angled—only this time toward each other rather than away—and move your arms back to the original position. Again, keep your elbows straight. Repeat this motion several times and adjust the pitch of your palms to get a good feel for the water. As you progress, angle your fingers down slightly as well. The sculling motion creates higher pressure on the palm side of your hand and lower pressure on the back of your hand, thus providing propulsive force. 27 --- Page 47 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 2.3 sculling Preparation 1.

MissTeP You keep your hands very stiff. correcTion Relax your hands and feel the water. MissTeP You don’t go anywhere when sculling. correcTion Make sure that your hands are slightly cupped, which provides the same high-pressure and low-pressure propulsion as propellers and airplane wings. Water will flow faster over the top part of the hand as it has a greater distance to travel, and the inside arc of the hand has a smaller linear distance, so the water remains easier to hold. The faster moving water on the top of the hand is low pressure, and the palm would be higher pressure. To achieve equilibrium, the barrier (i.e., the hand) will move toward the lower pressure. 28 --- Page 48 Text --- Manipulating the Water Drill For sculling Use the following drill to help practice the sculling skill. Sculling Drill sculling With a Pull Buoy Next, put this skill to work in a swimming position. Place a pull buoy between your legs slightly above your knees. Lie flat and facedown on the water in a neutral posi- tion, as described in step 1, with your arms extended above your head. Keep your hands relaxed, with your fingers pitched slightly downward, and slowly try the scull- ing motion until you feel yourself being pulled forward. This is a complex skill that takes time to master. It requires movements that are not fast, rigid, or mechanical but slow, controlled, and fluid. Use slow, rhythmic move- ments and make sure that your hands never stop; they should be sweeping either out or in at any given time. Failure to master this skill does

perform a good start. In competitive swimming, starting involves performing a sequence of movements to generate as much velocity as possible down the length of the pool. After all, this is the last chance to push against something solid (until the turn) and to benefit from gravity, so it pays to make the most of it. For all of the strokes covered in this book, the start consists of four basic elements: 1) set, 2) push, 3) entry, and 4) streamline. The set is the posture that you take on the side of the pool or on the starting block. The push is the explosive movement that generates velocity down the pool. The entry is the transition into the water, and the streamline is how you carry that momentum into the water in order to use it as swimming speed. In-Water StartS Of course, many swimmers do not compete, but start skills are still important for them. Beginners and others who cannot dive should look at the sections addressing the streamline and the breakout in the stroke-specific discussions. In-water starts involve simply pushing off from the wall, and they are perfectly legal in most com- petitions. The rules do specify that you must have at least one hand on the wall and must push off of the wall rather than contacting the bottom of the pool. DIve StartS Before you begin this step, make certain that the pool you are using is a safe place to perform a dive start. Many pools either restrict diving or are not deep enough for diving at all. Check with the lifeguard or your instructor to ensure that this particular activity is appropriate at your pool. Depth requirements vary from governing body to governing body, but all require at least 4.5 feet (~1.4 m);

to the proper entry position. KneelIng DIve The first part of the progression is the kneeling dive (figure 8.1). During this part, many swimmers place a towel on the deck to protect their knees. Repeat the process several times before moving on; each time, try to enter through the “hole” that your hands make in the water. Figure 8.1 KneelIng DIve Set 1. Kneel at the edge of the pool deck facing the water on one knee and your other leg up and the toes of that foot wrapped around the edge of the deck or coping. 2.

CorreCtIon Adjust how far out you point your hands as you roll into the water. DIve-Start equIpMent Before transitioning from the deck to the starting block, there are few things to consider. First, not every facility has starting blocks, and those that do often place restrictions on who is allowed to use them and under what circumstances. If you are permitted to use the block—and if you have successful experience in diving from the side of the pool—then you may want to begin working from the block. Starting blocks traditionally stand 20 to 30 inches (0.5-0.75 m) above the water. This may not seem like a great height, but it adds a lot of energy to the start and makes pool depth all the more important. Though traditionally performed from a starting block, this forward dive start can also be done from the side of the pool. Starting blocks may be either removable or permanently installed. They come in a variety

your entry a little farther from the block. DrIllS For ForWarD or grab Start Performing a good forward start depends on your ability to generate a great deal of horizontal force and maintain the velocity generated by pushing off of something solid from a significant height. The following drills help you master the forward start by emphasizing each component of a good start. Forward or Grab Start Drill 1 Standing Jump This feetfirst drill isolates the push to help you generate explosive power from either the pool deck or a starting block. From the take-your-mark position, instead of pulling forward with your hands, let go and swing your arms forward. At the same time, push forward as forcefully as possible to get as much forward velocity as you can, then pull your feet up to enter the water feetfirst. Practice this drill several times to see how far down the pool you can get. In competition, start sequencing may vary in several ways. Most meets use whistle commands. First, a series of short whistles from the starter or another official calls com- petitors to the block. A long whistle then signals them to step up on the block (or into the water in the case of backstroke) and get ready to assume the start position. The starter then tells competitors to take their marks, at which time they need to get into the start position and hold it. The start of the race itself is signaled by a horn or whistle. 166 --- Page 186 Text --- Starts to InCreaSe DIFFICulty • Place a marker (e.g., a diving brick) on the bottom of the pool as a target and aim for the spot in the water directly above it. to DeCreaSe DIFFICulty • Start from the deck and just do

in your streamline to ensure that you can manage the breakout effectively. MISStep You look up, lose your balance, and fall in. CorreCtIon Keep your neck loose; looking at the end of the pool constricts blood vessels in the neck. MISStep You rock back too far and sit on your back leg. CorreCtIon Having the hips slightly forward or back is common and often merely a matter of preference. However, a knee bend of more than 90 degrees does not allow for a good push. Move your hips forward. MISStep Your front leg is straight and locked out. CorreCtIon Make sure that you bend your knee so that you have some way of pushing off of the block with your lead leg rather than just your foot. 170 --- Page 190 Text --- Starts DrIllS For the traCK Start The next few drills focus on connecting all of the skills of the set, push, entry, and breakout streamline into one integrated skill. Track Start Drill 1 15-Meter Though not really a drill, this exercise enables you to determine which start is best for you. Try the grab start and record your time at 15 yards. Do the same for the track start with each leg serving as the forward leg. Do this sequence several times to determine which type of start is best for you. In competition pools, the 15-yard mark is signified by an off-color (e.g., red or yellow) disk as part of the lane line. If the pool does not have such a mark, you can use any measured distance beyond 10 yards. Track Start Drill 2 Standing Jump This drill isolates the push portion of the start. From the take-your-mark position, push forward as forcefully as possible to get as much forward velocity as you can. Then

you try these drills. Rest assured that the more you do them, the more comfortable you get. Backstroke Curl Drill 1 back Flip One of the most difficult parts of the start is to avoid a flat or pancake start. Foot posi- tioning will allow you to produce maximum force horizontally down the pool. Some years ago, many swimmers—the rules allowed this—curled their toes over the gutter to get a little extra vertical force to almost do a back dive into the water. While you are not allowed to curl your toes over the gutter or deck, it is a good idea to place your feet as close as you can to the top of the water. This drill is performed by throwing your hands and arms back, almost as if trying to touch the bottom of the pool behind you. This action requires you to arch your back more than you do on a regular start. You must also attend to your head position- ing; specifically, make sure to look back toward the bottom of the pool behind you. If you end up vertical with your head down, then you have done the drill correctly.

traces its history back to ancient times, when pool swimming did not exist but of course both large and small bodies of water did. Whether for sport or survival, then, this is where the bloodline of all swimming begins. Although open-water swimming and pool swimming share similar stroke skills, they are completely different sports in many ways. For one thing, pool swimming takes place in a very controlled environment with a set distance and controlled water and air temperatures. In contrast, open-water and survival swimming take place in settings affected by variable environmental factors. This step focuses on skills and drills that are important for both competitive and recreational open-water swim- ming, as well as those that can help you in an emergency. Before you start, review the following safety principles, which applies to all types of open-water swimming, whether for competition, recreation, or survival. 1. Never swim alone. 2. Be aware of environmental factors. 3. Plan your swim and make your plan known to others. 4. Take all appropriate safety equipment and make sure that it is in good work- ing order. 183 --- Page 203 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Open-Water SWimming: the envirOnment The first consideration for any open-water swim is the environment, which includes air and water temperatures, weather, surface conditions, currents, geography (of both the shore and the water beneath the surface), water quality, and any wildlife in the area. (See figure 9.1 for a basic open-water course.) Air temperature plays a role not only in the potential for hypothermia when you get out of the water but also in how quickly a body of water cools. In addition, large differences between air tem- perature and water temperature stress the body because the body requires energy to regulate temperature. Of course, water temperature itself

only in the potential for hypothermia when you get out of the water but also in how quickly a body of water cools. In addition, large differences between air tem- perature and water temperature stress the body because the body requires energy to regulate temperature. Of course, water temperature itself is also of great concern. Water starts feeling cold to most people around 81 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) and too warm at about 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius). In international competitions, water temperatures are required to be between about 61 and 88 degrees Fahrenheit (16 and 31 degrees Celsius). Competitions with cooler temperatures often allow com- petitors to use wetsuits for warmth rather than requiring traditional bathing suits. Turn buoy Finish Start 750 meter course 1.5K course Figure 9.1 Basic open-water course. E6544/Bay/fig 9.04/534233/kh/R2-alw Another environmental concern for open-water swimming is the weather. A good swim depends in part on good planning in relation to sunrise and sunset times, as well as the weather forecast for the area. Swimming in the dark is never recom- mended because of increased animal activity, less visibility, and colder tempera- tures. Open-water swimmers should also avoid inclement weather, including rain and especially thunderstorms. Fog is also a concern because it impedes navigation and can create an emergency for an otherwise accomplished swimmer. 184 --- Page 204 Text --- Open-Water and Survival Swimming Open-water swimmers must also consider surface conditions when planning a swim. This is especially true of larger bodies of water, in which waves and swells can be problematic; however, it is also true for smaller bodies of water, in which even a light chop of small waves can create an issue. Swells and chop are often caused by wind, but they can also be produced by other factors, such as

in which waves and swells can be problematic; however, it is also true for smaller bodies of water, in which even a light chop of small waves can create an issue. Swells and chop are often caused by wind, but they can also be produced by other factors, such as upwellings and tidal changes. Another—and often neglected—aspect of surface conditions involves traffic. It is not recommended that you swim in an area of high boat traffic; interactions between watercraft and swimmers usually end poorly for the swimmer. There may also be surface debris, such as sticks, logs, and trash. An open-water swim plan must also take account of currents and of the geog- raphy—both of the bottom of the body of water and of the immediate shoreline. A swimmer can be carried offshore by a rip current or downstream by river flow, and either situation is dangerous. Therefore, it is crucial to know about any currents or tides, including their strength and direction of flow. As for geography, consider all possible factors. For example, is there a shallow entry or a drop-off? How deep is the water? Is the shore sandy or rocky? Is there any vegetation? In addition, when swimming in a body of water other than a pool (and sometimes even in a pool!), you will encounter some form of biological life. It could be as simple as bacteria, moss, or algae or as complex and intimidating as fish, jellyfish, reptiles, or mammals. This caveat is not meant to discourage you from enjoying a swim in the open water but to stress the importance of knowing what you are getting into. Check with local officials to make sure that your intended swimming location is free from harmful bacteria and other potentially dangerous life forms. Consider also the fact

At the point where it is too difficult to continue wading, bring your arms to the front a and push forward off of the bottom. 2. Keep your hands in front, let your feet leave the bottom, and push your chest forward. This approach allows you to cover more horizontal dis- tance with less energy than walking. 3. Pull one knee up, find the bottom with that foot again, and repeat the upper-body motion as you draw your other leg past the first leg. 4. Repeat as often as neces- b sary to reach a swimming depth. The preceding skill is practiced in a zero-entry pool, but it can also be used at an open-water venue, as shown in the photos. The zero-entry pool is safer, and many skills can be practiced there first prior to open-water trials. The following missteps and corrections are for performing the drills in an open-water environment. miSStep You run into the water and promptly fall flat after tripping on a rock.

This motion brings your hips to the surface, and you can push your chin forward until you are in a horizontal swimming position while taking your first stroke. 187 --- Page 207 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success drillS FOr FeetFirSt entry Feetfirst entry is always the safest way to go, even when you can see the bottom or know the water depth. The advantages of this entry include keeping your head near the surface, or even above the water, if necessary due to cold or dirty conditions, for example, or to keep an eye on a target in the water. Entry and Start Drill 1 Compact-Jump entry and Swim This drill helps you learn to get into the water from a dock or boat and immediately begin swimming. The object of the drill is to keep your body close to the surface and get to a horizontal position quickly and effectively. The drill requires you to find progressively shallower parts of the pool, down to 3.5 feet (~1 m). Find a suitable pool or body of water, check for any obstructions, and make sure that the conditions are safe. To do the drill, perform the entry as described earlier. Standing on the side of the pool (or dock or boat), face the direction in which you are going to swim. Jump out away

Moreover, much of the world’s open water provides you with only a few feet of visibility (if that), which limits the value of lifting your head for vision, especially since doing so can compromise your body position. In addition, without the benefit of a pool marking, most swimmers tend to pull to one side or the other, thus com- pounding the problem of navigation and encouraging you to look up more often than you need to. 191 --- Page 211 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Combine these factors with challenging wind, waves, or currents and you can end up all over the place. To make matters worse, the buoys that mark open-water courses are often are hard to see. In many cases, therefore, it is better to find a more prominent landmark on an opposite shore or some other stationary object to assure you that you are swimming straight (figure 9.4). Here are a few skills and drills to help you ensure that you swim in the right direction. Figure 9.4 In open-water swimming, it’s best to use a prominent landmark when sighting and navigating.

The positioning differs as well. In cycling and auto racing, the ideal draft position is often behind the lead cyclist or driver, but this is not true of swimming. In swimming, the swimmers can be off to the side. To practice your position and drafting skills, use the following drills. Pack-Swimming Drill 1 three-person drafting In a 25-yard pool, work with two other swimmers. Start one right after another and have the second and third swimmers get into drafting position.

The extended arm sweeps down, with the elbow bent, to about the mid body; whereas the arm closest to the surface sneaks up along the body. The hands meet, and the arm closest to the surface then pushes back down toward the thigh while the other arm sneaks forward.

If you have found greater confidence in the water as you have progressed through the steps in this book, it is time to explore options for continuing your swimming, whether for recreation or for competition. The first part of the process involves finding a place to swim regularly. Many parks and recreation departments maintain swimming pools that are open to the public on at least a seasonal basis. Other places to search include the YMCA, YWCA, Jewish Community Centers, fitness clubs, swim clubs, schools, and health and well- ness centers. Key considerations include schedule, quality of facilities, staff, and, of course, cost. The next part of the process involves practicing the skills that you have already mastered and building on them. The sport of swimming depends on skill-based movement, and it is often helpful to go all the way back to the beginning to review what you have done and see where you can make improvements. Now that you have been through the process once—and gained a new level of confidence in the water— it would be a good idea to go back through the steps and make sure that you get them right at the highest level of which you are capable. Goal SettinG Goal setting is an important part of any healthy lifestyle, whether it is done for fit- ness, recreation, or competition. Regardless of what area of life you are addressing, goal setting gives you direction and focus. It helps shape your decision making, not

they often involve either distance or time or both. Many recreational swimmers are also seeking to do a first triathlon or perhaps just become able to swim a certain distance or swim for a certain amount of time. These swimmers need to set a goal to get them out of bed for a morning workout or help them be sure to swing by the pool on the way home from work. In other examples, a person might set a goal of obtaining scuba certification or getting fit enough to keep up with active peers. Swimmers in this cat- egory also set goals for becoming more comfortable in the water and more efficient in their movements. If you have found that you excel in a given stroke, then you may wish to think about competing. Competitive goals tend to be tightly focused, and they vary widely from swimmer to swimmer. For example, some swimmers aim to do better in the swim portion of a local triathlon, whereas others want to compete in open-water or pool-based events. The best and most focused goals are based on measurable criteria, such as performing a specific stroke for a specific time and distance. This type of goal is much different from, say, setting a general goal of winning. How to Do It Well Regardless of whether you are a fitness, recreational, or competitive swimmer, your goals should be challenging and motivating. Many people have found that they set more effective goals if they use a system based on the acronym SMART. The S in SMART stands for specific, which means that the goal should include meaningful detail about activity, time, location, and requirements. A vague goal might read like this: “I am going to start swimming more.” In contrast, a more spe- cific goal might

system based on the acronym SMART. The S in SMART stands for specific, which means that the goal should include meaningful detail about activity, time, location, and requirements. A vague goal might read like this: “I am going to start swimming more.” In contrast, a more spe- cific goal might read like this: “I am going to swim three or more times per week.” This kind of specificity is useful in fitness, recreational, and competitive swimming. The M in SMART stands for measurable. Setting measurable goals helps you hold yourself accountable and motivates you when you reach milestones by giving you a sense of accomplishment. The key here is to determine what you are trying to meas- ure. For example, a fitness swimmer might track number of swims, a recreational swimmer might track distance covered, and a competitive swimmer might track times. The A stands for achievable. It may be inspirational to think that you can do any- thing you set your mind to, but it is often more effective to set short-term goals that are attainable on your way to achieving a long-term ambition. Achievable goals serve as milestones on your path to a bigger goal. The best part is that the more often you achieve meaningful goals, the better you get at developing the skills, personal attrib- utes, mind-set, and habits that lead you to bigger goals. The R stands for realistic. When setting goals, you should always be honest with yourself. For example, if you have just started swimming and have mastered all of the strokes presented in this book, then you might set a realistic goal of swimming a mile (1.6 km) without stopping within the next year. An example of an unrealistic goal would be trying to make the U.S. national swim team in the

An example of an unrealistic goal would be trying to make the U.S. national swim team in the next six months. Granted, this is a dramatic example, but it can in fact be a tricky thing to set a realistic 216 --- Page 236 Text --- Continuing With Swimming goal. Make it too easy and there is no challenge; a result, meeting your goals may ring hollow. Make it too challenging and you may get frustrated with the process and move on to something else. Finally, the T stands for time—that is, identifying a specific time period in which you want to accomplish your goal. This is the part of your goal that gets you out of bed on a cold morning or motivates you to squeeze in a swim over lunch. You are typ- ically happy later on for doing so, but many of us can rationalize many reasons to skip what we know is good for us in exchange for an extra 10 minutes of sleep or a slice of pizza or scoop of ice cream. Mind you, these things are not necessarily bad in their proper place, but a time-limited goal keeps your focus on what you want to achieve and when you want to get it done. Simply saying “I want to lose weight” has no real meaning in terms of time, but saying “I want to lose five pounds by January 1” puts the goal on the clock and is much more likely to change your behavior. Following Up on Goals Once you achieve a goal, what comes next? In competitive swimming, the

has no real meaning in terms of time, but saying “I want to lose five pounds by January 1” puts the goal on the clock and is much more likely to change your behavior. Following Up on Goals Once you achieve a goal, what comes next? In competitive swimming, the answer is easy because the next goal can always be set by the clock. In contrast, fitness and recreational swimmers might focus on doing more frequent swims or even having a go at competitive swimming. Regardless of how you frame the issue, have your next goal ready when you achieve your current one. In addition, make time to celebrate your achievements. Reward and recognition are very motivating, especially when the rewards are intrinsic. FindinG a ProGram Various programs are available, and the right choice depends on your goals. For exam- ple, if you are a fitness or recreational swimmer, you may not need a lot of structure; in fact, you may find great satisfaction in accomplishing everything on your own. Due to the technical nature of the sport, however, most people need a support group or pro- gram to help them along. Many large metropolitan areas are home to a diverse group of swimming programs; smaller areas may have fewer options. In either case, certain questions can help you decide whether to join a program or continue on your own. Two big considerations are program schedule and program structure. If the pro- gram’s schedule does not fit yours, this need not necessarily be end of the conversa- tion with that facility. Ask if the staff would consider offering a program at a time that works better for you. Many swimmers just accept a schedule as it is posted and move on if it doesn’t work for them, but sometimes a

not necessarily be end of the conversa- tion with that facility. Ask if the staff would consider offering a program at a time that works better for you. Many swimmers just accept a schedule as it is posted and move on if it doesn’t work for them, but sometimes a facility manager is simply unaware of the demand for a different time slot. If a number of swimmers show up at the pool at the same time you prefer, go ahead and ask the management about starting a new offering or expanding an existing one. The structure of the program is also a consideration. Some programs just have a workout leader who swims the workout and provides minimal feedback. Others are more instructive, providing a teacher in the water or on the deck who can give individual feedback and really help participants improve. Still other programs have a full-time professional coach on the deck who helps swimmers both with workout considerations and with stroke improvement. The most instructive setup, of course, is the lesson environment. A careful review of your experience with this book can help you identify what type of program is best suited to your needs and goals. 217 --- Page 237 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success ChooSinG a CoaCh or inStruCtor This process involves a number of factors, all of which focus on you; indeed, swim- ming programs exist not because of coaches or instructors but because of swimmers. As in any profession, there are good coaches and instructors, and there are poor ones. In addition, what works for one swimmer may not work for another. As much as possible, your choice should be dictated by your goals and your level of proficiency. For any swimmer, the introduction to a program, coach, or instructor should always

coaches and instructors, and there are poor ones. In addition, what works for one swimmer may not work for another. As much as possible, your choice should be dictated by your goals and your level of proficiency. For any swimmer, the introduction to a program, coach, or instructor should always start with a conversation. If yours is a new face on the pool deck, then you can expect someone from the program to greet you. Hopefully, that person does a short interview and asks about your swimming background. The best bet is to be honest so that the coach or instructor gets a good idea of what you want and need. It is also a good idea to ask him or her plenty of questions. Here are a few exam- ples: What is your coaching philosophy? How do you integrate new people into the group? And what is the fee for the program? As for program content, some coaches and instructors take a workout-oriented approach, whereas others focus more on instruction. Neither approach is necessarily better than the other; again, it depends on your goals. The nature of a good coach or instructor may vary from one person’s opinion to another, but certain characteristics are shared by all great coaches in any sport. First, they care—not only about the sport and its highest-level athletes but also about help- ing every athlete they encounter, regardless of level or goals, to love the sport and continually seek improvement. They put effort into each athlete and each session while also working to make themselves better. This is what coaching grit is all about. If one method doesn’t work, they try another—and another and another—until they are successful with each athlete. Nor are they afraid to ask for help from a colleague; in fact,

each athlete and each session while also working to make themselves better. This is what coaching grit is all about. If one method doesn’t work, they try another—and another and another—until they are successful with each athlete. Nor are they afraid to ask for help from a colleague; in fact, the best coaches do this all the time. They are committed to helping athletes achieve their goals, which is why they are themselves successful. Where do you find these programs and people? Read on. SWimminG reSourCeS The next part of your journey into the wider world of swimming is to look for resources to help you become a better swimmer. Of course, several resources are available from Human Kinetics that are part of the aquatics department. There are also multimedia resources, such as videos and other instructional media. A word of caution: Most anyone can “publish” most anything on the web, which means that you need to exer- cise a critical eye in selecting swimming materials. The most reputable sources for additional instruction are the national governing bodies that work with aquatics, from the very young to the most senior members of the aquatics community. Through these organizations, you can find numerous resources, including in-person coaching. USA Swimming (www.usaswimming.org) is the governing body that regulates U.S. swimming for age groups from eight and under all the way through elite inter- national competition, including the Olympics. USA Swimming is governed primarily by volunteers, and contact can be made through Local Swimming Committees (LSCs) since the organization is structured geographically. Simply access the USA Swimming website, which will put you in touch with local resources to help you along on your swimming journey if you are looking for a very high level of competition or access to coaches at this level. 218

Committees (LSCs) since the organization is structured geographically. Simply access the USA Swimming website, which will put you in touch with local resources to help you along on your swimming journey if you are looking for a very high level of competition or access to coaches at this level. 218 --- Page 238 Text --- Continuing With Swimming U.S. Masters Swimming (www.usms.org) is dedicated to providing adults 18 years old and over with access to health, wellness, fitness, and competition through aquatics. Adults seeking resources (e.g., workout plans and additional instruction) can look here to find programs for aquatics at every level in their local area. Like USA Swimming, this organization depends on volunteers and operates in the same manner—in this case, through Local Masters Swimming Committees (LMSCs). Another national governing body that deals with adult aquatics and fitness on a variety of levels in USA Triathlon (www.usatriathlon.org). This organization addresses all ages and, since one of the disciplines of triathlon is swimming, it can provide you with a number of opportunities to continue your swimming if you choose multisport racing for fitness or competition. In addition to national governing bodies, there are a number of professional swim teaching and coaching organizations that you can contact for additional resources. All you need to do is search for them using keywords such as “swim instruction” or “swim lessons.” Many can be found at the same facilities that you are looking at to secure lane space, so you have a convenient way to continue your journey. Swimming is a great sport for health, wellness, and competition; it is also a life skill in that it can mean surviving an emergency situation.
