With one end of the stretch band anchored at the elbow level to the left of the body, hold the other end of the band in the left hand outside the body, with the elbow bent to 90 degrees and held firm to the side of the body. Swing the lower arm inward as if it were a door closing. Recover along the same path. Close and open repeatedly. Anchor stretch band to the right of the body and repeat motion with the right arm. Back Scrubber — With the length of the stretch band folded in half, hold one end of the stretch band in the left hand and raise the hand over your head, palm back, then drop the elbow down so the stretch band dangles down the back. With the right hand, reach down behind the back and grasp the other end of the stretch band. Gently pull the band up with the left hand, then down with the right hand repeatedly, as if scrubbing the back. Repeat with hands in opposite positions. 85 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 85 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 88 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming EXERCISE MACHINES Exercise machines provide a great aerobic component to a land-based routine, raising the heart rate and contributing to endurance. Many are valuable for developed athletes as a warm-up before lifting weights or performing other strength training activities. A few contribute additional opportunities for building force and explosiveness as well. As they are designed for adult frames, they should not be used by young children. The best exercise machines for warm-ups are listed below: Exercise Bike — A stationary bicycle that can be set at various resistances. Comes in reclining or upright models.

frames, they should not be used by young children. The best exercise machines for warm-ups are listed below: Exercise Bike — A stationary bicycle that can be set at various resistances. Comes in reclining or upright models. Either model is good, but with the upright model, use without holding handlebars for good stabilization practice. 86 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 86 12.07.11 12:12 --- OCR from Page 88 Image 2 --- OS QO \ HES ae --- Page 89 Text --- Let’s Get Specific Elliptical Trainer — A machine with pedals that move in an elliptical cycle and, along with an adjustable incline, simulate running without impact. Some models come with arm levers that alternate, and these are preferable for a good full-body warm-up. Treadmill — A machine with a moving ramp that can be adjusted to different speeds and inclines for walking and running. Use without holding handrails for good stabilization practice. Additional beneficial exercise machines for swimmers include: Swim Bench — Replicates swimming motion, including accelerating movement, and encourages correct technique against more resistance than the water provides. It also encourages the swimmer to accelerate move- ments throughout each exertion. Erg — Also known as the rowing machine, the erg builds force and power very well, closely replicating the full-body requirements of rowing, which in many ways are similar to swimming. 87 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 87 12.07.11 12:12 --- OCR from Page 89 Image 2 --- ay) --- Page 90 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming WEIGHTS Weightlifting is recommended only for athletes who have reached the young adult stage of development. Real consequences can occur when weights are used too early in a swimmer’s development. It is not a myth! Growth plates in young developing swimmers can be damaged under the load of weights. When a swimmer is

Wearing Shoes Although most swimmers are very comfortable in bare feet around the pool deck, shoes should be mandatory for any strength training activity involving external weight or moving with impact on the feet. While many exercises can be done safely without shoes on the pool deck or gym, it is never acceptable to be barefoot in the weight room where obstacles are many or when using any exercise machine with moving parts. Self-resistance work that involves running, jumping, or changing directions can put excessive pressure on bare feet. Shoes will provide support as well as protection from sharp objects hidden in grass and rough surfaces. 101 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 101 12.07.11 12:13 --- OCR from Page 103 Image 1 --- NO RUNNING NO DIVING --- Page 104 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Tying Hair Back Long hair back should be tied back to ensure good visibility at all times and to avoid entanglement in machines. WARM-UP The purpose of warming up before strength training is exactly the same as at the beginning of a swimming workout. Warming up prepares the body to work by loosening up and activating the muscles, and raising the heart rate to circulate oxygen-rich blood to the muscles. Swimmers should spend at least a quarter of their strength training time warming up. Good warm-up activities include: • Relaxed Arm Circles • Hanging Arm Circles • Cherry Pickers • Jumping Jacks • Running • Skipping • Side Steps • Stairs • Skating • Jump Rope 102 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 102 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 105 Text --- The Fundamentals TAKE IT EASY ON THE STRETCHING!

perform. It will also keep you from fatiguing as quickly. CONTROL It is important to control every movement against resistance, both in the power phase and recovery. Always maintain balance and stability during the power phase. Always return to the starting position gently and with less speed. Never allow an external load to jerk the limbs back to the starting position. 105 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 105 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 108 Text --- 106 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 106 12.07.11 12:13 --- OCR from Page 108 Image 1 --- PEN SARA ANCA IN . z --- Page 109 Text --- Routines and Circuits 7 ROUTINES AND CIRCUITS This section contains strength training routines and circuits for all stages of development. Because the six stages of development identified earlier in this book are not isolated but are more of a continuum, merging one into the next, the routines and circuits are presented in four progressive levels with specific content to meet particular developmental objectives. Use these routines and circuits as examples for structure and content, then tailor them to the needs of the individual swimmer. Check with your health care provider before starting a strength training program. STRENGTH TRAINING ROUTINES The following routines are presented in a sequence beginning with a warm-up and ending with a cool down. When a double space appears, extra rest should be taken. 107 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 107 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 110 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming LEVEL 1 ROUTINES These routines are appropriate for athletes at the elementary stage of development and older athletes at the beginning level. 108 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 108 12.07.11 12:13 --- OCR from Page 110 Image 1 --- fated ee 4 sane eeen ‘rrrreress ss aia a ae at a ott om Ms sce at taceaee fs oat

The good news is that after just a few weeks of introducing some training sets to your swimming you will take some good steps forward in swim specific fitness, which will make all of your swimming feel easier and so your time in the water much more enjoyable.

Following this structure helps you to break down a session and attain the right split between the warm-up, drills, heart rate build sets, main sets and cool-downs. In this example we will use a total distance of 3.0 km for the session as an indicator for how much of each component you should look to include. You might normally only cover half this distance in your own training sessions, or you might cover more, in any case use this as a starting guide of what to include and when: The session board for a Swim Smooth squad session at Claremont pool.

Build set totalling 200 m to 500 m — these shorter sets are designed to elevate the heart rate and prepare you for a more active main set. 3. Main set totalling 1200 m to 2000 m — this set can focus on different areas, including technique and drills, shorter endurance work, speed sets, threshold development or open water skills. We will look at these more closely in this chapter. 4. Cool-down totalling 100 m to 400 m — this is an important component of any session and should be included as a way of reducing the heart rate, flushing the body of lactate build up and to generally loosen off and feel good in your stroke. Using this simple structure is an easy way to create some wonderfully engaging training sessions. To help get you started with this, in Appendix C we have listed six variations of each component which are loosely aimed at each of the six Swim Types. Use them to construct your own training sessions and so perfectly balance your technique, fitness and open water skills work. You can follow any of the sets for any other Swim Type, they will all be

to become a mantra of our marathon swimming squad! For those swimmers and triathletes attempting longer distance events (e.g. open water events longer than 2.5 km and triathletes training for a full Ironman), long continuous swims are a nice way of building your confidence that you can cover your target race distance. Later in Chapter 27 we will show you how to calculate the pace to hold for these swims so that you develop your base endurance whilst maintaining good form and technique. A classic mistake swimmers make with long continuous swims is to start too fast and then fade towards the end. Breaking down these endurance swims into a series of longer intervals with a short rest in-between will help you maintain focus and motivation and also give you a chance to take on board fluid and nutrition for swims over 45 minutes in length. Fuelling correctly in longer sessions is critical to your successful completion of these sessions and how quickly you recover afterwards. We will cover some specific fuelling strategies for longer swims in Chapter 32. An example of a simple endurance set might be 6 × 400 m at 75% effort with 30 seconds rest between each interval. Instead of thinking of this as 75% effort, you could swim this as ‘threshold pace plus eight seconds per 100 m’. We will look at this form of pace calculation later in Chapter 27. In Appendix C you will find six specific endurance sessions ranging in distance from 2.5 km to 6 km. These are designed to be completed without using one of the additional warm-up and build set suggestions as the warm-up is included within the main body of these sessions and encourages you to start off at a conservative pace as though you were starting a

We would advise 10—15 minutes of light mobilisation and stretching work as per Chapter 29 before you start these sessions. --- Page 189 Text --- Session Type 3: Threshold or Sustainable Speed Sessions At the heart of any good swim training programme is some dedicated work at threshold speed, often termed ‘race pace’ if your race distance is around 1500 m. Threshold speed is a pace that is tough enough to develop your aerobic capacity but not so strong that significant recovery is required between intervals. Generally speaking, recovery is faster from these sessions than from sets performed at a higher intensity. Developing your ability to swim well at this intensity is a key determinant of how well you will perform in races of 400 m and longer. As we shall see shortly in Chapter 27, we refer to this form of training as ‘CSS’ — short for Critical Swim Speed. PAUL: The ironic thing about this type of training is that as soon as the phrase ‘race pace’ is mentioned by a coach, swimmers act like a red rag to a bull, setting off way faster than they can sustain for the set. Don’t make this mistake yourself, if you do you will soon blow-up and slow down — swimming most of the set at a slower pace than you otherwise could maintain if you had set off at the right pace. If this happens you have greatly harmed the training effect of the session and

using the concept of Functional Threshold Power (FTP) to measure your threshold on the bike in Watts. CSS is the exact same concept but for swimming. In the controlled environment of a swimming pool we don’t need something as fancy as a power meter to measure threshold, it can be defined as a pace per 100 m. As we shall see, rather than performing a 20-minute or 60-minute time trial to find FTP we perform two shorter swims in the pool and perform a calculation to find CSS pace. We recommend performing the CSS test approximately every four weeks to monitor fitness improvements. Once you know your CSS speed (say it is 1:40 / 100 m) you can then calculate your ideal training pace for endurance work (1:48 / 100 m) and for sprint training (1:35 / 100 m). Therefore as your fitness and CSS improves, your whole training plan adapts to keep pushing your fitness forwards. Combining CSS training with an outline skeleton structure (see Chapter 26) provides you with the perfect training routine that has the right mix of training levels, is flexible enough to handle life events and adapts to your fitness levels to keep pushing you forwards. In other words perfect training! Next we will take a look at the test you can use to find your current CSS pace and go on to show you some training sets you can use to improve that pace over time and so become a faster distance swimmer. The CSS Test Follow this procedure to conduct a CSS test: 1. Swim an easy warm-up of between 600 m and 1000 m, including a variety of technique drills and a few short efforts to lift your heart rate. 2. Perform a 400 m time trial from a push (not a

CSS Test Follow this procedure to conduct a CSS test: 1. Swim an easy warm-up of between 600 m and 1000 m, including a variety of technique drills and a few short efforts to lift your heart rate. 2. Perform a 400 m time trial from a push (not a dive), count your laps right and accurately time it! 3. Recover for 10—15 minutes, including some easy laps of swimming to clear waste products from your muscles. 4. Perform a 200 m time trial from a push, again with accurate timing. 5. Easy cool-down. --- Page 199 Text --- ADAM: Remember the anxiety you may feel at the mere mention of the words ‘time trial’! Try to relax during the two swims and see what happens without any preconceptions or pressure. Whatever your times just see them as a stake in the ground at that point in time, the whole idea is that you improve them from here. Some important notes: Remember the test is about your current fitness levels so do not feel tempted to skip the test and put your all-time 200 m and 400 m personal bests into the calculation, unless you have just swum them! Your efforts need to be a true and accurate reflection of what you can currently do for that distance in order to produce a valid CSS figure. Ideally have someone take your splits every 50 m to check your pacing and try to swim each 50 m within a second of the others. Remember that a well-paced effort will feel quite steady at first but build in perceived intensity as it goes on: steady — tempo — hard — very hard. Carefully check that your results make sense, for instance you should have held a faster pace over 200 m than

of this book. If you have a strong sprint background, this type of threshold-based training at CSS pace (Critical Swim Speed) when combined with a lap interval beeper like the Wetronome or Finis Tempo Trainer Pro can really add an exciting and motivating element to your sessions, especially if you find it hard to find anyone to swim with who can push you along at your pace. Set yourself some challenging targets for a set of 200 m intervals for example (e.g. 2:24 / 200 m) and dial in the Wetronome to beep every 18 seconds. Simply aim to be at each 25 m marker each time the beep goes and without realising it you will be half way through a really rewarding hard-fitness set trying to make sure that the little beeper does not get ahead of you! This adds in an element of pace awareness and is very much a technique set in itself – can you survive the entire set holding good form without blowing up? The format for these types of sessions is only limited by your imagination and we have included some of our favourites for you in Appendix C. ∗These distances are our best recommendations for completing this exercise in a 50 m pool – if you are swimming in a 25 m or 25 yd pool, try halving the suggested distances or ensure that your turn is quick and does not disrupt your focus on your catch. --- Page 333 Text --- APPENDIX C Training Sessions About These Training Sessions To create a training session, pick from the training sets in this guide. We’ve provided six of each type to choose from: Warm-up. Build sets. Technique focused main sets. Fresh and fruity (CSS). Long endurance sets (suitable for Ironman and long distance open
