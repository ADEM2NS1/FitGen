drills led by his coach three times a week. Peter’s work ethic was so admirable that he was given a trophy at the team’s annual awards banquet. Peter attended swim meets regularly, holding clearly in his mind the goal of swimming faster than ever before. One day, after placing fifth in his favorite event, the 50 butterfly, he looked at the field of swimmers at the finish and spotted his teammate Allen raising his fist in victory. “Good for him!” Peter thought momentarily as a sense of confusion welled up inside of him and set in. Allen wasn’t a hard worker. He fooled around a lot and snuck out of practice early all the time. How could he have won the race? Peter’s coach approached both his swimmers with enthusiastic congratulations. As they stood side by side, Peter was struck by the fact that his teammate was nearly a head taller than he was. He had never noticed how much Allen had grown or how husky his voice had become. At the end of the meet, he confided in his coach, asking why he wasn’t improving like Allen was. His wise coach pointed out that Peter was progressing and, in fact, had done his best time. He said it was important to be patient and keep up his good training. “Your day will come, Peter,” the coach told him. Peter held on to his coach’s words. Over the next year and a half, Peter trained regularly, both in and out of the water, developing a well-defined six pack that he was proud of. Eventually, Allen decided to trade in his jammers for a soccer ball. Peter kept whittling away slowly and patiently at his times in competition and, after advancing to the 13-14 division, he adopted the 100 fly as

butterfly. Modern rules dictate the specifics of format, but the essential structure of each race is the same: a start, a swim, and a finish. The AquATiC environmenT Swimming differs from other sports in several ways. For one thing, swimming is not necessarily a natural activity for human beings. Indeed, humans bear little resem- blance to species that are geared to operate in an aquatic environment; for example, fish don’t have necks. As a result, in order to swim, we humans must make some adaptations—in part to accommodate our differences but also to take advantage of them. For success in swimming, you must first become comfortable in the aquatic envi- ronment, which differs dramatically from the land-based environment in which we typically operate on a daily basis. It is easier to do so if you understand the key dif- ferences between humans and aquatic creatures. First, as mostly terrestrial creatures, we walk upright, and our natural position for most of our waking hours is basically vertical. In the water, however, most of what we do involves being horizontal, and this difference takes some getting used to for most people. In addition, in many sports, success depends largely on strength and speed. In swimming, however, there is nothing solid to push against; therefore, though strength does matter in swimming, it is much more important to apply pressure to the water in the correct way. Because water is a fluid, it moves around you rather xi --- Page 13 Text --- The Sport of Swimming than resolutely resisting you in the way that a solid does. Similarly, speed in swim- ming comes not necessarily from moving your body parts faster but from using your movements to put pressure on the water in an effective manner. As anyone who has participated in water

DolPhin KicK The next propulsive motion to learn is that of the dolphin, or butterfly, kick. Though somewhat similar to the flutter kick, this technique for manipulating the water is a little more difficult to master. Instead of alternating the legs, this kick keeps the legs together as if they were bonded, thus mimicking closely the motion of a dolphin’s tale. The advantage of this kick is that it applies more surface area to the water to produce more propulsive force. Dolphin Kicking at the Wall Unlike the flutter kick, this kick (figure 2.7) derives its power from the middle part of the core—from the lower part of the rib cage down through the pelvis. Let the strong muscles of your core initiate most of the work. Your legs should stay together the entire time, and, as with the flutter kick, they

The next part is to make sure that the kick you are developing is propulsive. You should be in the same extended streamlined position that you developed in step 1. If your hands are grabbing the wall and hanging on instead of being pushed toward it, do a simple hands-to-toes check for proper positioning. 38 --- Page 58 Text --- Manipulating the Water Dolphin Kicking Away From the Wall Once you have gone through these helpful cues and can feel the pressure you are applying to the water, it is time for the real test of propulsive force, butterfly kicking away from the wall (figure 2.8).

It is best to do it in a streamlined position if you can. The purpose of this drill is to help you develop the ability to put pressure on the water in an up-and-down fashion. To increase DiFFiculTy • Kick underwater in a streamlined position. Propulsive force can be gen- erated with an asymmetrical kick; however, maximum propulsion comes from kicking in both directions. This capability comes into play in both the butterfly and the backstroke. To Decrease DiFFiculTy • Use fins to prevent that stalling feeling and avoid rushing the drill. • Rest your upper arms across the kickboard by gripping the top to keep your face out of the water. Be aware that doing so may put extra stress on your lower back. • Use a swimmer’s snorkel.

a study in keeping that balanced developed in the first few steps. You know from earlier steps that head position is important. The following drills will help you establish a good head position and help with breathing. Breathing Drill Tennis Ball 2 This drill helps you maintain proper head position while going to get air or breathing in breaststroke. To perform the drill, place a tennis ball beneath your chin and hold it to your chest. This action keeps your neck in line and prevents you from coming up too high when you breathe. Swim the regular breaststroke and try breathing both earlier in the stroke and later in the stroke to find out which works best for you. Avoid pushing down on the water with your palms. To increase DifficulTy • Leave your face in the water for one or two stroke cycles. To Decrease DifficulTy • Put on fins and use a dolphin kick rather than a breaststroke kick.

laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes: • Good body position • Effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Acceleration throughout the stroke • Kicking rhythm • Effective breathing • Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective butterfly. The basic motion of the butterfly involves an undulating rhythm in which the legs and arms are synchronized by precise timing. The most important element of a good butterfly stroke is the use of the body’s core, which is the greatest source of power. Here are the basic movements as you flow through the stroke. From the neutral position described in step 1—facedown in the water with your arms stretched out above your head—press your chest down toward the pool bottom. To help you do so, you can use a downward motion of your feet with your legs together in a dol- phin-kick downstroke. Next, push your hips down while arching your back to bring your head and chest back toward the surface. Again, you are encouraged to use your legs in a dol- phin-kick upstroke; you should feel some pressure on the backs of your legs and the bottoms of your feet. You use the dolphin kick here both to provide propulsive force and to manipulate the position of your center of buoyancy to produce an undulating motion. 115 --- Page 135 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success As you complete the undulating and kicking motion, pitch your fingers down toward the bottom of the pool and bend at the elbows in a motion similar to that of pushing yourself up out of

cage down through your pelvis. In addi- tion, your legs stay together the whole time. The basic motion involves driving your hips back and forth with the strong muscles of your core and using your legs merely to finish off the kick. Your legs should be long and loose; let your strong core muscles initiate most of the work. A good mental image for this kick is the motion of a dolphin or whale. Try to mimic that motion with your body, from your chest on down. Some swimmers also find it helpful to imagine that their legs are glued together and cannot be separated. In this step, you will work on the following skills: 1. Developing a propulsive and symmetrical kick 2. Laying your hands on the water and achieving a good catch position 3. Getting from the catch to the pull and making sure that the force is applied in the correct direction 4. Accelerating your hands through the pull 5. Synchronizing the kick and the pull 6. Effective breathing 7. Recovery of the arms Dolphin Kick With Face Out of Water The key here is to sustain a steady rhythmic kick (don’t think about speed just yet) that feels like you are putting pressure on the water all the way down your leg. Remember to start the kick with your core and move fluidly down through your legs. Once you have mastered this motion (figure 6.1), it is time to move on to the next part of the progression. 116 --- Page 136 Text --- Butterfly Figure 6.1 Dolphin KicK WiTh Face ouT oF WaTer Preparation 1.

If you come to a stop or even go backward, repeat the hands-to-toes check for correct positioning. Many swimmers come to the pool with a limited range of motion in their ankles. Make sure that your ankles are slightly plantar-flexed so that your toes point away from your body, but not so much as to make your legs rigid. When you need to breathe, simply apply pressure to the kickboard and lift your head for air. Make this motion quick in order to maintain your balance in the water and get your face back in the water to stabilize your balance. Figure 6.3 Dolphin KicK WiTh KicKBoarD Preparation 1.

Your Back Dolphin kicking on the back (figure 6.5) differs only slightly from kicking on the front. The upstroke of the kick is propulsive, whereas the downstroke is used to propel the arms in the recovery and entry. Once again, it is helpful to develop an effective mental image. As with kicking on your front, imagine the joints of each leg being connected by a rubber band; staying long and loose is still a key. This mental image helps you apply pressure in the right places and recruit the proper muscles. 120 --- Page 140 Text --- Butterfly Figure 6.5 Dolphin KicK on Your BacK Preparation 1.

Many swimmers start off stiff and mechanical in their kicking rhythm; with practice, however, they develop a smoother and much more propulsive kick. Here are a few drills to help you master this skill. Dolphin Kicking Drill 1 Vertical Kicking After you have achieved propulsion in dolphin kicking, work on kicking both up and down. This drill helps you develop a symmetrical kick. Find water deep enough to be over your head, then begin by treading water with your head out and using a flutter kick. Once you are comfortable, switch to a dolphin kick. The goal here is to remain stationary in the water without making much use of your hands. If you kick more forcefully in one direction, you will drift around in the pool. Staying in place, on the other hand, means that you are putting pressure on the water with both the fronts and the backs of your legs. You should feel the pres- sure most on the tops and bottoms of your feet, since they are the body parts that finish off the kick. To increase DiFFiculTY • Do not use your hands at all for balance. • Put your hands on top of your head. • Raise your hands straight above you in a streamlined position.

Dolphin Kicking Drill 2 Kick on Your Back This drill helps you continue to develop a symmetrical kick. Now that you feel the pressure on the water, it is time to ensure that it is propulsive pressure by moving through the water. The next part of the progression for an effective dolphin kick is to lie on your back in the neutral position described in step 1 with your hands at your sides for balance. Begin dolphin-kicking with special emphasis on the pressure on the bottoms of your feet. As with the backstroke flutter kick, keep your knees underwater; do not just “push” at the water with the tops of your feet. Some swimmers find it beneficial to think of curling the toes in order to feel the feet in a stretched-out position while keeping the ankles loose. Important note! You will not be able to see where you are going during this drill. Make sure that the backstroke flags are in place—5 yards from the wall—or have your coach or instructor stop you when necessary!

BuTTerFlY arMsTroKe Since its inception, the butterfly armstroke (figure 6.6) has been taught in many ways. In the early years, many instructors advocated an outsweep of the hands and a movement in a keyhole fashion. Later variants included an insweep, as well making almost a figure-eight pattern. The modern butterfly uses more of a straight pull with the maximum amount of arm area perpendicular to the direction in which you are going. 124 --- Page 144 Text --- Butterfly Figure 6.6 BuTTerFlY arMsTroKe Preparation 1.

Separate each motion into a distinct movement as you pitch your fingers down, rotate your elbows up, and push through to finish with your hands past your hips. Accelerate your hands through the entire movement. 126 --- Page 146 Text --- Butterfly Once you have completed the movement, your hands are at your thighs and you are moving forward.

Now, sneak your hands back up along your body, keeping your elbows in until you are at the first position, then repeat. This is very similar to the breaststroke pullout. To increase DiFFiculTY • Once you are comfortable with this drill, add one dolphin kick prior to moving your hands back and another after finishing the pull at your thighs.

BuTTerFlY arM recoVerY Many swimmers struggle with arm recovery (figure 6.7) if they perform the pull incorrectly. It is easy for the arms to recover over the water if the hands accelerate through the stroke and finish at or slightly wider than the hips. The reason is that the momentum of the stroke carries the hands through the exit, which means that less effort is required to bring the arms and hands back to the forward position. The key is to finish the stroke fast and feather the hands so that they exit the water smoothly, pinkies out first. If the stroke is finished with an acceleration, the forward movement of the arms requires

BreaThing The timing of the breath is critical to a good butterfly stroke. As with the breast- stroke, breathing at the wrong time during the butterfly stroke cycle not only slows the stroke but also increases the rate of fatigue. However, whereas mistimed breath- ing in the breaststroke mainly makes you slow, mistimed breathing in the butterfly exhausts you and forces you to stop. 130 --- Page 150 Text --- Butterfly To learn when to breathe and how to do so with proper technique, you use a few simple mental cues and drills (figure 6.8). The first cue addresses how high to rise out of the water when getting air. Rising too high reduces momentum and undulation. As a corrective, think of pushing your chin forward rather than lifting your head. The next concern is the timing of your breathing. Many swimmers breathe late. To avoid this pitfall, initiate the forward chin movement as you start your pull and make it a quick breath. How often you breathe depends on your individual needs and development as a swimmer. Conventional wisdom used to recommend breath- ing on every other stroke and leaving your face in the water rather than getting air on each stroke. However, after several Olympians chose to breathe either on every stroke or in a one-two pattern, it became apparent that butterfly swimmers should breathe as often as they need to—but not more.

Figure 6.8 BuTTerFlY BreaThing Preparation 1. Review the preceding skill discussions of arm stroking, recovery, and positioning. 2. Start at the end of the pool and make sure that you have plenty of room to perform the skill. Execution 1. As you begin to pull back— a with your fingers down and your elbows up, as described in previous skills—push your chin slightly forward. 2. The change of position and the flow of water against your chest allow your mouth and nose to be right at the sur- face of the water in order to get air. 3. Exhale while your face is in the water so that you can get quick air while your face is out. 4. Make sure that your face b returns to the water as your hands exit on the recovery. 131 --- Page 151 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success MissTep Many swimmers lift the head and then drop it back down, almost as if nodding or bobbing for apples. The problem here is that when the head goes up, the hips sink. correcTion Remember not to lift your head but instead to push your chin for- ward.

TiMing anD rhYThM Timing is crucial in both the breaststroke and the butterfly, but especially in the but- terfly; if your timing is off, you go slow and wear out fast.

152 Text --- Butterfly From the neutral position, push your chest down and your hips up while kicking down, then push your hips down and your chest up while kicking up. Position your fingers down and your elbows up while pushing your chin forward. Pull through and accelerate your hands while coming up for air. Flip your hands and arms out, down past your hips, and around in a sweeping motion while also placing your face back in the water and kicking down again. Drills For TiMing anD rhYThM Here are a few simple drills that you can do to emphasize timing. Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 1 1-2-3-4-5 Butterfly This drill separates the propulsive movements. Perform each distinct movement described in the summary of butterfly rhythm, waiting one or two seconds between movements. As you get more comfortable with the movements and with the timing, reduce the wait interval until you are swimming the full-stroke butterfly. Breathe on every stroke if necessary and less often if possible. To do the drill, lie facedown on the water in the neutral position with your hands in front. Then implement the five elements referred to in the numbers of the drill name (1-2-3-4-5 Butterfly): (1) push your chest down, (2) push your hips down and your chest up, (3) pitch your fingers down, (4) pull through, and (5) recover. The idea here is to slow the movements into separate and distinct actions. You can speed up as you become more comfortable with the rhythm. To increase DiFFiculTY • Speed up the rhythm.

In competition, an effective turn saves race time when changing direction. For recreational and fitness swimmers, an effective turn maximizes your workout time and enhances your proficiency in the water. Every turn, regardless of the type, consists of four key elements: 1. Approach

that provides competitive swimmers with a target. Since both the breaststroke 147 --- Page 167 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success and the butterfly are forward-looking strokes, you can also easily sneak a peek at your distance from the wall. Many pools also have a spillover gutter system or a low coping that allows you to grasp the wall with your hands. This technique reduces your length and thus the resistance during your turn and causes your feet to come up close to the wall for the exchange. Figure 7.5 TwO-hanD TOuch Turn: apprOach Preparation 1. As you approach the wall, take a final stroke and reach for the wall with both hands. 2. Stretch for the wall rather than taking an additional short stroke. a Execution 1. As your momentum carries you into the wall, grasp it (or push away from it with your hands). 2. Drive your knees up toward your chest. 3. Rotate your feet toward the wall. b MissTep You come to a stop before reaching the wall, or you end up with your face very close to the wall or hit the wall with your arm. cOrrecTiOn Take one more stroke, or one fewer, to adjust your distance. MissTep You have to take a half-stroke because you are too close. cOrrecTiOn It is better to be long on the turn than short. In breaststroke competi- tion, the drag is increased and slows you down, and the pull must also be followed by a kick, according to current rules. This could lead to a disqualification, so it is preferable to glide to the wall. 148 --- Page 168 Text --- Turns During the exchange (figure 7.6), your body rotates and you draw one arm back toward the other end of the pool and then extend your

addition, since you are on your side, you need to rotate to the correct position during the streamline. Also as before, your head position controls your depth on the streamline. 149 --- Page 169 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 7.7 TwO-hanD TOuch Turn: push-Off anD sTreaMLine Preparation Execution 1. Complete the previous two skills. 1. Make sure that your hands touch 2. Position yourself on your side in each other; your body sinks to a near-streamlined position with the level of your feet. your feet on the wall. 2. The push is critical for getting a good streamline. So push off forcefully. 3. Rotate to the correct position during the streamline. 4. As soon as you push off, begin kicking rhythmically; do not wait to slow down. MissTep You rotate on the wall and are facedown. cOrrecTiOn Draw your knees up while twisting only slightly so that you are on your side when you are ready to push. The last part of the turn is the breakout (figure 7.8), in which you transition from the streamlined position to a swimming position. For the butterfly and breaststroke, the first movement is the kick, so you will need to be near the surface. To get there, simply push your chin forward. Please note that you should not necessarily lift your head; instead, bring your chin forward, which causes you to rise to the surface grad- ually. As in all of these breakouts, make sure to be neither too shallow nor too deep. 150 --- Page 170 Text --- Turns Figure 7.8 TwO-hanD TOuch Turn: BreakOuT Preparation 1. Push off in a streamline.

from a beach or other shore with a shallow and long run out to deeper water. To do the drill, get clear knowledge of the bottom terrain, then wade into ankle-deep water. Continue wading out until the water is at least waist deep, then lean in, almost as if doing the butterfly stroke; be sure that your hands are in front of you before you push off of the bottom. Come up, stand, and repeat as necessary until you are in water of good swimming depth. To do this drill in a pool, find a zero-entry pool or practice by diving over a lane line or noodle in shallow water. If you are in a zero-entry pool, be sure that it has sufficient depth for performing the drill safely. Keep your hands in front of your head when dolphining into the water so that any change in depth is felt by your hands— not your head. You can also dive under a lane line or noodle as if it were a wave coming in to the shore; swimming over such waves is a waste of energy, so it is better to simply duck under them. tO inCreaSe diFFiCulty • Push with one foot while maintaining forward movement with your other leg, as if you were striding on land. tO deCreaSe diFFiCulty • Stop after each dolphin.
