the direction of swimming. It is also important to mimic swimming tempo as much as possible. A tempo slower than swimming tempo will not transfer to faster speed in the water. 21 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 21 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 24 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Finally, at the stage of a swimmer’s career when he is specializing in particular events, it is important to focus on strength work that will benefit the swimmer’s specialty. Strength work for these specialists should maximize the strong aspects of the swimmer’s event and build up the weak points. For instance, if a swimmer is specializing in the 200 fly and has awesome stroke efficiency, but tends to lose tempo on the last 50, the emphasis of strength work should be on training for force (the strong point) as well as building power (the weak point). However, a 50 freestyle specialist who is an awesome finisher but needs to improve reaction time off the blocks, should focus on training for power (the strong point) as well as building explosiveness (the weak point). ADAPTATION Strength training is based on the premise that when muscles are stressed, they adapt to that stress, thus becoming stronger. Because the process of stressing muscles actually creates tiny tears in the muscle fibers, they must be allowed to rest and rebuild before they can become stronger. For this reason, strength building must be considered a long-term activity, designed to build strength gradually over time, using periods of stress and rest. When adaptation is allowed to occur in this way, it is important that the program evolve, providing new challenges to swimmers as they adapt. Such challenges can take the form of doing the same exercise with more load, more repetitions, or faster repetitions depending on the objective. Or

used to. To illustrate this point, compare the actions 31 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 31 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 34 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming performed with the arms in rowing with those used in swimming. They have many similarities and use many of the same muscles. Rowing, in fact, is a land exercise often recommended for swimmers. Both rowers and swimmers initiate the arm movement with their arms extended in front of them. Both pull toward the body. Both use a cycling arm action. However, in rowing, the athlete’s body position is perpendicular to the arms. In swimming, the body is positioned parallel to the arms. This fundamental difference distinguishes the way the muscles exert themselves in swimming from the way they do in rowing and most other land activities. The foot position of swimmers is another good example of the unique way muscles are used in swimming. Without the ground as a foundation, the feet take on a completely different role in the water. The primary human foot position is perpendicular to the leg, creating a base to stand on and spring from. In swimming, this foot position is used only in a limited fashion for the breaststroke kick, and for starts and turns. Instead, the primary foot position for swimmers is pointed, heel to toe. From this position, it is the top of the foot that applies the most resistance rather than the sole of the feet. This seemingly minor difference is central to how the muscles in the entire leg are used. In fact, it is common for people who are not used to swimming to experience cramps in the calf and in the arch of the foot when they swim due to the different requirements of the muscles when resistance is applied with the

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
four separate actions, rather than one connected action. Linking the muscles together in coordinated movement allows the swimmer to produce better forward motion with less effort. For this reason, strength training for swimmers should involve multiple muscle groups, to simulate swimming motion as much as possible, rather than training muscles in isolation. MOVING AND STABILIzING 34 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 34 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 37 Text --- The Swimming Muscles Muscles throughout the body are involved in creating forward movement for the swimmer. Each of these muscles is dedicated to produce specific motions that contribute to the swimming motion as a whole. While muscles create movement for the swimmer, they also have another important function. Muscles also perform as stabilizers. Like in other sports, muscles provide stability to the body in motion and the joints. The muscles that stabilize the knee, for example, keep the bones of the upper and lower leg aligned. Imagine what would happen if there were no stabilizers at the knee; walking, standing, and kicking would be impossible. Unique to swimming is the additional role of the muscles in providing stability to the moving body as it floats. Without the ground to stand on, swimmers must create their own foundation of stability. In order to move forward in swimming, muscles in one area of the body must be engaged in balancing the effect of an action in another part of the body. These stabilizing muscles maintain tension against the resistance that is being applied. Without good tension, the effect that is produced is not forward motion as desired but a fishtailing or bobbing movement. Muscles are often categorized as movers and stabilizers. While some muscles serve exclusively as stabilizers, many muscles actually perform both functions. It is the larger surface layer muscles of the core and

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
powerful downbeat of the kick. However, during the upbeat, they serve as knee stabilizers, keeping it from hyper-extending. Strength training should address both moving and stabilizing. Because the stabilizing effect is more subtle, often strength-building efforts focus on the moving function and ignore the stabilizing function. The importance of self- stabilization in swimming cannot be emphasized enough. We must understand that moving and stabilizing work in partnership. Efficient movement in the water cannot work without both. Therefore strength for moving and strength for stabilizing must be developed in a balanced manner. 37 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 37 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 40 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming WHAT CONNECTS EVERYTHING The most obvious muscles used in swimming are in the arms and legs. A quick look at any swimmer in motion shows us that our four limbs are constantly moving. Although it might appear that the arms and legs are our primary movers, in fact, they account for just a small part of a swimmer’s propulsion. What connects the four limbs in integrated motion is the core of the body. Like a ceiling fan, with its blades turning, what joins the action of the blades, determines their speed, and generates their power is the motor in the middle. By generating swimming movements from the motor in the middle – the core –, a swimmer employs the largest muscles to initiate the action and then is able to transfer that motion up to the arms and down to the legs. The relatively smaller muscles of the limbs may ultimately apply the resistance, but the larger muscles of the core are able to produce more force and power, allowing a faster tempo to be created and sustained. The muscles of the core, both in the front and the back of the

It involves the growth and maturing of every body system. It happens in its own time. Although we may contribute to physical development through good nutrition and healthy living, and we may even exert some control on heightening performance through training, we cannot hurry the actual process of development. While some have tried to influence this process with growth hormones and other drugs, the rewards are very short-lived, and the consequences are great and enduring as the body rebels by becoming sick, injured or shutting down, unable to support artificially accelerated development. Gradual, natural development allows the systems of the body to physically support each other as they grow. The skeleton of a child cannot support the muscles of an adult, but as the child’s bones grow, larger muscles and more strength are possible. Gradual development also allows time for important connections to be established between the brain and the body. As we develop, our simple actions evolve into more complex actions over time. Initial, awkward movements become coordinated and seamless. While people develop at different rates, there is a predictable progression of development that occurs in stages over a lifetime. When designing a strength training program, the stage of development is an important consideration. Strength training encompasses a wide variety of activities, which meet a wide variety of objectives. For every stage, there are particular developmental milestones that should correspond to strength training objectives. As the stage of development changes, strength training objectives must change, too. The content of a

swimming. The motion is repeated with a controlled reverse action or recovery between each exertion. The swimmer can use a tempo equal to his or her swimming tempo against resistance or practice an “ideal” higher tempo. Stretch cords also promote core stabilization, as the swimmer must maintain constant tension in the body from the standing position, bent forward at the waist, while the arms are moving. Stretch cords are available in a variety of thicknesses, which determine their resistance. Because too much resistance will make proper technique impossible, it is important to start with a stretch band that has less resistance and work up to more resistance when good technique is maintained. The following stretch cord exercises are highly recommended: 82 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 82 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 85 Text --- Let’s Get Specific FULL BODY Double Arm Pull — Standing and bent forward at the waist, hold the stretch cord in both hands and perform the underwater path of butterfly, accelerating throughout. Recover gently following the same path. Repeat. Alternating Arm Pull — Standing and bent forward at the waist, hold the stretch cord with both hands and perform the underwater path of freestyle, accelerating toward the end with one arm while the other recovers gently following the reverse path. Repeat in an alternating manner. Double Triceps Press — Standing straight, hold the stretch cord with both hands, with the elbows at a right angle and firmly against the sides of the body. Straighten the arms quickly without moving elbows. Recover gently along the same path. Repeat.

Cable Pull — This machine has a bar attached to cables and pulleys that attach to an adjustable stack of weights. Many exercises can be performed on this machine, but two simulate swimming best. The first is done by standing facing the machine, holding the bar with the arms extended overhead, then doing a double arm freestyle underwater pull. The second is done lying on the back on a bench in front of the machine, holding the bar with the arms extended overhead, then a double arm freestyle underwater pull.

the swim leg in a pool. In some triathlons swimmers are banned from doing tumble turns – but it’s still possible to make up a lot of time by doing the fastest possible touch turn. Top tip The advice and drills in Swim Better, Swim Faster will make you a good freestyle swimmer. But improvement doesn’t stop there. BECOME YOUR OWN COACH This really works: after over 40 years of swimming, I still think about my technique on just about every length I swim, try new things, and develop new ways of training. Always be careful, though, about picking up bits and pieces of advice from the internet. There’s more than one style of swimming front crawl. The technique in this book is good for swimming middle and longer distances, but --- Page 8 Text --- may not be what a typical sprinter would use. Mixing and matching from different styles isn’t likely to help your stroke. OPEN WATER Open-water swimming – in lakes, rivers and the sea – is a fast-growing area of the sport. The back-to-nature vibe, and the fact that it’s generally free, fits the spirit of the times. But if you’re used to pools, swimming in open water requires adaptations to your approach. You also need one or two extra pieces of equipment. See Chapter 9 to find out more. RAPID IMPROVEMENTS Putting Swim Better, Swim Faster into action should lead to noticeable gains within a relatively short time. Swimmers often report a measureable improvement within three or four hours. Within 10 to 12 hours, most people find their stroke has become smoother and more efficient.

three or four hours. Within 10 to 12 hours, most people find their stroke has become smoother and more efficient. To help you get maximum benefit from the book, at the back you’ll find suggested suggested training sessions. Each session focuses on a different aspect of your front-crawl style, and is between 20 and 40 minutes long. If you have more time than this, it’s easy to combine the main sets from different sessions together. FOCUS YOUR TRAINING Always distinguish working on your technique from training for fitness. You learn new techniques best when fresh and rested. Never nail technique work onto the end of a fitness-based session: you’ll be too tired to do the work properly. USING THE BOOK Each of the technique sections of this book has the same structure: • First there’s an introduction to the subject and the key elements that will improve your stroke, saying what you’re trying to achieve. • There’s also information on some of the common problems swimmers experience, and suggestions for ways to check which areas you need to work on. --- Page 9 Text --- • Finally, there are drills that will help you to improve. If there’s more than one drill, the simplest and/or most basic comes first, then they get steadily more advanced. A poor kicking style, with very bent knees. This will hold the swimmer back by creating drag and affecting her body position. She needs to remember the coaching maxim ‘kick water not air’ This swimmer has a much neater swimming technique: most of the movement comes from her hips, not her knees, and she is kicking mostly underwater with only her heels breaking the surface. --- Page 10 Text --- SWIMMING IS SIMPLE swim verb float, glide, slip, stroke, submerge, move or propel yourself through

my body rolling from side to side like his/hers? BODY POSITION Your body should always be in a straight line pointing toward the end of the pool, like a pencil floating on the surface. One common way of expressing this is to imagine you’re a human kebab, with an unbendable metal stick running from head to heels. You may prefer to imagine your body is contained in a tube: you can rotate inside it, but you mustn’t touch the sides. KICKING Kicking for front crawl is the opposite of what Austrian ski instructors always used to shout: do not bend the knees. At least, not deliberately. Big knee-based kicks create so much turbulence and drag that they actually slow you down. They also wreak havoc with your body position, wagging your bottom about or causing your hips to drop. Instead aim to kick from your hips. Keep your knees stiff (but not rigid) and your ankles relaxed. Front crawl swimmers generally use one, two or three kicks per arm stroke. Two works well for most people, but it’s more important that your technique is good than that you match a particular number. --- Page 15 Text --- Front crawl kick is done in a smooth, continuous movement. Notice how the swimmer always has one leg almost straight, while the other is only ever slightly bent. This is because she is kicking from the hips, not the knees. The swimmer’s feet never break the surface: every up and down movement acts on the water, not the air. Big splashes may look fast, but in reality they usually slow you down. EQUIPMENT One of the nice things about swimming is that you don’t have to drag loads of equipment around with you. Two things that are essential, if you don’t own them

on the water, not the air. Big splashes may look fast, but in reality they usually slow you down. EQUIPMENT One of the nice things about swimming is that you don’t have to drag loads of equipment around with you. Two things that are essential, if you don’t own them already, are a proper costume and some goggles. • A fitted costume is important because anything that drags, such as loose shorts for men, will slow you down and give a false impression of how well (or rather, how badly) you’re swimming. • Goggles allow you to see what your hands are doing underwater and whether you’re swimming in a straight line. • Earplugs are also a good idea: otherwise, the noise and sensation of having --- Page 16 Text --- your ears fill with water, especially in drills where you’re swimming on your side, can be really annoying. Most of the drills in this book can be done without any additional kit, but there’s some equipment that comes in handy if you want to invest in it: • Swim fins – not diving fins. Swim fins are shorter and tend to be made of softer rubber. They should fit closely, but without being super-tight. • Kickboard (for holding onto while swimming legs-only) and pull buoy (to put between your thighs while doing arms-only). Pools usually have these available if you ask, but it’s better to bring your own. Kickboards provided by the pool are often too small, meaning you have to use two stacked up. • Swimming snorkel, which rises in front of your face and is handy in some drills and for practising kick. If you use one of these, you’ll also need a nose clip. --- Page 17 Text --- • Ankle band: this is a rubber

Keys to success • It’s OK to concentrate a bit more on specific areas, but make sure your flexibility training encompasses your whole body • Try to work flexibility exercises into your daily routine: always do them when a particular TV programme starts or finishes, or before breakfast, for example • Always include stretching in your swimming sessions, both at the start and the finish --- Page 44 Text --- BODY POSITION position noun place, arrangement, posture, location, situation, setting, the posture that somebody’s body is in, the way or direction in which an object is placed or arranged WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR The aim in swimming is always to find a more streamlined position. This allows you to glide along, rather than fighting your way down the pool. There are four key elements to a good streamlined style: 1. The right head angle 2. Correct chest and hip position 3. Good body roll --- Page 45 Text --- 4. Eliminating twist HEAD ANGLE The angle at which you hold your head has a big effect, because it’s linked to your upper body. This in turn affects your hips, which in turn affect your leg kick. Most swimmers hold their heads too high (partly as a result of the need to see where you’re going in a public pool). Aim to swim looking at the bottom of the pool, perhaps very slightly ahead but with your neck basically in line with your body. You can experiment with head position while swimming along: too low will immediately be obvious, you’ll be able to feel it slowing you down.

a rough guide to what stroke counts by an adult swimmer in a 25m pool might indicate: 25+ strokes per length: Taking this many strokes would generally mean there’s plenty of room for improvement in your technique and streamlining. 20–24 strokes per length: Although at the lower end of this scale your stroke is getting pretty efficient, there are likely still to be things you can do to improve your technique. 19 strokes or fewer: This is the sort of stroke count that will look lazy to other people, but can still move you pretty quickly down the pool. These are not rigid guidelines: some swimmers (even Olympic champions) have a high stroke count per length, while some poor swimmers have a low one. If you naturally swim with a high stroke count, don’t punish yourself trying to lower it to 15. It will still be worth counting strokes, though, as the logic applies: developing a more efficient stroke will lead to a lower count. BODY ROLL Freestyle is sometimes called front crawl – a misleading name, as you shouldn’t be spending very much time actually on your front. It should really be called --- Page 53 Text --- side crawl, because most of your time is spent with your body rolled to one side or the other. Be careful not to confuse body roll (good) with twist (so bad it should be sent to bed without any supper). Your body should keep a straight-line shape as much as possible, but your torso spins around the imaginary straight line running from your head to your feet. There are three big advantages to rolling your body with each stroke. First, you’re more streamlined and slip through the water using less energy. Second, the roll helps your leading hand extend further forward

Push off the wall, and float on the surface in a streamlined position. Kick your legs in a flutter kick or use a pull buoy: the function of this is to keep your body position flat in the water, rather than to drive you forward. Have your arms relaxed and stretched out in front of you. 2. Keeping your arms straight, scull them out and in together (i.e. both arms at the same time). Have your hands angled a little downward, and scoop them around so that they’re facing slightly out as you scull out, and slightly inward as you scull in. 3.

in together (i.e. both arms at the same time). Have your hands angled a little downward, and scoop them around so that they’re facing slightly out as you scull out, and slightly inward as you scull in. 3. Keep this motion going in a continuous rhythm, sculling your way down the lane. Experiment with different angles for your hands, to see how it affects the amount of lift and drive. Always, though, keep your arms straight and extended out in front. --- Page 70 Text --- Bent-arms scull This is a development of the straight-arms scull, and starts to introduce the high-elbow position. --- Page 71 Text --- What you need • A fairly empty pool, as you’ll be moving slowly • A swimming snorkel if you have one, so that you don’t have to breathe 1. Push off the wall with your arms extended, as at the start of the previous drill. Kick enough to keep yourself flat in the water. 2. Instead of keeping your arms straight, bend them at the elbow. The key to this drill is that you must keep your elbows high, only just below the surface of the water. 3. Allow your hands to scull in and out, swinging below your elbows like a pair of upside-down windscreen wipers. Again, experiment with hand angles to find the greatest degree of lift and propulsion. When you can no longer see your hands in the clear part of your goggles, it’s time to bring them back in again. --- Page 72 Text --- THE CATCH: HIGH-ELBOW INITIATION --- Page 73 Text --- Once you’ve done them a few times, the straight-arms and bent-arms scull drills will give you a good feel for swimming with your arms further away from your body than most people are used

something you can work on. 1. Swim freestyle exactly as normal, but with your hands closed into fists. Vary how you do this: one hand as a fist, both, three strokes with closed fists, two open, etc. 2. Notice the difference in sensation between a closed fist pushing (pretty ineffectively) against the water and your open hand. 3. Also pay attention to the feeling in your forearm when you have a closed fist. You’ll notice that you can feel the pressure of water against it. This shows how it’s not only your hand that provides propulsion – it’s also your forearm. --- Page 80 Text --- Top tip POINT YOUR FINGERTIPS DOWN! Your pull is most powerful when your fingertips are pointing straight down, and your hand is at 90° to the bottom of the pool. Get your hand into this position as soon as possible, and stay in it for as long as possible. --- Page 81 Text --- This swimmer has started to angle her hand down even before it has entered the water EXIT AND RECOVERY The exit and recovery stage should be done as smoothly as possible. It is led by the elbow, not the hand: the elbow lifts out of the water, and the forearm swings forward below it, like a broken windscreen wiper. Keep your arms relaxed and let your hand swing through quite close to the surface of the water. The three most common mistakes people make with the recovery phase are: • Leading the recovery with their hand, rather than the elbow • Throwing their arm violently forward, and often out to the side as well • Lifting their arm high in the air --- Page 82 Text --- A relaxed-arm, elbow-led recovery Fingertip drag and zipper drills These drills will help

This isn’t all that surprising. We tend to think that it’s just using the same muscles as we use for walking around. In fact, a freestyle leg kick requires a very specific technique, strength and fitness. Get this right, and many of the other pieces of your stroke quickly fall into place. WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR The leg kick for freestyle is called a flutter kick. You kick from the hips (never the knees, though the knees do bend), causing your feet to flutter on relaxed --- Page 106 Text --- ankles at the end of fairly straight legs. You give a strong kick at the end of your arm recovery, on the opposite side. (This happens automatically and is not something you need to do consiously.) A good leg kick is a bit like the egg in a cake mix: leave it out, and the rest of the ingredients won’t stick together. The key functions of freestyle leg kick are: • Aiding a good, flat body position in the water • Balancing your arm stroke • Adding propulsion, or forward drive, to your stroke – the kick’s least important job, as it provides less than a tenth of your propulsion The flutter kick isn’t a big, splashy kick. One of the most common

good, flat body position in the water • Balancing your arm stroke • Adding propulsion, or forward drive, to your stroke – the kick’s least important job, as it provides less than a tenth of your propulsion The flutter kick isn’t a big, splashy kick. One of the most common mistakes people make is to do a large, deliberate kick from the knee, bending it almost as if they’re kicking a football. Kicking like this causes drag, affects your body position and upsets your arm technique. It’s like pulling a sea anchor along behind you. KICKING RHYTHM In freestyle, kicking rhythm is counted over a cycle of two arm strokes (one stroke by each arm). This means kicking once every arm stroke gives you a two- beat kick, twice equals a four-beat kick and three times gives a six-beat kick. Each rhythm has advantages, depending on the kind of swimming you do and your ability level. Six-beat kick This rhythm provides a good level of propulsion and balances the rest of the stroke extremely well. It can, though, be very tiring at first, which makes it most suited to competitive swimmers with a good, efficient technique. Four-beat kick This is a good basic rhythm. It provides a combination of balancing your stroke, conserving energy and providing a bit of forward power. Two-beat kick This provides little or no propulsion, but uses very little energy. The two-beat kick is used mainly by distance swimmers, who place a premium on endurance. --- Page 107 Text --- The turbulence of a two-beat kick The turbulence of a four-beat kick The turbulence of a six-beat kick KICK TRAINING PRINCIPLES There are a few principles that are worth sticking to when doing technique training for the flutter kick. 1 Try not to swim head-up Even

Page 107 Text --- The turbulence of a two-beat kick The turbulence of a four-beat kick The turbulence of a six-beat kick KICK TRAINING PRINCIPLES There are a few principles that are worth sticking to when doing technique training for the flutter kick. 1 Try not to swim head-up Even in most swimming clubs you’ll see swimmers doing freestyle kick training with their arms resting on a float and their head sticking up in the air. You don’t swim freestyle with your head up in the air – if possible, don’t train your body to kick in this unnatural position. Of course, swimming with your face in the water does make breathing tricky. The best way round the problem is to use a special swimming snorkel, which instead of going to the side of your head rises in front of your nose and forehead. --- Page 108 Text --- With a swimming snorkel you can concentrate on keeping a nice, flat body position, rather than lifting your head to breathe every few seconds. Using a swimming snorkel in public does require a certain degree of self-confidence, as it makes you look like an extra from a sci-fi movie. There are significant benefits though. 2 Use fins sparingly Swim fins are a good training aid: they are useful in supporting your body during arm drills, and in fitness work they load your legs and build strength. Unfortunately, fins are also the crack cocaine of the swimming world: highly addictive. Nothing beats the feeling of bombing down the pool like a turbocharged human/seal hybrid. Watch out you don’t get hooked. Overusing fins gives your body a false idea of what can be expected from your legs. Then, once you take them off, your technique falls apart. --- Page 109 Text --- Fins

Then, once you take them off, your technique falls apart. --- Page 109 Text --- Fins are a useful training aid – just don’t overuse them or your stroke will start to feel strange when you take them off. Top tip KICK WATER — NOT AIR! It can be tempting to make a big splash with your kick: it feels like you must be generating lots of speed. But you’re swimming in water, not air. Any time your feet come out of the water, they’re waving at the spectators rather than driving you forward. --- Page 110 Text --- Kicking: setting the flutter kick Doing this drill several times allows you to set the muscle memory for how a flutter kick should feel. It’s also useful if you feel your kick has gone off-track in some way: just haul out on the side of the pool and run through the exercise. What you need • A clear poolside with a raised edge (this drill is harder in pools where the deck is the same height as the water surface) 1. Sit on the edge of the pool, with your bottom on the deck and your thighs clear of it. Lean back and rest your weight on your hands, then extend your legs out straight over the water. --- Page 111 Text --- 2. Point your toes, and keep your legs close together.

water. --- Page 111 Text --- 2. Point your toes, and keep your legs close together. Lower your feet until they’re about 30 cm underwater. Make sure your toes are still pointed. 3. Keeping your legs straight, lift one foot steadily up, but don’t let it break the surface. Lower it again, raising the other foot in an opposite movement. Your feet should be close together as they pass. 4. Steadily increase the speed of the movement, relaxing your ankles so that they flutter up and down as you kick. As you get faster, aim to make the water boil without making any splash at all. Flutter kick practice One of the problems coaches often see is swimmers who use a big leg kick. This causes all kinds of problems, including increased drag and poor body position. Fortunately, practising a proper flutter kick usually brings quick results. This drill is not about getting to the end of the pool as fast as possible. It’s about practising the range of movement. What you need • Kickboard • Possibly a swimming snorkel 1. Hold the kickboard by its side, as shown in the photo, with just your thumbs over the top and your fingers underneath. You’re aiming to swim with relaxed wrists and bent elbows dangling down, rather than holding the --- Page 112 Text --- kickboard out in front of you with straight arms. 2. Push off and start kicking. Look down at the bottom of the pool. Use the limited range of movement from the previous drill, opposite: keep your legs straight, your toes pointed, and kick from the hips. Your knees should be stiff, but not rigid. 3. You’ll feel a rocking movement in your hips; try to keep your head still and your upper body still and relaxed.

range of movement from the previous drill, opposite: keep your legs straight, your toes pointed, and kick from the hips. Your knees should be stiff, but not rigid. 3. You’ll feel a rocking movement in your hips; try to keep your head still and your upper body still and relaxed. Breathe out steadily as soon as your face is underwater, which will help you to relax. 4. If you’re not using a swimming snorkel, lift your head to breathe when necessary, but keep kicking. Notice how lifting your head affects the angle of your hips and legs, and forces you to start bending your knees as you kick. If you feel your leg kick getting clunky and big during a swim, a few lengths of this drill will remind your body of what it should be doing. --- Page 113 Text --- Kicking: building power Many swimmers fail to get what they need from their leg kick because they only kick down, with the top of their foot and their shin. This drill encourages you to develop the other stroke of your leg kick: the upstroke, using the bottom of your foot and your calf. What you need • A small area of pool where you’re out of your depth There are three versions of this drill, each one increasingly difficult. When you can manage the third, hardest version it will be a good sign that your kick is really effective. Version 1 – least tough Float vertically in water that’s well out of your depth. Cross your arms over your chest, palms flat. Kick hard to keep your head above water, using the flutter kick described at the start of this chapter.

that’s well out of your depth. Cross your arms over your chest, palms flat. Kick hard to keep your head above water, using the flutter kick described at the start of this chapter. Take care not to start using an eggbeater kick, a kind of alternate breaststroke kick used by water polo players to lift their torsos out of the water. Ideally, try to maintain the exercise for at least 30 seconds before stopping for a 15-second rest, then repeating it. Doing this a total of five or six times each session should be enough. --- Page 114 Text --- Version 1 – least tough. Version 2 – harder In this version of the drill, instead of crossing your arms over your chest you lift your hands free of the water. Just keep your hands and forearms in the air, with your elbows below the surface. Version 2 – harder. --- Page 115 Text --- Version 3 – very testing This time, instead of putting only your hands in the air, lift up both arms into the streamlined position. You’ll have to kick very hard even to get your head above water for a breath. Only try this version when you’re comfortably able to complete five or six repetitions of the second iteration of this drill. Otherwise you risk swallowing a magnum of pool water and putting yourself off swimming forever. Version 3 – very testing. Kicking: building strength (part 1) This is a land-based training technique you can do anywhere. It builds leg strength, improves technique and strengthens your core. What you need: • A comfortable place to lie down • Ideally a fellow swimmer --- Page 116 Text --- 1. Lie on your back, with your hands tucked under your bottom, lifting your hips slightly. 2.

I call this the Tarzan-and-Jane drill, because I started doing it when I was a kid, after seeing Jonny Weissmuller and Maureen O’Sullivan, as Tarzan and Jane, swimming like this in a jungle pool. --- Page 127 Text --- What you need • Swimming pool with line along the bottom 1. Push off along the line, and take one stroke of front crawl. Reach ahead with your arm and let your body start to roll to the side as usual. 2. Instead of stopping the roll, let your body turn right over on to your back, with your leading arm still extended. Then take a stroke of backstroke with the other arm. 3. Continue the rolling motion in the same direction back on to your front, taking another stroke of front crawl. 4. Restart the sequence of the same three strokes – front–back–front – by taking another stroke on your front with the opposite arm. All the way down the length, aim to keep swimming above the line on the bottom of the pool. It seems impossible at first, but it does get easier! Fitness-training version You can also use a version of this drill as part of your fitness training. Instead of just one stroke each, front–back–front, do two strokes on your front, then three on your back. Keep this rhythm all the way down the length, do a length of straight freestyle to recover, then repeat. Sets of 100m or 200m at a time, with a 15-or 20-second rest between each, are an aerobic challenge for any swimmer. --- Page 129 Text --- SWIM MINDFULLY Even for good swimmers, it’s easy to forget technique when you’re training for fitness, or aiming at a timed event such as

Doing this will almost always cost you in the end. You can have the highest possible degree of fitness, but if your technique causes drag, that fitness won’t do you much good. Even in the midst of training hard, put aside time for technique. You’ll get more from this if you can fit in separate technique-work sessions, but few of us have unlimited time. If you’re going through a period when all your pool time is needed for fitness swimming, fitting the next exercises into the start of a training session can be a useful sharpener for your stroke. One-arm swimming This drill is good for establishing arm rhythm and breath timing, as well as overall technique. At first you may find it easier with swim fins and/or a pull buoy, though these are really a bit of a crutch – as your leg kick improves, try to set them aside. --- Page 130 Text --- What you need: • Possibly swim fins and a pull buoy (worn together these help you keep a nice, flat body position: the buoyancy of the fins keeps your feet up even if you don’t kick) 1. Push off into a streamlined position. Start your stroke as usual, but keep one arm reaching out in front of you the whole time. Take arm strokes only with the other arm. 2.

position. Start your stroke as usual, but keep one arm reaching out in front of you the whole time. Take arm strokes only with the other arm. 2. Focus on making sure you have good body roll, and breathe on your pulling-arm side. Breathe as infrequently as possible, but don’t let the drill become an aerobic challenge: you need to be swimming within yourself, rather than gasping for air. You can swim a whole length using just one arm, or take a certain number of breaths before changing sides. I prefer to change sides every four to six strokes, as it feels more balanced, but experiment to find the pattern that works best for you. --- Page 131 Text --- This is a tough drill, and under stress this swimmer has lifted his head, compromising his streamlined position in the water. He is, though, showing a very nice high-elbow pull. Trailing-arm variation This harder variation of the one-arm drill works your technique in a different way. In this version you leave your non-pulling arm trailing at your side, rather than reaching out in front of you, and breathe on the non-pulling side. The focus is on what your pulling-arm side is doing as you roll away from it to take a breath, and on timing the breath. It’s easy to start waggling your --- OCR from Page 131 Image 2 --- - rr aa | --- Page 132 Text --- body, so stay aware of the need to keep a long, flat, streamlined position.

long, flat, streamlined position. Butterfly drill I include this drill in almost every warm-up. It combines a freestyle arm stroke with a butterfly leg movement. The drill loosens up your torso, gives a really strong feeling for swimming on your side, and a feel for the rotation of your hips and kicking action as you breathe. 1. Push off the wall and take an arm stroke. Keep your other arm extended, and breathe on this first stroke, as you would coming to the surface after a turn. 2. After the recovery, stay rolled to the side and take a second arm stroke with the same arm. Use the forward movement of your arm as it enters the water and the turn of your head after the breath to create a butterfly motion of your body. Let this motion wave down your body, ending in a kick. 3. After two arm strokes on one side, repeat the pattern on the other side, pulling with the other arm, rolling your body in that direction and breathing on a new side. --- Page 133 Text --- SWIMMING BLIND You do need an empty lane to try this! But it’s a really good way to judge how straight and balanced your stroke is. Most of us are constantly making teeny little body adjustments to keep swimming in a straight line. These are based on visual inputs that you don’t consciously register. Take them away, and a truer idea of how balanced your technique is will emerge. I also find swimming blind is a useful way of concentrating on how your stroke feels. It’s amazing how much easier it is to sense the effectiveness of your arm pull, or the degree of water resistance you’re experiencing, with your eyes shut. Start by swimming along above

### SWIM BETTER SWIM FASTER_full_text.txt
The movement is similar to the previous drill, but this time it’s your arm that drives it, rather than your head: begin an arm pull, but continue the motion underneath your body, as if reaching back toward the space between your knees. 3. Let your head follow, and then the rest of your body as in the previous drill. --- Page 141 Text --- As before, keep blowing a constant stream of bubbles from your nose: only stop and take a breath when your head comes to the surface. 4. Practise this drill with both right and left arm stretching forward: later on this will mean you can turn whether it’s your right or left arm that makes the last stroke of the length. Leading with your arm This drill simply adds together two skills you already have: swimming freestyle and tumbling. It also teaches you how the angle at which you drive the turn with your arm affects the angle at which you tumble. 1. Push off the side of the wall into the streamlined position, then start swimming. Take a breath as you come up to the surface, then two or three strokes. 2. As you finish an arm stroke, perform the tumble you learned in the previous drill. Practise this on each arm, left and right. 3. Now try varying the angle at which your hand initiates the tumble. Instead of reaching between your knees, see what happens if you reach outside your left knee or right knee. Note how this affects the angle at which your legs come over during the tumble. For example, reaching outside your left knee with your right hand will mean your legs tumble over to the right-hand side, rather than directly over the centre line of your body. --- Page 143

knee. Note how this affects the angle at which your legs come over during the tumble. For example, reaching outside your left knee with your right hand will mean your legs tumble over to the right-hand side, rather than directly over the centre line of your body. --- Page 143 Text --- Timing The only way to learn the timing of your tumble turn – when to start the tumble in order to plant your feet solidly on the wall – is through trial and error. The variables include your degree of flexibility, the speed at which you tumble, and the pace at which you approach the wall. 1. Swim toward the wall at the end of your lane. For the last few strokes, it’s OK to look ahead more than you usually would. When you feel you’re one or two strokes from the end of the lane, allow yourself to glide forward with one arm extended. Start your tumble once your hand’s about 50 cm from the wall. 2. You’re aiming to tumble over very slightly short of the wall, as your momentum will carry you a small way. Aim to land with your legs bent and your feet squarely on the wall. Your body should be sideways, rather than fully upside-down: apply the knowledge you got from the previous drill to achieve this. 3. For now, just keep practising, adjusting the point at which you tumble until --- Page 144 Text --- you always land with your feet solidly planted on the wall. --- Page 145 Text --- Underwater kick, dolphin --- Page 146 Text --- Underwater kick, freestyle DRIVE FROM THE WALL The final element of a good tumble turn is your drive away from the wall.

solidly planted on the wall. --- Page 145 Text --- Underwater kick, dolphin --- Page 146 Text --- Underwater kick, freestyle DRIVE FROM THE WALL The final element of a good tumble turn is your drive away from the wall. Doing this well can gain you a lot of ground. It also sets you up to start swimming from a moving, rather than a standing, start. Four key elements have to be combined to get good drive. 1 Pushing off strongly This depends on having your feet planted firmly on the wall in a position that means they won’t slip. If you find this is a problem, go back to the timing drill and practise more. Never push off down, toward the bottom of the pool; push off parallel to the surface, at the same depth as you ended up after the tumble. --- Page 147 Text --- 2 Rotation back to a face-down position After pushing off, you need to rotate your body so that instead of being on your side, you’re facing the bottom of the pool. As this is achieved, step 3 will already have begun. 3 Kicking to maintain momentum Top swimmers kick underwater to maintain speed and delay the moment when they come back to the surface. Some swimmers do this using a flutter kick, most prefer to use butterfly kicks. If you have enough breath for this, experiment to see which suits you best. 4 Surfacing strongly Getting maximum drive from the wall requires striking a balance between distance and speed. Never let yourself slow down underwater to such an extent that you’re gliding slower than you would be swimming. It’s important to get back to the surface while you’re still travelling at a good speed. Otherwise, your first few strokes will be spent

alternate sides, simply by rolling your body. Don’t move your arms or turn your neck to breathe, just roll your body. 3. After one length, take off your fins and put your pull buoy between your ankles (not your thighs as usual) or calves. Swim two lengths like this, concentrating on rolling your body with each stroke. 4. Take a 10-or 15-second rest, and repeat until you have done 15 lengths in total. --- Page 159 Text --- Fins off and pull buoy between ankles Top tip USE YOUR KICK FOR BALANCE, NOT SPEED In open-water events, which tend to be over longer distances, your kick’s key job is to maintain your body position and balance your arm stroke, not to provide forward movement. Aim to make small, neat kicks. If your feet sometimes cross, pointing your toes will help prevent this. TECHNIQUE: LEG KICK The leg kick for open-water is the same as for pool swimming, a flutter kick. There’s no need to make big changes, though a kick with low amplitude (the distance your feet move from top to bottom) creates less drag. --- Page 160 Text --- KICKING RHYTHM If you normally use a four-or six-beat kick, you may want to adjust your kicking rhythm. Kicking your legs isn’t a very energy-efficient way to get propulsion, and over the long distances of open-water events a high kicking cadence is very draining. If you’re about to climb on to a bike and ride 40km, then run 10km, this is a particularly bad idea. As a result, endurance swimmers and triathletes rely less on their legs than pool swimmers, except at the start or finish. They mostly use a two-beat kick, and gain less than 5 per cent of their propulsion from their legs. As a comparison, pool swimmers

is a particularly bad idea. As a result, endurance swimmers and triathletes rely less on their legs than pool swimmers, except at the start or finish. They mostly use a two-beat kick, and gain less than 5 per cent of their propulsion from their legs. As a comparison, pool swimmers get closer to 10 per cent of their propulsion from their legs. Head position, direction, and sighting The most streamlined head position for freestyle is to be looking straight down, rather than ahead. In the pool, most swimmers are forced to compromise this: they need to avoid crashing into people in front, and to spot the wall for turns. These aren’t problems in open water, so it’s possible to keep a perfect head position most of the time. The only difficulty is that in an open-water swim you need to check where you’re going from time to time. Training to swim in a straight line is a big help, and the next drill (balanced arms) should be useful. But you will still need to ‘sight’ – lift your head to see whether you’re on course for the turn or finish you’re aiming for: 1. Finish breathing out until your leading hand enters the water. 2. Lift your head forward while pressing down (rather than pulling back) with your leading hand. At the same time, kick harder. 3. As your head rises, take a mental photo of the course, and immediately drop it back down into the streamlined position. Don’t take a breath – if your head comes out that high, you’ve lifted it too far. 4. Take an arm stroke, during which your body rolls to the side allowing you to take a breath as usual. --- Page 162 Text --- Balanced-arms drill This exercise is useful for a) finding

For the final length, put the pull buoy on the side of the pool and swim full stroke. As you swim the third length, try to pull together the sensations from the previous two lengths: first, a neat, steady flutter kick; second, a sensation of your legs being close to the surface and supported.

per se, we needed a company that understood triathlon swimming and, crucially, how to coach it in a real context. Swim Smooth has built an impressive international reputation and it is exciting that we can now utilise their experience and skills as part of our coaching programme. Swim Smooth will add significant value to our coaching delivery as the demand for coaches in the fast growing modern Olympic sport of triathlon continues to grow year on year. Feedback from the coaches has always mentioned how the Swim Smooth section has improved their swim coaching. New and developing coaches have engaged with Swim Smooth coaching methods and new drills. One of Swim Smooth’s introductory breathing drills – ’breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe’ – is an excellent example of a simple but highly effective drill any coach can use to make an immediate improvement with any level of athlete. Swim Smooth’s methodical step-by-step approach to swim coaching helps remove the clutter which many swimmers report they feel when trying to improve their technique. We look forward to a long and successful partnership with Swim Smooth, and seeing the benefits and added value for our coaches, athletes and the wider sport. —Paul Moss, Coaching Development Manager, British Triathlon —Giles O’Brien, Coach Education Officer, British Triathlon --- Page 9 Text --- Preface The 11-Year-Old Girl You are in the pool one day, enjoying being in the water and working on your freestyle swimming. You are pretty happy with the progress you have been making and swimming is definitely becoming easier and a little quicker too – which is really satisfying. You set off for a few more laps and then suddenly in the next lane over a young girl jumps in the water, probably about 11 years old, and comes flying past you like you are barely moving.

becoming easier and a little quicker too – which is really satisfying. You set off for a few more laps and then suddenly in the next lane over a young girl jumps in the water, probably about 11 years old, and comes flying past you like you are barely moving. Before you know it she has executed a perfect tumble turn and comes back past you the other way, a near blur of fast moving, perfectly synchronised arms and legs. If you are an adult who has been swimming for a little while you have almost certainly had a similar experience to this. It can be quite a shock and even disheartening. ‘How can she do that? She is just a kid!’. Don’t worry, everyone has been passed by a much faster swimmer at some point in their lives and made to feel a little inadequate. Kids are not as physically strong as adults and don’t have the option of muscling their way through the water; instead they must use a good stroke technique – and high levels of aerobic fitness – to propel themselves quickly forwards. The fact that someone so small with very little strength can swim so quickly shows you what amazing potential each of us has in the water if we too can develop these areas of our swimming. Try not to be disheartened by the speed of fast swimmers but instead see them as an inspiration: how a child can swim so well and be so comfortable in the water is an amazing thing and there are many lessons the aspiring adult swimmer can learn from them. This book is devoted to anyone looking to improve their freestyle swimming. You might be very new to swimming and are trying to become more comfortable in the

so comfortable in the water is an amazing thing and there are many lessons the aspiring adult swimmer can learn from them. This book is devoted to anyone looking to improve their freestyle swimming. You might be very new to swimming and are trying to become more comfortable in the water. Or perhaps you are a triathlete or open water swimmer looking to improve your speed and efficiency and move up through the field. Or you might be a top-age group or elite swimmer searching for a cutting edge in your races. Whatever your level, we have worked with hundreds of swimmers just like you, both in our coaching base in Perth, Australia and on our international clinic tours. We have developed and improved each and every one of those swimmers and as you will discover in this book, we know how to improve your individual swimming too. A big hello from one of the Swim Smooth Squads in Perth! --- Page 10 Text --- Before we get started on that, let’s take a quick look at the background behind Swim Smooth and how our coaching system came into existence. We Live Swimming Swim Smooth are based in Perth, Western Australia, and if you’ve ever been here you’ll understand why! We are very lucky to have fantastic outdoor pools, a beautiful ocean and a warm sunny climate to train in. We run coached swim sessions for adult swimmers like you every day, with around 300 swimmers choosing from 15 weekly sessions. Whatever your current ability level you would fit in nicely if you were here! We have beginners starting out who struggle to swim a lap at the moment, intermediate triathletes looking to improve their performances, age-group swimmers challenging themselves with swims of 20 km or more and elite triathletes

On the forum at the same time was someone going by the pseudonym ‘Younggun’ who posted some excellent advice about cycling and running. We struck up a few conversations via email about training philosophy and our shared interest in photography and after Younggun had attended one of our Swim Smooth Clinics in Windsor, I suggested he come over to Australia for six months and see how --- Page 16 Text --- we do things ‘Oz style’. A great friendship was born and in early 2008 Adam officially became my business partner in Swim Smooth. For the next 15 months we worked feverishly hard building and developing the Mr Smooth animation and the website as we now know it, all with the single-minded goal of helping the world’s triathletes and pool and open water swimmers improve their knowledge and understanding of what makes an efficient freestyle stroke for them. Adam’s work ethic is incredibly fastidious and together we started releasing the ideas and methods that I had been generating for the last few years in a manner that could be accessed easily by all, most notably the Swim Types system. Without Adam many of these ideas would have stayed just that – thoughts without any substance or practical application. We now blog on a weekly basis to over 52,000 people worldwide (as of November 2011) and would like to believe that we have helped create a movement against there being just a ‘one size fits all’ approach to swim coaching.

products on the market – some great and some not so great – and you can be assured that anything we feature gets our full seal of approval and is well worth considering for your own swimming – see Chapter 3. Please do not feel the need to rush out and buy every product we mention; the tips and techniques in this book will give you significant grounds for improvement in their own right without the assistance of these additional tools. A Quick Overview Let’s run you through the structure of the book: --- Page 20 Text --- We kick off in Chapter 2 with an introduction to freestyle swimming and cover some of the terminology and conventions we use in this book. If you are new to swimming you will find this extremely useful and it will help you make sense of how swimmers and coaches talk about swimming. We then go on in Chapter 3 and take a look at some of the training equipment you might use and how to select the right tools to assist you in the best way possible. Next we will take a look at the Swim Smooth philosophy of ‘The Three Keys’, which are: 1) Stroke Technique; 2) Swim Specific Fitness Training; 3) Open Water Skills. These Three Keys form the outline structure of this book and as we will explain, working on all three elements of your preparation at the same time will give you the best improvements in your swimming. In fact if you have been swimming for a while and hit a speed and efficiency plateau it is likely you have the balance wrong between these three elements of your preparation.

In fact if you have been swimming for a while and hit a speed and efficiency plateau it is likely you have the balance wrong between these three elements of your preparation. Stroke Technique (Key 1) takes a close look at each area of the freestyle stroke and how it should be performed. We will clear up a lot of misconceptions or things you might have read on the internet that date back 15 or 20 years or even earlier! Within this chapter we will show you how to improve each area of your stroke so that you become more comfortable in the water and become faster and more efficient at the same time. If you have primarily focused on reducing drag up until now you will find the section on developing your catch and propulsion particularly fascinating. Next we have a dedicated section on developing your stroke rate. This is an area that many intermediate swimmers struggle with and can be key to improving your stroke technique and performing well in open water. Even if you are a relative beginner, developing some rhythm in your stroke can be the key to improving your comfort levels and confidence swimming in the great outdoors. Then we move on to our fascinating Swim Types system – showing you the six classic ways in which people swim freestyle, including the distinct personality that each Swim Type tends to have. This is a great way to bring all the sections of the book together into a simple step-by-step process for you to follow (Appendix B) that is highly tailored to your individual needs. Before leaving Stroke Technique we will take you through a special feature showing you how to perform a video analysis on your own swimming and how to identify common flaws in

which are free: Our Stroke Technique Website: www.swimsmooth.com The Swim Smooth website contains a wealth of interesting articles about developing your swimming. In relation to this book you will find the animations and video clips very insightful – in fact in some chapters we have given you links to the website to follow for just this reason. Mr Smooth and Miss Smooth Animations Available for free at our main website www.swimsmooth.com, our animated swimmers ‘Mr Smooth’ and ‘Miss Smooth’ show you two ideal freestyle strokes in action. They demonstrate one of the two ideal Swim Types each, the Smooth (Mr Smooth) and the refined-Swinger (Miss Smooth). These animations are extremely powerful visualisation tools and we highly recommend downloading the free application to your desktop so that you can view them from any angle or at any speed. For best effect, watch them just before you go for a swim and jump in the water and reproduce their strokes! Many swimmers have taken minutes off their times just by doing that. The Swim Types Website: www.swimtypes.com Our dedicated website explaining the Swim Type system is well worth viewing in relation to Chapters 17 to 23 of this book as it shows you video clips of each of the Swim Types in action. We hope you benefit from the Swim Type development processes in Appendix B; if you do, consider going on and purchasing the Swim Type Development Guide for your type. This is supplied as a PDF digital download to your computer and contains an even more detailed development process over and above that contained in this book.

or suggest an idea you have that would help you and other swimmers. We get inspired by hearing your stories so please let us know! Coaching DVDs If you have enjoyed this book then an excellent accompaniment to it would be one of our coaching DVDs, which cover many of the drills and techniques here but in a visual format. In the DVDs we are able to show you great swimmers (including Olympic champions) in action, and visualising their strokes in the water can be hugely beneficial for your own stroke. At the time of writing we have three DVDs to offer you: 1. The Learn To Swim Programme is a fantastic way to learn freestyle from scratch with no prior swimming experience. We build up your stroke technique and confidence one step at a time, helping you adjust to having your face in the water, developing your breathing technique and constructing your stroke piece by piece. You will be amazed at how quickly you develop and you will soon be swimming your first laps of smooth relaxed freestyle – exhilarating! This DVD covers your first strokes in freestyle in much more depth than we have scope to do in this book. 2. Perfect for intermediate swimmers, The DVD Boxset is actually two DVDs and a CD ROM taking you through all aspects of stroke technique; all the drills you need to improve; open water swimming development and techniques, and a full 25- session training plan to follow in the pool. Featuring Olympic Gold Medallist Bill Kirby who has an extremely smooth stroke for you to watch and recreate yourself. 3.

Five star reviews aplenty! All these DVDs are available in our store at www.swimsmooth.com/products --- Page 25 Text --- CHAPTER 2 Introduction to Freestyle Swimming The Freestyle swim stroke, often called Front Crawl in many parts of the world, is the fastest of the four competitive strokes and also the one best suited to long distance events. In the elite swimming world it is the only stroke that is raced for distances of 400 m and longer. Freestyle is unique in that the swimmer has their face in the water for most of the stroke before rotating to the side to breathe very low to the surface. Breathing is a significant challenge when learning freestyle and the struggle to get enough air, without taking on water, is a dominant feature of many beginners’ experiences. Freestyle is the fastest of the four competition strokes. The body rotates along the long axis of the spine during the stroke, which helps the swimmer engage their chest, back and core muscles effectively on every stroke. The lack of vertical movement in comparison to butterfly or breaststroke allows good swimmers to sit very high in the water minimising their drag profile. In comparison to backstroke, freestyle has biomechanical advantages, allowing a better propulsive technique in the water. For triathlon and open water swimming, freestyle is a

The lack of vertical movement in comparison to butterfly or breaststroke allows good swimmers to sit very high in the water minimising their drag profile. In comparison to backstroke, freestyle has biomechanical advantages, allowing a better propulsive technique in the water. For triathlon and open water swimming, freestyle is a much more compact and ‘narrow’ stroke than butterfly and breaststroke making it ideal for swimming in close confines to other swimmers and obviously has significant sighting advantages for holding a straight line between points over swimming on your back in backstroke. --- Page 26 Text --- ADAM: If you can swim breaststroke comfortably but are new to freestyle you’ll find it a revelation when you get the hang of it. With practice you will be able to feel a real sense of rhythm in the stroke without the stop-go action of breaststroke. It’s a bit like breaking out into a run after walking. As we will see in this book, the exact freestyle technique used by great swimmers varies depending on the race distance, the race environment (e.g. pool vs. open water) and to some extent personal preference. However, the key elements of a great stroke are common between all these great swimmers. Swimming Terminology As coaches and swimmers we have names for each area of the stroke and conventions we use for elements like your swimming speed and the length of your stroke as you swim. Don’t be put off by this, this ‘jargon’ is pretty simple and makes a lot of sense when you get the hang of it. The good news is that, for the large part, the terminology used in this book is common all over the world which means you should be able to understand most things written on the internet about swimming and coaching

a lot of sense when you get the hang of it. The good news is that, for the large part, the terminology used in this book is common all over the world which means you should be able to understand most things written on the internet about swimming and coaching after reading this section. First, let’s take a look at each part of the freestyle stroke cycle and the names we use for each in Figures 2.1 and 2.2. Broadly speaking the arm stroke cycle can be split into two halves: below the water the ‘catch’, ‘pull’ and ‘push’ phases create propulsion to push the swimmer forwards; above the water the arm carries over the surface during the ‘recovery’ before returning to the front of the stroke with ‘hand entry’ and ‘extension’.

movement of the swimmer along the long axis of their spine as they swim, a little like being skewered on a kebab stick (as crude as that sounds!). This roll helps the swimmer generate more power, reduces drag and assists the arms in recovering over the surface. Find out how to develop good rotation in Chapter 11. ‘Body Position’ refers to how high a swimmer sits in the water, particularly the level of the hips and legs. A low-lying body position creates lots of drag as the frontal profile is much larger. You can find out more about this area of stroke technique in Chapter 8. ‘Bilateral Breathing’ refers to breathing to both sides when you swim, if not in turn then regularly swapping sides. ‘Unilateral Breathing’ means the swimmer only ever breathes to a preferred side, either the left or right. Swim Smooth strongly recommend the ability to be able to breathe equally well to both sides, for the benefits of doing so see Chapter 7 and Key 3: Open Water Adaptation. ‘The Bow Wave’ is the wave formed by your body as you pass through the water; it’s a term taken from boating where the wave shape is seen against a boat’s bow. The bow wave forms as your head passes through the water with a slight rise in the water’s surface in front of the head followed by a dip past the head and neck area, known as the ‘trough’. A good freestyle breathing technique takes advantage of the bow wave as the --- OCR from Page 28 Image 1 --- freestyle stroke terminology “body position” is the height of the swimmer’s body, hips, legs and feet in the water mn” or “bod I” is the rotation of the at side with every stroke --- Page 29

This is known as ‘Bow-Wave Breathing’. The bow wave is formed by the head and body passing through the water. ‘Feel For The Water’ is a term used to describe the sensation of the water on your hands and arms as you swim. When a swimmer is feeling the water well they are timing their stroke movements to create good propulsion resulting in a good feeling of connection with the water. We use drills and visualisations to help you develop this in your own stroke, see Chapter 13. ‘Stroke Length’ is a commonly discussed area of swimming as we shall see in this book. The normal way to measure it is to count how many strokes you take to swim a length of the pool counting both arms. A lower number indicates a longer stroke. When quoting this figure you should always mention the length of the pool too – e.g. 25 yd, 25 m, 33 m, 50 yd, 50 m. Typical stroke counts in a 25 m pool are between 11 and 30 strokes per length – which you will often see abbreviated to SPL. ‘Stroke Rate’ (not to be confused with stroke length) is how many strokes you take per minute, counting both arms. This is like cadence on a bicycle except with cadence you only count one leg, not both! The higher your stroke rate, the faster you are turning your

minimises the head lift to minimise additional drag. Training Session Terminology Please see Appendix C for special abbreviations and terminology relating to training sessions. --- Page 33 Text --- CHAPTER 3 Swimming Equipment There is a wide variety of swimming equipment and training aids available on the market, which are designed to target specific areas within the freestyle stroke. Whilst some swimmers prefer to train without the use of any pool equipment, at Swim Smooth we are very passionate about using the right tools for your stroke and incorporating them into your programme in the most effective way. PAUL: There will be those swimmers who prefer to keep swimming as simple and pure as they can and will choose to swim with as little gadgetry as possible, but there are those who prefer to use all the latest gear and find this approach to be very enjoyable and in sync with their analytical personalities – each to their own we say! Personally, I’m a bit of a gadget guy but I also love swimming totally free, especially when in the open water. In this review we have categorised a wide range of training aids into ‘essentials’, ‘highly recommended’, ‘not-essential but nice to have’ and ‘not recommended’ and we aim to show you how each might help you with your swimming. Whilst this is not an exhaustive list of all the pool toys you will find out there, it will give you a very good idea of what to look out for. Californian swimming technology company Finis is one of the most innovative companies in this area and for this reason we have tried and tested all of its products, our favourite ones of which feature prominently below. Other manufacturers making good swim gear and training aids are Speedo, TYR, Aquasphere,

excellent clarity and anti- fog properties. We recommend that female swimmers with small faces try out junior size goggles for a better fit. Goggle clarity in the open water is essential and will make you feel much more comfortable in this environment. 3. Fins/Flippers – these are excellent tools to have in your swim kit bag as they help to develop good ankle flexibility and provide extra propulsion when performing technical drills. As long as fins are used correctly and with a purpose you should not consider them as ‘cheating’ but as an aid to assist you in your swim stroke development. Choose fins that are slightly longer than the shorter ‘zoomer’ style as they will be more comfortable and encourage a better kicking action for drill work. There are many training tools you can use to assist you with your swimming, some useful, some not so useful. For a review of each see the main text. Unfortunately due to health and safety regulations in some swimming pools (especially in the UK) fins are not allowed but it’s always worthwhile checking with your local pool to see if they will let you use them. Fins are so beneficial for helping you develop your stroke technique that if it were a choice between two pools with one allowing the use and the other not, always go to the one that does. If you’re not fortunate enough to have more than one pool in your local vicinity, --- Page 35 Text --- enquire with your pool as to whether they might allow fins in a session one night per week. 4. Pull Buoys – for those with ‘Sinky Leg Syndrome’ pull buoys can become a bit of a crux and should not be used to simply mask a low body position or

enquire with your pool as to whether they might allow fins in a session one night per week. 4. Pull Buoys – for those with ‘Sinky Leg Syndrome’ pull buoys can become a bit of a crux and should not be used to simply mask a low body position or a scissor leg kick. It is generally less challenging aerobically to swim with a pull-buoy and this can lead to de-training if they are overused. On the flip side, they allow you to specifically focus your attention on the catch phase of the stroke. In our programmes we use pull buoys regularly during sculling drills to build up your ‘feel for the water’ but you should always remember to emphasise good rotation as everyone has a bit of a tendency to flatten off in their stroke when using one. A mid-length rubber fin (left) is much better for performing drills than a shorter zoomer-style fin (right) due to the extra propulsion and flexibility it offers. FIGURE 3.3 There is a huge variety of paddles on the market. Highly Recommended 5. Finis Freestyler Paddles – if you only purchase one pair of paddles, our recommendation is for the ‘Freestylers’ by Finis. These paddles work to improve your hand entry and alignment in the water and are designed to fall off your hand if used incorrectly giving you immediate feedback about your stroke. --- Page 36 Text --- Stroke rate and lap interval beepers by Wetronome and Finis sit under your swimming cap and beep to you a lap-pace or stroke rate as you swim. 6.

wary of the desire to become stronger by using them – it’s usually the stronger athletes, who need a little more finesse in their stroke, who tend to reach for the big dinner-plate paddles before anyone else in the squad. 9. Finis Snorkel – snorkels are a good way of taking the breathing action out of the freestyle stroke giving you uninterrupted time to focus on other aspects of your stroke like rotation and your catch. Many swimmers find that they feel quite claustrophobic when using a snorkel because they subtly reduce the air flow and make the process more hypoxic than normal swimming. For this reason it is well worth trying one before investing to see how you get on with them. 10. Finis Tech Toc – developing your body rotation can feel like quite an alien concept for those who have swum completely flat for years but the Tech Toc helps you to tune into the rhythm and timing of this essential part of your stroke. The Tech Toc is a hollow cylinder containing a large ball bearing, which sits on your lower back held in place by a waist strap. As you swim it provides an audible click and kinaesthetic sensation as to how well you are rotating. Its name comes from the fact that if you are rotating efficiently you will hear and feel the ball bearing roll to one end of the tube and make a ‘toc’ sound and then with the next stroke it should roll to the other end and make a ‘toc’ sound. If you are not rotating well enough it will remain silent! 11. Swimming watches by Finis, Garmin and Swimovate – great for gadget lovers everywhere! These sophisticated devices use accelerometers to be able to tell each time you take

how far and how straight you have swum. Not Recommended 12. Board Shorts – many novice male swimmers think that figure hugging bathers should only be worn by more serious ‘professional’ swimmers but nothing could be further from the truth! Baggy shorts add a huge amount of drag and pull your body position down low in the water – this is the last thing you need when working on your swimming. Switch to some proper swimming bathers and give your stroke an instant lift – literally! 13. Kick Boards – we find that kick boards are not effective training aids for most adult swimmers. If you suffer from poor body position and a weak kick, using a buoyant kick board at the front of the stroke is only going to exacerbate this and place you in a very uneconomical position with your front end lifted. We prefer to practise kicking sets without the use of a float and with or without fins in a more specific torpedo or side-lying position in the water. The training sessions in Appendix C show you examples of how to introduce many of these tools into your training sessions. --- Page 39 Text --- CHAPTER 4 The Three Keys to Better Freestyle Swimming The Swim Smooth coaching philosophy is based on many decades of combined experience of coaching swimmers and triathletes in Perth and around the world. Our coaching team have worked with thousands of swimmers of all ability levels from beginner to elite competitor and developed highly effective coaching methods for every type of swimmer. We also work and interact with hundreds of swimming coaches around the world both in person and through our Coaches Network on the internet. Through all of this coaching experience, one thing has proven to be true time and

is much more suited to this environment. By performing regular open water skills sessions (in the pool in winter) alongside your technique sessions, your stroke technique will naturally develop in the right direction to be efficient in the open water. If you are a triathlete this is especially vital for you. Taking Time Out of Your Swim Splits Another way to explain the importance of the three keys is to look at things in terms of time saving. Let’s say you were a triathlete preparing for Olympic Distance races where the swim leg is 1500 m in open water. At the moment you swim around thirty minutes for 1500 m and you set yourself a target of swimming six minutes quicker, what is the best way to go about making this improvement? Most triathletes in this situation would try to make this improvement by focusing purely on the efficiency of their stroke technique. Of course, this is a worthy goal but you would greatly increase your chances of success by splitting things out and looking to get two minutes each from your technique, fitness and open water skills instead. Or --- Page 42 Text --- looking at this another way, if you did improve your stroke efficiency to the tune of six minutes you would have left those fitness and open water improvements on the table and you could then be swimming much more quickly still.

As someone interested in improving your swimming you’ve probably watched Olympic swimmers on TV or on YouTube. If you have a good club at your local pool you might have seen some very good junior swimmers up close and if you’ve been to a large triathlon or open water event you’ve perhaps watched the elite wave of the race. Comparing all of these great swimmers, all with different builds and all racing in different environments, you will have noticed a large range of stroke styles: some have strong kicks, others nearly no kick, some a high elbow recovery, others a straight arm recovery, some with a short punchy style, others with a long flowing stroke. Yet all of them are swimming extremely quickly. The stroke styles of elite swimmers can look quite different but there are common elements of great stroke technique between them all. Whilst you might never swim quite as quickly as an Olympic champion, just like them you should look to develop your own stroke technique into one that suits your body type and the environment in which you are racing. Whatever your chosen style, you should share the common elements of good technique with those of the elite swimmers so that you can have low levels of drag and high levels of propulsion in your own stroke. ADAM: Developing a good freestyle stroke technique is essential to swim well in the pool and open water alike.

A good stroke technique reduces your drag and increases your propulsion for a given level of effort, meaning you move more quickly or more easily through the water – or both! TABLE 5.1 Olympic champions in numbers. Note the range of stroke rates, speeds and recovery styles of all these great swimmers. Grant Hackett during 1500 m World Record swim: 76 strokes per minute, swimming speed: 0:58/100 m, arm recovery style: high elbow, height: 1.97 m (6’5” 1/2”) Ian Thorpe during 400 m World Record swim: 72 strokes per minute, swimming speed: 0:55/100 m, arm recovery style: high elbow, height: 1.95 m (6’5”) Michael Phelps during 200 m World Record swim: 77 strokes per minute, swimming speed: 0:51/100 m, arm recovery style: high elbow, height: 1.93 m (6’4”) Emma Snowsill during Gold Medal Winning Triathlon at Beijing Olympics: 86 strokes per minute, swimming speed: 1:19/100 m (O W 1500 m No Wetsuit), arm recovery style: straight, height: 1.61 m (5’3”) Laure Manadou during Gold Medal Winning 400 m At Athens Olympics: 108 strokes per minute, swimming speed: 1:01/100 m, arm recovery style: straight, height: 1.78 m (5’10”) Drills, such as this kicking-on-your-side exercise, are extremely useful to help you develop an improved stroke technique. --- Page 45 Text --- Shortly we are going to examine each aspect of good freestyle technique in turn, pointing out common flaws and showing you step-by-step methods to remove them from your stroke.

an improved stroke technique. --- Page 45 Text --- Shortly we are going to examine each aspect of good freestyle technique in turn, pointing out common flaws and showing you step-by-step methods to remove them from your stroke. We will clear up a few common misconceptions along the way and refer to Appendix A, which contains descriptions of the key drills and visualisations targeting different areas of your stroke technique. These drills are the standard set that we’ve developed and refined with our large training squads in Perth, Western Australia and also around the world with our popular Swim Smooth Clinic series. They are designed to be used by all levels of swimmer from beginner to elite swimmer – you’ll find them very useful to improve your own swimming. In Chapter 15 we will take a more in-depth scientific look at swimming efficiency, giving a lot of background on the coaching advice we offer to swimmers. If you are technically minded you will find this a very interesting section of the book as we put some classic misconceptions about stroke efficiency to bed. Later in Chapter 17 we’ll take a look at our innovative Swim Types system, which examines the six distinct styles that people use to swim freestyle. When you identify your own Swim Type then we will be able to give you some very specific advice to improve your stroke, referring back to the individual methods in Chapters 7–14 as we do so. This is an extremely powerful way to identify flaws in your stroke if you are not fortunate enough to have a coach watching over you when you swim. --- Page 46 Text --- CHAPTER 6 Stroke Flaws – Cause and Effect A Never-Ending Pursuit Working on your stroke technique is not just something for swimmers

way to identify flaws in your stroke if you are not fortunate enough to have a coach watching over you when you swim. --- Page 46 Text --- CHAPTER 6 Stroke Flaws – Cause and Effect A Never-Ending Pursuit Working on your stroke technique is not just something for swimmers new to freestyle; every swimmer of any ability level should regularly work on their stroke – it’s a never- ending pursuit. Nearly all swimmers, even those who are swimming very well, have areas of their technique they could improve on significantly which would make their stroke more efficient, relaxed, faster or offer better endurance. Even an Olympic champion with a fantastic stroke will still spend a significant portion of their weekly training maintaining and reinforcing their technique; without doing so their performances could easily drop off. Working on your stroke technique does not sound very exciting but it can actually be a lot of fun: it brings variety to your swim training and gives you a different sort of challenge to that offered by fitness training. We will use the Swim Smooth drill set (Appendix A) to assist you in this task; each drill or visualisation is a highly developed tool to help you work on the weaker areas in your stroke technique. Cause and Effect Before we start looking at each area of the freestyle stroke, it is important to remember that when you jump in the water to correct your stroke you need to keep things simple at all times. To help you do this, Swim Smooth uses a simple but deceptively powerful coaching philosophy called ‘Cause and Effect’. Cause and Effect says that for every stroke flaw (the effect) there is an underlying cause for it. This is powerful because it helps you get to the root

all times. To help you do this, Swim Smooth uses a simple but deceptively powerful coaching philosophy called ‘Cause and Effect’. Cause and Effect says that for every stroke flaw (the effect) there is an underlying cause for it. This is powerful because it helps you get to the root cause of stroke flaws and fix them for good. For instance, a scissor kick where the legs part excessively creating a lot of drag is triggered by a loss of balance from crossing the centre line with the lead hand in front of the head (the cause). By removing the crossover you will fix the scissor kick, without ever thinking about your kick itself. The conventional approach to fixing a scissor kick is lots of kicking technique work and focus on keeping the legs together but ultimately the scissor kick will keep returning as the underlying cause has not been removed. Note that ‘Cause and Effect’ also reduces the number of problems that you have to fix in your stroke. You could look at a swimmer and say that they hold their breath underwater and that they have a poor body position with low legs. This is not really two --- Page 47 Text --- problems though, it is just one: by improving their exhalation the swimmer will reduce the excess buoyancy in their chest and help bring the legs up high. We are sure you are beginning to see the power of this methodology, especially if you have felt a little ‘cluttered’ in the past by trying to correct multiple aspects of your stroke at the same time. As we look at each area of freestyle stroke technique in turn we will take a look at the cause of every stroke flaw and provide you with drills and visualisations

a little ‘cluttered’ in the past by trying to correct multiple aspects of your stroke at the same time. As we look at each area of freestyle stroke technique in turn we will take a look at the cause of every stroke flaw and provide you with drills and visualisations to remove that underlying cause. OK, let’s get to work! --- Page 48 Text --- CHAPTER 7 Breathing It would not be an overstatement to say that breathing technique is the single most important aspect of freestyle swimming. Good breathing technique is much more challenging in freestyle than the other strokes because the head is in the water at all times and the swimmer must keep their head low and breathe out to the side very near the surface. For swimmers learning freestyle, breathing can be extremely challenging and it’s normal to experience high levels of anxiety about getting enough air and not swallowing water! If you feel this way then developing your exhalation into the water and your bow-wave breathing technique is going to be critical to improving your swimming; these are the first two aspects of breathing technique we’ll look at here. Don’t worry, work on the technique of breathing and you’ll soon be feeling much more calm and relaxed when swimming freestyle. Holding your breath underwater will cause a build-up of CO in your lungs and 2 blood stream and make your swimming feel tense. For intermediate level swimmers, brushing up on bow-wave breathing and exhalation into the water is going to be useful for you and will make a real difference to your efficiency and level of relaxation. We also strongly encourage you to learn to breathe bilaterally, which is important as a natural way of keeping your stroke symmetrical and can even help you develop

‘brrrrrr’ sound of a motorboat or motorbike. As simplistic as this sounds it can really make a huge difference to your swimming. Exhaling into the water sounds easy but can be surprisingly hard to learn. For many swimmers it simply doesn’t feel like a natural thing to do. To develop good exhalation technique use the Sink Down Exercise in Appendix A. Experiment between exhaling into the water using either your mouth or nose or a mix of both; there’s no right or wrong here, see which feels more natural for you and then stick with that method. It should feel like you are sighing and not forcing the air out. Try to be loose and floppy as you sink down to remove all the tension from your body. Your ability to sink to the bottom of the pool during the Sink Down Exercise is totally determined by how relaxed and efficient your exhalation is into the water. Many swimmers with poor body positions would expect to sink like a stone but often the opposite is true and they find it harder to sink than other swimmers. This is an interesting insight into their swimming as it shows how their tendency to hold onto their breath is actually harming their body position: the excess buoyancy in the chest lifts their front end up but the body then pivots around its centre and so pushes the legs downward. Once you are able to sink down easily to the bottom of the pool with a nice relaxed exhalation try some easy laps of freestyle swimming. Simply focus on a smooth exhalation into the water using your normal breathing pattern to whichever side you feel most comfortable. For those who normally only breathe to one side, don’t be surprised if you notice that you

with a nice relaxed exhalation try some easy laps of freestyle swimming. Simply focus on a smooth exhalation into the water using your normal breathing pattern to whichever side you feel most comfortable. For those who normally only breathe to one side, don’t be surprised if you notice that you are suddenly able to go from breathing every two strokes to breathing every four strokes and feel more comfortable doing so. Sometimes breathing every two strokes does not physically give you enough time to exhale properly especially if you have a naturally high stroke rate. Develop your relaxation in the water using the Sink Down Exercise at the beginning of your training sessions. --- Page 50 Text --- PAUL: Traditionally swimmers were taught to hold their breath as it increases the level of buoyancy in the chest. This is certainly true but most swimmers already have plenty of buoyancy in the upper body, it is in the legs where it is lacking, especially if you are a triathlete with muscular legs. By smoothly exhaling into the water and removing excess buoyancy in the chest, we can counteract this and get your legs higher in the water. This is a classic example of our philosophy of ‘Cause and Effect’ in swimming. Elite swimmer Jono Van Hazel shows us his excellent exhalation technique through the nose. To really contrast the difference a good exhalation technique makes, trying swimming 100 m straight through as: 25 m exhaling smoothly 25 m holding your breath and exhaling at the last second 25 m exhaling smoothly 25 m holding again ADAM: The key point to remember with exhalation is that as swimmers we are not usually restricted by how much air we can get in but how efficiently we exhale out. Clearing the lungs smoothly before

SCREEN VISUALISATION When you are working on keeping your head position low in the water, use fins and aim for a Split Screen View with the lower goggle beneath the water and the upper goggle above. You should be able to see under and over the water at the same time. This is a useful visualisation to revisit when training or racing and your stroke starts to feel ragged, especially during long distance swims when it can be hard to maintain concentration. Keep one goggle under the water as you breathe and you will see the split screen view. PAUL: Have you ever wondered why elite sprinters breathe so infrequently during a 50 m or 100 m freestyle race? Even at the pointy end of the field a swimmer’s balance and alignment in the water can be thrown off by turning to take a breath, which can make the difference between first and last place in close races. As a result elite sprinters breathe as infrequently as they can. For distances over 100m we need to maintain a much more regular stream of air into the lungs by using a much more frequent breathing pattern: breathing only two or three times per 50 m is not an option over longer distances! With regular breathing we need to maintain a close eye on your stroke while you are taking a breath; it’s easy to switch your focus completely towards getting the air in, and it is then that things go wrong in your stroke technique. As we get into other areas of stroke technique we’ll often be asking you to let the breath take care of itself and maintain an awareness of another part of your stroke. Bilateral Breathing Bilateral breathing is the ability to breathe to the left and the

Under Kicking (Chapter 9). Swimmers who are focusing on making their stroke very long often try a two-beat kick to further reduce effort. For many swimmers with poor natural buoyancy or poor ankle flexibility this does not produce enough lift and their legs sink downward. Poor Core Stabilisation (Chapter 10). If you flex through your midsection and aren’t sure how to engage your core muscles to hold your backside and legs high then your legs will likely sink. Pressing Down On The Water During The Catch (Chapter 13). Many swimmers try and overpower the catch phase of the freestyle stroke and end up pressing down on the water with a straight arm. This lifts them up at the front end and sinks their legs at the rear. Poor Hip Flexibility (Chapter 29). Poor hip flexor flexibility from a lot of sitting at an office desk or lots of cycling (especially on tri-bars) can drag the legs low in the water. Work on a few simple stretches before you swim to promote range of movement around the hips. Swimmers with very poor body position normally have three or more of these issues in place in their stroke. For this reason there’s rarely a silver-bullet solution to improving your body position – it takes an all-round approach across many areas of your stroke. It’s important not to become frustrated with this but be calm and persistent in your approach. From the perspective of our Swim Types system, Arnies are the biggest sufferers of low-lying legs, and for very muscular Arnies it is quite possible that they can never achieve as super-high a body position in the water as some female swimmers can. That’s OK, any improvement in body position will reduce drag significantly and is well worth the effort of pursuing. Pressing

of low-lying legs, and for very muscular Arnies it is quite possible that they can never achieve as super-high a body position in the water as some female swimmers can. That’s OK, any improvement in body position will reduce drag significantly and is well worth the effort of pursuing. Pressing down during the catch, kicking from the knee and poor hip flexibility is dragging this swimmer’s legs low down in the water. --- Page 61 Text --- The term ‘swimming downhill’ is commonly offered on the internet as a way to help swimmers with ‘sinky leg syndrome’ to get their legs higher in the water by pushing down with their chest. You should be wary of trying this yourself as it can be very bad for your stroke if you are blessed with a good natural body position. Here Barbara has added significant drag to her frontal profile by being too low at the front. Head Position and Body Position Many coaches encourage all swimmers to push their heads down low into the water to help bring their legs upwards, this can be effective for a proportion of swimmers but very bad advice for others. At Swim Smooth we suggest you treat a low head position as a last resort, only using it to improve your body position if all else fails. This is because a very low head position has several disadvantages: It reduces your proprioception, or ‘body awareness’, in front of the head, making the development of a good hand entry and catch harder. It makes it hard to see forwards in open water, which damages your navigation and drafting abilities. As we will see in Chapter 36, drafting alone can save you up to 38% of your energy expenditure – a huge reduction that would be unwise

good hand entry and catch harder. It makes it hard to see forwards in open water, which damages your navigation and drafting abilities. As we will see in Chapter 36, drafting alone can save you up to 38% of your energy expenditure – a huge reduction that would be unwise to ignore. It bends your spine forward and thus harms your swimming posture, making crossovers in front of the head more likely (Chapter 10). --- Page 62 Text --- Furthermore, for swimmers with good stroke technique and good natural buoyancy, a low head position can bring their legs too high at the rear and make them feel very unbalanced and unstable in the water. For such swimmers this is exacerbated further when using a wetsuit where the extra buoyancy pushes their legs higher still. Adopting a higher head position is essential for these swimmers to regain their balance and swim well in a wetsuit. We’ll discuss this more with regard to Kicktastics in Chapter 20 and also in Chapter 38. You can choose from a range of head positions as you swim depending upon your individual stroke correction needs. Head technique is a very individual area of stroke technique, something that works for one swimmer will not necessarily work for another. Ian Thorpe’s Head Position The legendary Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe won four Olympic gold medals and set numerous world records in the 200 m and 400 m freestyle. Often held up as having one of the most efficient freestyle strokes of all time, as Ian developed his swimming as a junior he found that he needed to keep a very high head position with his eyes just beneath the surface looking forward. With a lower head his legs rose up out of the water and he lost balance in

strokes of all time, as Ian developed his swimming as a junior he found that he needed to keep a very high head position with his eyes just beneath the surface looking forward. With a lower head his legs rose up out of the water and he lost balance in his stroke and the effectiveness of his brilliant kick. Just like Ian, think about how your head position affects your swimming and choose the best position for your individual stroke. --- Page 63 Text --- Ian Thorpe used a very high head position when he swam, looking forwards with his goggles just beneath the surface. Heels Breaking the Surface The easiest way to check your body position is to ask a coach or friend to check if your heels are lightly breaking the surface as you swim. Make sure you are not doing this by bending excessively at the knee – your heels breaking the surface is only the sign of a good body position if you are achieving this with a good kicking technique, kicking mostly with a straight leg from the hip. PAUL: Some swimmers will kick their feet completely out of the water. Whilst this may appear to be very propulsive (especially when sprinting) the reverse is actually true and this action can create a huge amount of additional drag and wasted effort. In fact, an unpublished computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study of Australian sprinter Eamon Sullivan’s stroke (Olympic medallist and former holder of 50 m and 100 m world records) in 2010 by Matt Keys and the University of Western Australia [1], found that the only inefficiency in his stroke was that very occasionally his left foot would kick a little too high out of the water.

100 m world records) in 2010 by Matt Keys and the University of Western Australia [1], found that the only inefficiency in his stroke was that very occasionally his left foot would kick a little too high out of the water. For most of us, addressing this is something that would save us a fraction of a second per length, but when you can swim 50 m in a blistering 21.28 seconds like Eamon, every little counts! Reference 1. https://repository.uwa.edu.au/R/-?func=dbin-jump- full&object_id=29616&local_base=GEN01-INS01 --- Page 64 Text --- CHAPTER 9 Leg Kick For most swimmers, Swim Smooth recommends using a light flutter kick to keep your legs high in the water. This is called a 6-beat kick by swim coaches as there are six kicks per two arm strokes (a full stroke cycle). If you kick with a nice continuous flutter then you will naturally fall into a 6-beat pattern without too much conscious thought on your behalf. Leg kick can be seen to have two main purposes: firstly, to bring the legs up high in the water and so reduce drag; secondly, to generate propulsion. As we’ll discuss below, generating significant propulsion is something that is more important for elite pool sprinters. For triathletes and distance age-group swimmers, the main purpose of the kick is to balance and bring up the legs as high as possible, with minimum effort on your behalf, it is not to generate propulsion as such: Elite swimmers with a powerful 6-beat kick generate only around 10% to 15% of their propulsion with their legs when kicking hard in a race, the other 85% to 90% being generated with their arm stroke [1]. For elite swimmers this small contribution from the kick is worth having as elite races are very close and every fraction of a second

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
to 15% of their propulsion with their legs when kicking hard in a race, the other 85% to 90% being generated with their arm stroke [1]. For elite swimmers this small contribution from the kick is worth having as elite races are very close and every fraction of a second gained is critical. However, maximising the leg kick comes at a very high energy cost – for the effort they put in, the propulsion gained is small. Elite swimmers also have fantastic flexibility through the ankles, knees and hips, to the point where they nearly look double-jointed. This helps them generate foot angles that push water back behind them as they kick, propelling them forwards. For most age-group swimmers this level of flexibility is not realistically achievable unless it comes from a significant swimming background acquired during childhood. For triathletes, a very high level of ankle flexibility is undesirable for cycling and running as the lack of stability can easily lead to lower leg injuries such as calf problems and turned ankles. To generate propulsion from the leg kick a high amount of ankle flexibility is required. Elite swimmers are able to flex their feet well beyond straight. --- Page 65 Text --- For these reasons, developing a propulsive leg kick is unrealistic for most age-group swimmers and triathletes who may, at best, only generate 5 % of their propulsion from their legs. Over the longer distances raced by these swimmers, the energy saved by reducing kick effort is better utilised with the arm stroke instead, resulting in a faster more efficient stroke overall. Kicking from the Hip A good kicking technique is driven from the hip rather than from the knee; the knee itself is loose and relaxed and will bend slightly during the action. Triathletes are particularly prone

utilised with the arm stroke instead, resulting in a faster more efficient stroke overall. Kicking from the Hip A good kicking technique is driven from the hip rather than from the knee; the knee itself is loose and relaxed and will bend slightly during the action. Triathletes are particularly prone to driving the kick from the knee with a lot of knee bend, perhaps as if they are running or cycling in the water. This takes a lot of energy to maintain and creates a lot of drag as the front of the leg is presented to the water flow. Kicking from the knee also uses the large quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups, which burn a lot of oxygen. If you always seem out of breath when you swim, you could well be kicking too much from the knee in this way. Kicking from the hip with a relaxed straight leg is a much better swimming technique. It takes less energy and keeps the body high in the water resulting in much lower levels of drag. To develop this technique, use the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick And Swim Back drills from Appendix A. Paula (top) and Michelle (bottom) have contrasting kicking techniques at the same point in their strokes. Paula’s kick is driven from the knee, creating a lot of drag and starting to sink her legs downward. Michelle kicks with a much straighter leg driven from the hip, giving her a much higher body position. The Ballet Leg Kick Drill helps you to develop your kick technique from the hip – see Appendix A. --- Page 66 Text --- L–R: Toes lightly brushing; which can only be achieved by turning the toes inwards; not turning them outwards.

Leg Kick Drill helps you to develop your kick technique from the hip – see Appendix A. --- Page 66 Text --- L–R: Toes lightly brushing; which can only be achieved by turning the toes inwards; not turning them outwards. Turning Your Toes Inwards An important part of a good kicking technique is to turn your feet inwards slightly so that the big toes brush against each other as they pass. Many swimmers who struggle with their kicking do the opposite and turn their toes outwards. This creates drag and reduces the lift created by the kick. As you swim think about turning your toes in and brush your big toes lightly together as they pass with a tap-tap-tap action. You can practise doing this at any time when you swim, it’s particularly useful to try when you get a little tired and you feel like your stroke is becoming ragged – it will often bring things back together for you. --- Page 67 Text --- PAUL: Have you noticed how women tend to be better at kicking than men? Women are often more flexible than men but also have wider hips due to childbirth. The ‘Q-angle’ created between the hip and knee is more conducive to achieving this slightly pigeon-toed kicking position with the feet. This gives them an anatomical advantage over the guys and turning their toes in feels a lot more natural to them. Men with very narrow hips tend to find themselves kicking hard as their toes tend to do the opposite – turn outwards. So guys, you now have an excuse for why your kick isn’t ‘all that’ but don’t let this deter you. Work on turning your toes inwards to improve the effectiveness of your kick. Ankle Flexibility Even though you’re not looking for

toes tend to do the opposite – turn outwards. So guys, you now have an excuse for why your kick isn’t ‘all that’ but don’t let this deter you. Work on turning your toes inwards to improve the effectiveness of your kick. Ankle Flexibility Even though you’re not looking for propulsion from your kick, a lack of flexibility in your ankles can still hold you back. Very stiff ankles from field sports, running or cycling make the top of the foot stick out into the water flow. This creates resistance in itself but also pulls the legs downward, harming your body position and creating a lot of drag. Dorsi flexion (left) and Plantar flexion (right). THE SEA ANCHORS DRILL To experience this for yourself, experiment with using the Sea Anchors Drill. Using a pull buoy, swim 25 m with your toes pointed behind you (technical term: plantar flexion) as normal. Then bring your ankles to 90° with the toes pointing downward (dorsi flexion). Notice the instant and huge effect this has on your body position, which highlights the difference even small improvements in ankle flexibility can bring to your stroke. Using a pull buoy, try switching between dorsi and plantar flexed ankles to experience the effect it has on your body position. If you have very stiff ankles and cannot point your toes straight then we recommend a gentle stretching exercise to loosen off your ankles. You can perform this stretch at any time, perhaps in your office or in front of the TV at home. Don’t rush things, it will take many weeks and months to loosen your ankles off by stretching them little and often using the stretches below. --- Page 68 Text --- Sitting Ankle Stretch ADAM: Many swimmers think that using fins (flippers) in training is

A great 2-beat leg kick is poetry in motion and whilst it looks simple is deceptively difficult to master. Generally speaking we only recommend 2-beat kicks for those swimmers with a refined Swinger style (Chapter 22). The Classic Overglider (left) uses a large knee bend to kick-start their stroke after the long glide phase. Simply becoming aware of this, and by tuning up his rhythm, has allowed Chris to improve his kicking technique (right). --- Page 70 Text --- The timing for the 2-beat kick is much the same as that of the 6-beat kick in that as the right hand enters into the water the left leg should be driving down, and as the left hand enters into the water the right leg should be driving down. Opposite arm to opposite leg. Or, to think of it another way, as the left arm is midway through its propulsive catch phase the left leg should be driving down. The timing of a 6-beat kick is the same as a 2-beat one except that two additional kicks are placed between each kick bringing the total up to six in a stroke cycle. The kicks of a 6-beat kick are more of a flutter and should be smaller than those of a 2-beat. Sounds a bit complicated? It is, and we have not even hit the water yet! For most swimmers and triathletes Swim Smooth recommend a light 6-beat kick as the most efficient kicking technique. Some age-group swimmers have tried to combine a very long slow stroke style with a 2-beat kick but this is rarely effective. The tendency here is for the stroke to stall completely during the long pause between arm strokes and kicks, which harms the swimmer’s rhythm and timing. These swimmers are often seen from under the

combine a very long slow stroke style with a 2-beat kick but this is rarely effective. The tendency here is for the stroke to stall completely during the long pause between arm strokes and kicks, which harms the swimmer’s rhythm and timing. These swimmers are often seen from under the water using a substantial kick from the knee to literally kick-start the stroke back into motion after the pause but in doing so add significant drag at the back of the stroke from their knees sitting too deep in the water. We’ll take a closer look at this in the Overglider Swim Type profile and correction processes in Chapter 21. --- Page 71 Text --- PAUL: Back in August 2008 I decided to modify my stroke technique to emulate that of one of my heroes and mentors of open water swimming, seven-time World Marathon Swimming Champion Shelley Taylor-Smith. I already had a reasonable open water technique from my days as an elite triathlete but with my goal of swimming the English Channel in 2011 I wanted to be assured of my ability to maintain the most economical marathon swimming technique for 8–12 hours depending on conditions. I was concerned that my strong 6-beat kick and ‘longish’ stroke (34–35 strokes per 50 m) at a moderate stroke rate of 64 SPM (strokes per minute) might have been OK in events up to 1500 m but could potentially be too fatiguing above this. I was also concerned that this low stroke rate may not have the momentum to carry me through some of the swell and chop that I would encounter in the Channel. It took me over 10 weeks, swimming six sessions per week, before I started to get a true feeling of how this new stroke would work for me.

may not have the momentum to carry me through some of the swell and chop that I would encounter in the Channel. It took me over 10 weeks, swimming six sessions per week, before I started to get a true feeling of how this new stroke would work for me. Converting the 6-beat kick timing to 2-beat was very taxing mentally as I became slower to begin with and for this reason I wouldn’t recommend the transition to everyone. The new stroke involved combining a 2-beat kick with a significantly higher stroke rate (80 SPM) but not being concerned about taking more strokes per lap (increasing to 41–43 strokes per 50 m). What I gave away in stroke length I more than made up for in rate and rhythm. Now that I have mastered it, this new stroke is not only faster than the old one at any distance over 400 m (more details in Chapter 27) but is considerably more economical for the type of events I now do – marathon swimming. It doesn’t appear quite as smooth or textbook as my old style but in open water there are no points for style, only performance!

the fins and swim some laps of freestyle focusing solely on maintaining that sensation of reaching and rolling with each stroke, always being mindful of maintaining good alignment and not crossing over. Focus on stretching forwards with the lead arm as you press the other hand underneath the water towards the hip, with the sensation of needing to rotate this hip out of the way to allow you to finish the stroke off correctly. We’ll revisit this concept of ‘timing the rotation to the arm stroke’ in Chapter 13, which is about how the catch phase affects your rhythm and timing. Rotation and Bilateral Breathing All swimmers rotate a little more on a breathing stroke than a normal stroke. You do this subconsciously to ensure that you get your head in a good position to breathe. Over time this develops a good stroke habit and your rotation becomes good to that side. However, if you only ever breathe to one side (unilateral breathing) then we’ll see your rotation become good to that side but poor to the other. This will give you a lopsided stroke and is one of the major reasons why bilateral breathing is so important for maintaining symmetry in your rotation. The Right Amount of Rotation A great tool to help you monitor your rotation is the Finis Tech Toc. This neat device sits on your lower back, held by a strap around your waist. The Tech Toc has a large ball bearing in it that slides up and down the tube, making a loud ‘click’ when it hits the end. The ball bearing will only slide and hit the end of the tube if you are rotating sufficiently.

and rotation (Chapters 10 and 11), the combination of which will make your recovery much easier and more relaxed. If you struggle with your arm recovery make sure you try the exercise shown in Figure 11.8 to experience the difference better body rotation will make to your swimming. A Drill to Improve Your Arm Recovery The Popov Drill is named after the great Russian sprinter Alexander Popov who made this drill famous. Using fins, kick on your side as in 6-1-6 but straight away slowly slide the thumb of the top arm up the side of your body to your armpit. As soon as you reach your armpit slide the thumb back down to your hip before sliding it up again to the --- Page 87 Text --- armpit and then over into the water, stroking through onto the other side of the body. Repeat this continuously on the other side, swapping sides down the lap. The mantra of the drill is up-down-up-and-through. For a full description see Appendix A. The Popov Drill makes you adopt a relaxed arm recovery with good rotation in the stroke even though you probably won’t use such a tight elbow angle in your full stroke. Differing arm recovery styles from these elite swimmers: Jono Van Hazel on the right with a classic high elbow recovery, Mel Benson on the left with a lower swinging style. Arm Recovery in Elite Swimmers In the elite pool swimming world arm recovery styles vary considerably, with some swimmers using a classic high elbow technique while others use varying degrees of straighter arm recoveries. In the open water nearly all swimmers use a straighter arm recovery style which helps increase their arm clearance over waves and chop and also other swimmers in close proximity to them.

So much so that if you cross over or drop your elbow on entry then you’ll have trouble keeping them on your hands! The Finis Freestyler, a great paddle for working on your alignment and catch set- up. --- Page 95 Text --- CHAPTER 13 Catch and Pull-Through The catch and pull-through phases of the freestyle stroke are where a swimmer develops between 85% and 100% of their propulsion. The key to a great catch and pull is to feel the water during the catch phase and engage with it by pressing it in a backwards direction. Pressing the water back produces an opposite force propelling you forwards in the water. Problems that occur during the catch normally involve the swimmer pushing downward on the water, or sometimes to the side or even forward! Pushing downward on the water during the catch does not create any propulsion, instead it simply lifts the front end of the body upwards and sinks the legs. It’s no coincidence that swimmers with very low-lying legs in the water normally push down during the catch phase. If you suffer from a poor body position in your stroke then by improving your catch mechanics you will create more propulsion and your legs will be higher, lowering your drag. A win-win! Sam presses down on the water in comparison to elite swimmer Rhys Mainstone who presses the water backward by bending his elbow and tipping his wrist – great technique. ADAM: Many swimming coaches consider working on the catch and pull-through to be for advanced level swimmers only. At Swim Smooth we passionately believe that this is not the case! Approached in the right way, making improvements to your catch can

time to improve your catch set-up using the tips in this section – they can make improvements to your propulsion even without focusing on the catch itself. Whilst performing the Kick-On-Side, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills, introduce a new focus on the position and angle of the lead hand itself. During this exercise, are you dropping the wrist and showing the palm forwards or perhaps facing the palm sideways in a karate chop position? Have you dropped the elbow lower than the wrist and fingertips? Classic mistakes whilst kicking on your side: crossing over the centre line (left) and dropping the wrist and showing the palm forwards (right). To generate a good catch we need to get the hand and elbow in a good set-up position at this point in the stroke. As you kick on your side focus on keeping your elbow slightly higher than your wrist and the palm itself facing downward to the bottom of the pool. Create a very slight angle at the wrist so that the whole hand slopes slightly downward. ADAM: Many swimmers feel that their hand should be very near the surface of the water in this position but to achieve that they have to drop their elbow or wrist. It is much better to go a touch deeper with the hand to get into a better catch set-up position, you won’t lose any stroke length from doing so but you’ll gain propulsion from a much more effective catch. This slight tipping of the wrist is important as it will help you initiate the catch itself. If you create too much of a downward angle you will feel your hand pull down towards the bottom of the pool. This is a bit like having your hand out of a car window, changing the angle

pull- through technique. Imagine someone’s drawn a smiley face on the palm of your hand and as you swim show the face back to the wall behind you. Integrating Catch Drills into a Set Sculling and Doggy Paddle drills are best followed immediately by full-stroke swimming to transfer the movements and ‘feel for the water’ into your full stroke. We recommend that you swim these drills for around 10–20 m and then transition into full- stroke swimming. For example: 4 × 100 m as 15 m Scull #1 transitioning into 85 m freestyle 8 × 50 m as 15 m Scull #2 transitioning into 35 m freestyle 2 × 200 m freestyle with the 0-25 m and 100-125 m Doggy Paddle 4 × 100 m as 10 m Scull #1 into 10 m Doggy Paddle into 80 m freestyle As you transition into freestyle in the above sets use the Smiley-Face Visualisation as you swim. Right Can Feel Wrong! A key element of a good catch and pull-through is to press the water back behind you at all times. Relative to you, the water is already moving in this direction as you swim through it, so in a sense you are simply helping the water on its way. However, a poor catch and pull-through presses down on the water or shows the palm forwards to push against the flow. Since water is so dense you will feel a significant pressure on the palm --- Page 111 Text --- of your hand as you do this and it is quite possible you are misinterpreting that pressure as a good catch. The irony is that as you improve your catch and start pressing the water backwards, you will feel less pressure on the palm as you are no longer changing the water’s

medical term: medial epicondylitis. We have found from experience that the most common cause of Golfer’s Elbow in swimmers is a rapid snapping of the hand against the thigh from trying to really lengthen out the stroke at the back. Swimmers who do this can be seen to flick the water upwards at the rear as the hand comes out of the water with the fingers staying as the highest point during the arm recovery. To avoid this, focus on the elbow exiting the water at the back of the stroke before the hand does. Aim for around a 150° angle, starting the recovery with the elbow leading. Feel for the Water --- OCR from Page 112 Image 2 --- care 5 a et oe a bine I . q e --- Page 113 Text --- When a swimmer is creating good levels of propulsion they often report feeling ‘in tune’ with the water; they have a perception of feeling the water well with the hands and forearms. After spending some time out of the water even great swimmers lose this feel slightly as the subtle timing of the stroke is lost. Thankfully it only takes a few swim sessions to regain it. With your own swimming you too should aim to develop an appreciation and ‘feel for the water’ during the catch and pull phases of the stroke. The timing of your stroke is critical such that you can feel a smooth consistent pressure on the water as your body rotates rhythmically with the arm stroke. With this in mind we’ll look at improving the timing of your stroke in the final part of this chapter.

body rotates rhythmically with the arm stroke. With this in mind we’ll look at improving the timing of your stroke in the final part of this chapter. Developing Your Catch Step 3: Rhythm and Timing The Catch and Rhythm The catch and pull-through phases of the freestyle stroke have a huge knock-on effect on the stroke rate and rhythm of your stroke. A poor catch takes a long time to initiate as the water is pressed downward, to the side or even forwards. This slows down the stroke as the swimmer is forced to change the water’s direction. As you work on improving your catch technique and start to press the water backwards the catch phase takes less time as the water’s direction no longer needs to be changed. This lifts the overall tempo of the stroke and gives you a much greater sense of rhythm. PAUL: After following steps 1 and 2 of our catch development process you should already be feeling a much improved level of propulsion in your stroke, perhaps setting some personal bests or swimming much more easily for the same speed. That’s fantastic but to really integrate a better catch and pull-through into your stroke we need to pay attention to the rhythm and timing of your movements using some special drills. A swimmer with a good catch technique is constantly in motion, either extending forwards, catching the water or pressing it backwards. It’s important not to tear at the water by rushing the catch as this will cause the arm to slip through with little purchase. After the arm has finished extending, a good catch starts without delay as this gives the swimmer time to engage with the water in a high elbow position in front of the head. The drills in this section

ADAM: In Chapter 10 we discussed how good swimming posture helps connect the arm stroke to the body, allowing your body rotation to assist in driving the stroke. To maximise this transfer of power, the swimmer also needs good timing of the arm stroke in relation to the body roll. As a former Overglider with poor timing Unco is personally my favourite drill, it’s fantastic for tuning up the timing of my stroke. WATERPOLO DRILL Head-up Waterpolo swimming is a great drill to help upper-intermediate and advanced level swimmers to improve the rhythm of their stroke. It is especially effective for removing dead spots from stroke timing as it is almost impossible to swim head-up with a long pause in the stroke! As described in Appendix A, the key to the drill is to swim it quickly at near sprint pace to really focus you on a fast stroke rate. Perform it with your chin on the surface for just 25 m at a time. If you struggle to complete the drill well try it with fins to give you more lift and drive. Perform the drill as 4 × 25 m Waterpolo with about 15 seconds rest between each 25 m. Immediately transition into 100 m of steady paced swimming focusing on an easy rhythm to the stroke.

Waterpolo with about 15 seconds rest between each 25 m. Immediately transition into 100 m of steady paced swimming focusing on an easy rhythm to the stroke. PULL BUOY AND BANDS Swimming with a pull buoy between your legs and a rubber band around your ankles is a simple way to force you to focus on the rhythm of your stroke. The band holds your feet together eliminating any kick and adds some drag to the back of the stroke. The combination of a lack of kick and the extra drag created by the band forces you to keep the tempo of your stroke high, otherwise your legs will sink down low into the water. Focus on removing any dead spots from your stroke and also stretch through your core using the Liquorice Stretch Visualisation (Chapter 10) to help keep your legs up high. If you are lucky enough to be naturally buoyant and find this an easy drill then increase the difficulty by trying it without a pull buoy! --- Page 116 Text --- Using a Wetronome or Tempo Trainer to Improve Your Stroke Rhythm Wetronomes and Tempo Trainers are small electronic beepers that sit under your swim cap, which you can hear beeping as you swim. To focus on stroke rhythm the beepers are set to beep at a fixed stroke rate – for example 60 strokes per minute (SPM). As you swim, all you need to do is time your strokes to the beep to control your stroke rate precisely. The Finis Tempo Trainer Pro sits under your swim cap and beeps a steady stroke rhythm to you. These stroke beepers are particularly useful for helping you subtly raise or lower your stroke rate. If you have a tendency to fight the water with a large crossover

be a good swimmer you need an efficient stroke technique. However, many swimmers define an efficient stroke to be one that has low levels of drag; whilst this is partly the case it is a long way from the full story and trying to lower their drag at all costs has led many swimmers down a blind alley with their stroke technique. An efficient freestyle stroke is one that has both low levels of drag and high levels of propulsion. Actually, to be strictly correct we mean high levels of propulsive efficiency because any swimmer can generate more propulsion by lifting their work rate but that doesn’t make them more efficient. What we are really interested in is how much forward propulsion you create given how hard you are working physically: if we can increase that propulsive efficiency you will create lots of propulsion from low levels of physical effort and this will lift your overall efficiency dramatically. We could say that: overall efficiency = drag profile × propulsive efficiency --- Page 128 Text --- Let’s consider both of these areas: Low drag is very important to a good stroke technique because water is so dense, 800 times denser than air in fact. Any object moving through water creates drag, which tries to slow it down, but the shape and profile of the object has a large effect on how much drag is created by the water. As a swimmer we are looking to be as streamlined as possible in order to slip easily through it. This means keeping all elements of your stroke as straight and aligned as possible and also keeping your body position (chest- hips-ankles) as horizontal and high in the water as possible. Propulsive efficiency is about creating as much forward propulsion as possible given how

order to slip easily through it. This means keeping all elements of your stroke as straight and aligned as possible and also keeping your body position (chest- hips-ankles) as horizontal and high in the water as possible. Propulsive efficiency is about creating as much forward propulsion as possible given how hard you are working. As discussed earlier in Chapter 9, as an adult swimmer you are aiming to generate most of your propulsion from your arm stroke as it’s much more efficient than your leg kick, i.e. for any level of physical effort, you create more propulsion with your arm stroke than you would with your kick. As we saw in Chapter 13, the key to developing good upper-body propulsion is to press the water backwards with good timing, thus sending you forwards. A poor stroke with poor propulsive efficiency pushes the water to the side, downward or even forwards – this is very hard work and results in much less propulsion. Which is more important, low drag or good propulsion? Neither, they are in fact equally important. If you made a 10% reduction in your drag you would gain the same in overall speed and efficiency as a 10% improvement in propulsive efficiency. In a nutshell, you cannot be a strong swimmer without low drag and good propulsion so you need to work on both areas of your stroke technique. Which should you develop first? Generally speaking we recommend you develop both at the same time but some swimmers already have low drag and need to work more on their propulsion as a priority and vice versa. In the Swim Types section in Chapters 17 to 23 we’ll give you some specific advice on this for your individual swimming. ADAM: A good reason to work on your propulsive technique,

a fast and efficient swimmer. The exact balance you strike between the two will depend on your build, experience, skill level and natural stroke style. Efficiency and Stroke Length In the early 1990s a movement developed in swimming promoting the idea that all swimmers should look to maximise the length of their strokes. This was based on the following observations at the time: 1. Olympic champions often (but not always) have long strokes, taking fewer strokes per length than ‘normal’ swimmers. For instance, freestyle great Alex Popov taking around 31 strokes per 50 m. 2. Slow inefficient swimmers who fight the water have shorter strokes and take more strokes per length than more capable swimmers. The conclusion drawn was that to be efficient you need a long stroke and this should be a priority for all swimmers to develop, regardless of whether they were pool or open water swimmers. Swimmers were taught to lengthen out their strokes as much as possible and try and glide down the pool, with the lead hand held out for an extended time creating a distinct pause between strokes. At Swim Smooth we call this style of stroke ‘Overgliding’. Unfortunately this approach was a very over-simplified view of swimming technique and did not take into account the true facts: 1. Many other Olympic champions use a shorter faster stroke very effectively if it suits their natural style. For instance Janet Evans and Laure Manadou taking around 50 strokes per 50 m. These swimmers are examples of the refined Swinger style (see Chapter 22). 2. Great swimmers that were observed with long strokes were not achieving their stroke length through gliding, they were achieving it through low drag and great propulsion (see below). Video analysis of these swimmers shows that the gap between one stroke finishing

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
the last way, gliding, is that it is an artificial way to lengthen the stroke and does not make you more efficient for three major reasons: 1. Whilst overgliding you decelerate in the water and then have to re-accelerate on the next stroke, which is hard work. 2. This is a technical one: for a fixed swimming speed, by introducing gliding you have a higher peak speed as you accelerate and decelerate more on every stroke. Because drag in water is very non-linear, the higher peak speed creates a very high level of drag, creating more drag overall than a swimmer moving at a more constant speed. 3. An overglide kills the rhythm in your stroke, which is very unnatural for the body as it prefers to operate in a much more continuous fluid way. 4. An overgliding stroke is very inefficient in open water where waves and chop easily stall you in the long gap between strokes. The inefficiency of artificially lowering stroke rate was confirmed in a fascinating study in 2010 carried out by the Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas [3], which demonstrated the inefficiency of lowering stroke rates in the pursuit of an overly long freestyle stroke. The study found that heart rate, oxygen consumption and perceived exertion in swimmers was significantly higher at stroke rates 10% to 20% below their natural stroke rate. The researchers also measured kick rate in response to manipulating the swimmer’s stroke rate between ±20% of their natural baseline and determined the higher work rate of the swimmers at lower stroke rates was primarily due to the increase in leg kick required to propel the swimmers through the induced dead spot at the front of the stroke. The study also highlighted that there was no significant increase in effort when stroke rate

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
higher work rate of the swimmers at lower stroke rates was primarily due to the increase in leg kick required to propel the swimmers through the induced dead spot at the front of the stroke. The study also highlighted that there was no significant increase in effort when stroke rate was elevated by up to 20% above their natural baseline and that the swimmers were able to reduce kicking intensity at these more rhythmical tempos. This study clearly demonstrates that at fixed swimming speed: 1. Artificially lengthening the stroke reduces efficiency. 2. Stroke rate can be lifted by at least 20% above natural stroke rate without a loss of efficiency. The latter conclusion is interesting because it highlights the ‘headroom’ that swimmers have to lift their stroke rates to help them punch through waves and chop in open water, offering them a huge advantage in the process. Swim-Golf or ‘SWOLF’ Score --- Page 131 Text --- A common test used by coaches is the ‘Swim-Golf’ or ‘SWOLF’ test – SWOLF being an abbreviation of Swim-Golf. Here the swimmer is timed over a short distance (e.g. 100 m) and counts their strokes at the same time. They then add the number of strokes taken to the time in seconds to come up with an overall score. For instance, a swimmer taking 110 seconds for 100 m and taking 90 strokes has a score of 200. The swimmer is then challenged to repeat the swim and lower the score, either by swimming quicker with the same number of strokes taken or by taking fewer strokes at the same speed. The idea being to use a longer stroke and therefore become more efficient. If you have been swimming for a while yourself you have probably tried this test at some point. At Swim

quicker with the same number of strokes taken or by taking fewer strokes at the same speed. The idea being to use a longer stroke and therefore become more efficient. If you have been swimming for a while yourself you have probably tried this test at some point. At Swim Smooth we dislike using Swim-Golf tests because they encourage swimmers to add glide to their strokes and to kick hard to artificially lengthen them. They also encourage swimmers to simply increase their effort by pushing harder on every stroke to take them further on each stroke. PAUL: When I am coaching I very rarely encourage swimmers to count their strokes or perform Swim-Golf tests. To create a more efficient stroke we need to improve a swimmer’s technique by lowering their drag or increasing their propulsive efficiency. The end result is a longer stroke without the swimmer consciously chasing it. Putting the cart before the horse and making the objective a long stroke only encourages swimmers to over-glide and so ironically become less, not more, efficient. Stroke Length and Stroke Style As we will discover in the Swim Types section of this book, there are two distinct styles of stroke used by elite swimmers to great effect. The first is the ‘Smooth’ style which is what most of us think of as an efficient stroke, being long and silky smooth but still – vitally – maintaining good stroke rhythm. The second is the ‘Refined Swinger’ style, which is a shorter more punchy style of stroke with a higher stroke rate. Both of these styles are very efficient. In fact the longer-smoother style tends to be used by sprinters and middle distance athletes whilst the Swinger style is used predominantly by distance swimmers from 800 m and up, especially in the open

Note 1 These efficiency plots are based on the 2.0–2.2 power relationship between velocity and drag at sub 1.4 m / s swimming speed [1]. Above this speed drag increases even more rapidly as wave drag becomes dominant [1]. The plots assume a constant propulsive efficiency for each swimmer across their effort range. In practise propulsive efficiency is known to increase with effort level, which will slightly steepen the relationships shown on the plots. To date no research has quantified this increase and so it is assumed fixed for the purposes of this analysis. --- Page 133 Text --- CHAPTER 16 Performing Your Own Video Analysis Session PAUL: Isn’t technology wonderful? I first started using a Sony digital video camera back in 1997 as an easy way to communicate with the swimmer what they were doing in the water and how they might improve their stroke technique. Being able to see what they were doing whilst I simultaneously analysed their stroke had a profound benefit that simple poolside demonstrations could never replicate. I vividly recall as a 12-year-old my squad coach telling me that he would bring his huge 1980s Betacam system down to the pool to film me and show me how I might refine my stroke but alas this never happened. However, the idea was sown and as soon as I

the thinking behind the system and how it was created: --- Page 143 Text --- PAUL: Coming from a competitive swimming background as a kid growing up in the UK, I always found it fascinating to see how different body types and builds gravitated towards each of the four competitive strokes – butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle. The tallest swimmers with great hip flexibility tended to excel at breaststroke; the tall, muscular swimmers with great kicks were strong in the freestyle and backstroke sprint events; and the shorter, stockier swimmers with good upper-body flexibility tended to be good at butterfly. Being a little vertically challenged myself (compared to some of my giant-like rivals!) my best events were the 100 m and 200 m butterfly and the longer distance freestyle events. I could not seem to sprint like the other guys no matter how much speed work I put in but ask me to move along at a moderately fast pace and maintain this for repetition after repetition, well that I could do! Still, there were no prizes for being good at training or having a good work ethic – all that counted was who was first to the touch pads. Proudly representing Bridlington Swimming Club aged 9 (centre) I couldn’t change my growth rate or the size of my feet but swimming would have been a lot less frustrating had I been shown how genetics potentially predisposed me to one stroke or distance of event over another. I certainly wouldn’t have kept trying to become a super-quick 50 m freestyle specialist against my 1.9 m / 6′ 4″ rivals! What’s more, the recommended stroke style and technique that worked for these guys just didn’t seem to work for me. As a junior I was told by my coaches that my

have kept trying to become a super-quick 50 m freestyle specialist against my 1.9 m / 6′ 4″ rivals! What’s more, the recommended stroke style and technique that worked for these guys just didn’t seem to work for me. As a junior I was told by my coaches that my stroke didn’t look that pretty and I was often affectionately known as ‘Steam Boat Willie’ by my friends because of my high stroke rate and a punchy style. Unfortunately, open water swimming wasn’t very popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s and at 10 or 11 years of age, very rarely would we be encouraged to swim more than 400 m freestyle at a meet. This is a shame given what we now know about the differences in swimming style and suitability towards different environments and distances. Unfortunately I didn’t progress beyond county (state) representative level in the pool. However I did switch to triathlon at the age of 16 and instantly felt at home, revelling in the new open water environment with my aerobic engine and high revving stroke. I was much more suited to the longer distances in rougher water than to the 50 m or 100 m dash in the pool, and went on to represent Great Britain in triathlon as a Junior and Under-23 between the years of 1997 and 2001. Being one of the fastest swimmers in the field was fantastic and I was thankful for both my swimming background and for being persistent enough to stick with the sport when many of my fellow swimmers ‘retired’ in their mid-teens.

optimal style for her, as did Olympic Champion Janet Evans before her and Laure Manadou, David Davies and Lotte Friis (all Olympic Medallists) have done since. Meeting Shelley and seeing her in action was mind-blowing and I was seeing more and more that the consensus in swimming was wrong and there was more than one type of fast and efficient freestyle stroke. Whilst everything in the printed media and online at this time was still saying ‘longer strokes are always better’, in practice I was finding that whilst this would work for some, for others this advice was proving totally detrimental if they simply didn’t have the physical height and strength to make it work for them. In pursuing a very long stroke, these swimmers were creating as many problems in their technique as they were solving. I coined the phrase ‘Overglider’ as far back as 2004 after seeing so many swimmers introducing a --- Page 146 Text --- long glide to their stroke to try and lengthen it out as much as possible. These swimmers had pretty good alignment and body position but were stuck on a performance plateau whilst in pursuit of an ever-longer stroke. With my sports-science background I respect the fact that research and evidence was needed to test hypothesis and the evidence was stacking up here against the ‘longer is more efficient’ world view. Thinking back to my own swimming, a long stroke would have been great for the 1.9 m tall giants with powerful kicks to push them through the gap between strokes but I was neither tall nor was I very good at kick! Nor were many of the swimmers that I was coaching and most were training for open water swimming and triathlon where the conditions are much bumpier from swimming in

kicks to push them through the gap between strokes but I was neither tall nor was I very good at kick! Nor were many of the swimmers that I was coaching and most were training for open water swimming and triathlon where the conditions are much bumpier from swimming in close proximity to other swimmers. One key thing that my sports-science degree taught me was that specificity in training is essential. It’s OK to use models of efficiency as a starting point (e.g. our Mr. Smooth animation) but you must have the ability to adapt your stroke to the environment in which you are swimming and, equally, to find a stroke that works for you given your own experience, physical makeup and even your personality. One of my old coaches at university used to say ‘all swimmer’s strokes are like fingerprints, no two are the same’ and whilst this is true, I was also starting to appreciate how many of these stroke flaws and movement patterns were clustering into ‘types’ of swimmer. Stronger athletes with limited swimming backgrounds would attack the water like they would the rugby field but would be held back by low sinking legs in the water. Some swimmers would have a strong kick and great body position but slip to the back of the lane when using a pull buoy. The more studious and analytical swimmers could tell me exactly what they should be doing in the water from all their research but then be unable to put this into practice. I could personally identify with another group of swimmers who had a strong swimming background but had developed a complex about the tidiness of their strokes and inability to kick (and sprint!). It was very obvious to me that all these types of swimmer should

to put this into practice. I could personally identify with another group of swimmers who had a strong swimming background but had developed a complex about the tidiness of their strokes and inability to kick (and sprint!). It was very obvious to me that all these types of swimmer should be developed and worked with differently. If we could classify them and provide each ‘Swim Type’ with their own individual pathway for developing their strokes then all swimmers would develop at an optimal rate and into a style of stroke best suited to their makeup. We would be able to move away from a cookie-cutter programme that only works for the lucky few. Working with the other Swim Smooth coaches and sharing experiences and ideas, I formulated this into the full Swim Types system in 2007–08. We used and refined the system and stroke correction processes for a further two years before launching it to the world on www.swimtypes.com in June 2010. I was very excited about the potential of Swim Types but also aware that the system needed to be extremely well thought through and as fool-proof as possible before launching it. After developing the stroke-style aspect of Swim Types, the area that fascinated me most was how each of the types tended to have a distinct personality. As a coach, one of the most important things I have learned over the last 15 years is that communication and the way you give direction to an athlete is just as important as what you actually say. I have met a wide range of swimmers over the years: some are very direct and want straight-forward answers with no ‘fluff’, some crave a detailed scientific explanation, some seek minimal guidance but want assistance with motivation and others respond best to a

as you browse through the information of each Swim Type, read the profiles and watch the video clips on our website. I’m absolutely sure you’ll start to recognise swimmers that you know, both in how they swim but also in their personalities. Since we launched the system we’ve spoken to many swimming coaches around the world who have told us how they often think about swimmers in types themselves, albeit without having put a proper system around it. If you’ve already been thinking along these lines yourself, you’ll find it fascinating how we’ve recognised swimmer personality and the ‘two ideal stroke types’ concept in the system. I hope Swim Types gives you new ideas and thoughts for your own coaching and gives you the confidence to step outside the ‘one size fits all’ approach we’ve all been conditioned to use for the last 20 years. Two ‘Ideal’ Swim Types The Swim Type system covers six types of swimmer which we’ve given caricature names: Arnie, Bambino, Kicktastic, Overglider, Swinger and Smooth. The Smooth type is the long stroke style that everyone traditionally thinks of as being fast and efficient. To see an Olympic level Smooth in the flesh is awe inspiring as they slip through the water with grace and purpose. However, a fascinating aspect of the Swim Type system is that it recognises a second stroke style as also being ‘ideal’. The Swinger – in its refined form – is an exceptionally fast and efficient stroke style too and is often used by elite swimmers and triathletes to great effect. It’s a shorter, punchier style that’s won many Olympic Gold Medals in the pool, but in rougher open water its natural emphasis on stroke rhythm makes it completely dominant and is used by a significant majority of elite swimmers in

which you are going to swim. Identifying Your Swim Type --- Page 148 Text --- We are sure you are dying to discover your own Swim Type! There are three ways to do this: By reading the profiles of each type in Chapters 18–23; the chances are you will immediately identify with the experiences and personality of one of the types! Using the Swim Type Questionnaire at: www.swimtypes.com/yourtype – this is great fun but be aware that it is not entirely fool-proof and sometimes misdiagnoses your type, it is best used in conjunction with the Swim Type profiles. Using the observation sheet at: www.swimtypes.com/observation – this is particularly useful if you are a coach observing swimmers in the pool. Swim Type Statistics Since we launched the Swim Type system in 2010 we have been collecting statistics from the questionnaire on the website (www.swimtypes.com) and also from sales of the Swim Type Stroke Correction Guides. From this we’re able to gauge the percentage split of each Swim Type: ADAM: The most interesting of these statistics to me is the sheer quantity of Overgliders out there! On the Swim Smooth blog and website we talk a lot about the problems of adding too much glide into freestyle and the dead spot it creates. Now you can see why – overgliding has reached epidemic proportions in the swimming world! Sales of Swim Type Guide by type. The Gender Divide The gender divide amongst the Swim Types is clear to see below with men much more likely to be Arnies and Overgliders, and women much more likely to be Bambinos and Kicktastics.

Split of Swim Type Guides by Gender from website sales. Swim Type ‘Cross-Breeds’ The Swim Types describe the six classic ways that people swim. At Swim Smooth we refer to someone who fits their type perfectly as a ‘classic Overglider’ or ‘classic Arnie’. However it would be an exaggeration to say that all swimmers fit a type perfectly. Generally speaking the more coaching a swimmer has had, the more they move towards another Swim Type and many of these swimmers are mid-way between two types. The most common cross-breed is the Arnie-Overglider. Many Arnies become very frustrated with their swimming and follow common advice to lengthen out their strokes as much as possible by introducing a significant glide. They may still have a poor body position in the water and a tendency to cross over in front of the head, which are relics from their pure-Arnie days. Another common cross-type is the Bambino-Kicktastic. These are normally Bambinos who never really get to grips with arm propulsion and start to over-kick to compensate. Lastly, the Kicktastic-Smooth can be seen in the fast lane of many squads. These can either be Kicktastics who have a reasonable catch technique and

Another common cross-type is the Bambino-Kicktastic. These are normally Bambinos who never really get to grips with arm propulsion and start to over-kick to compensate. Lastly, the Kicktastic-Smooth can be seen in the fast lane of many squads. These can either be Kicktastics who have a reasonable catch technique and are on their way to being pure-Smooths or Smooths who have lost some of their feel for the water since their competition days and are over-kicking to compensate. --- OCR from Page 149 Image 1 --- Arnie Bambino Kicktastic Overglider Swinger Smooth Female --- Page 150 Text --- If you feel that you are a bit of a cross-breed caught between two types then start off by following the stroke development process for the type from which you originally came. For instance, in the case of the Arnie-Overglider you should follow the Arnie guide first and if you still feel Overglider tendencies then follow the Overglider process afterwards. The Swim Types Website Swim Smooth operates a dedicated website about the Swim Types system which will also be a very useful resource to you at www.swimtypes.com. You’ll find video clips of each Swim Type and also a questionnaire that you can complete to assess your own swimming. The website also sells a full training and development guide of approximately 20 pages in length for each Swim Type. This takes you through each step of your swimming development in greater detail than is possible in this book and shows you the exact steps you need to improve your swimming. If you find the Swim Type system useful for the development of your swimming you will find one of these detailed guides a very useful supplement to the development process provided in this book.

steps you need to improve your swimming. If you find the Swim Type system useful for the development of your swimming you will find one of these detailed guides a very useful supplement to the development process provided in this book. Swim Type Personalities Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the Swim Types system is how each type tends towards distinct character traits. Whilst not set in stone, if you recognise your personality in the following Swim Type profiles then you’re really quite likely to swim with that distinct style. ADAM: As a coach, when meeting a swimmer for the first time it’s always good practice to chat to them about their goals and their swimming experiences. This chat, and the insight it offers into their personality, is often enough to have a very good guess about their stroke style using the Swim Type system – more often than not these educated guesses turn out to be correct! The classic Swim Type personalities are: Arnie: Driven and competitive, anxious to get on with things and progress. Arnies are normally talented athletes on land and so find swimming very frustrating. Sometimes this frustration is very apparent and bubbling away just beneath the surface, in fact Arnies often do not enjoy swimming and many treat it is a necessary evil for triathlon. Bambino: Normally quite anxious and occasionally positively frightened in water. A Bambino’s goals are likely to be about health, personal achievement and fulfilment rather than competitive placings. Open and receptive to coaching, they feel very rewarded by every small improvement in their swimming. Kicktastic: Often quiet and self sufficient, Kicktastics can appear a little disinterested or aloof to their fellow swimmers. Underneath the surface they are as keen to improve as any other swimmer but are susceptible to becoming bored

to coaching, they feel very rewarded by every small improvement in their swimming. Kicktastic: Often quiet and self sufficient, Kicktastics can appear a little disinterested or aloof to their fellow swimmers. Underneath the surface they are as keen to improve as any other swimmer but are susceptible to becoming bored while swimming and need a variety of stimuli to maintain focus. --- Page 151 Text --- Overglider: Thoughtful and analytical, this is the swimmer who’s read all the books on swimming and studied all the Youtube videos. Loves to record and analyse data and can normally tell you their times and stroke counts off the top of their heads. Love to use their intellect to improve their swimming but may be susceptible to over-thinking! Swinger: These guys just love to swim! So much so that they often dislike technique work as they feel it interrupts the flow of their session. Normally the first to arrive on the pool deck for a squad session and impatient to get in the water and get on with it. Outgoing and social, these guys are not afraid to wear bright bathers! Smooth: Quiet but with an inner self-confidence, these guys know their place in the pool – at the front of the fast lane! However, after many years of training they can feel uninspired – they know they have the ability to be very quick but sometimes lack motivation to train. --- Page 152 Text --- CHAPTER 18 The Arnie Arnies are normally male but female Arnies do exist, we affectionately refer to them as ‘Arnettes’. At their heart Arnies have a competitive personality across all walks of life, they tend to be naturally athletic and normally excel at sports. For this reason it can come as a bit of a shock that they

but female Arnies do exist, we affectionately refer to them as ‘Arnettes’. At their heart Arnies have a competitive personality across all walks of life, they tend to be naturally athletic and normally excel at sports. For this reason it can come as a bit of a shock that they don’t take to swimming nearly as well; this combined with a driven personality and high expectations can lead to a lot of frustration! PAUL: When I’m talking to an Arnie the most common thing they will tell me is ‘I just don’t understand it, I’m much fitter than these other people and yet they can swim much faster! I have run marathons and yet can’t even swim a length of freestyle!’. This frustration is nearly always present with Arnies and in some extreme cases bubbling away just beneath the surface ready to boil over. Our cartoon caricature of the Arnie is overtly muscular and whilst this is a bit of fun to emphasise the point, many Arnies do have a strong build with lots of muscle bulk. Don’t be distracted by this though, many other Arnies are less heavily built but nearly all have lean (and so ‘sinky’) muscle mass, which has a direct impact on their swimming. The female Arnette is not bulky but they’re athletic and competitive at land- based sports, just as their male counterparts. the arine --- Page 153 Text --- The Arnie displays a wide variety of stroke flaws in one package and is the classic swimmer we think of who fights the water. A lifting head to breathe, crossing over in front of the head, scissor kicks, kicking from the knee and a low body position are all very much in evidence. If you are an Arnie this may sound like a bad situation

classic swimmer we think of who fights the water. A lifting head to breathe, crossing over in front of the head, scissor kicks, kicking from the knee and a low body position are all very much in evidence. If you are an Arnie this may sound like a bad situation to be in but the positive is that innate athleticism of yours. If we can improve your stroke technique so that the effort you are putting in is being used effectively then you stand to make some major strides forwards from where you are now. In terms of pace, classic Arnies swim 1:50 to 3:00 / 100 m for continuous swimming but can normally sprint considerably quicker for short distances. As Arnies develop their strokes they can become quicker than 1:50 / 100 m, albeit they will still be held back by their low body position in the water. See Arnie video clips at: www.swimtypes.com/arnie The classic Arnie with low-lying legs in the water. --- OCR from Page 153 Image 1 --- highly competitive goal-setting personality the classic swimmer who tights the water often frustrated by swimming lean build, sometimes but not always overtly muscular flexibility and range of motion can be poor talented at land-based sports but finds swimming surprisingly hard needs to learn better pace judgement legs tend to lie good natural low in the water resulting sprint ability in high drag --- Page 154 Text --- Arnie Key Stroke Flaws The single biggest thing holding an Arnie back is their low body position in the water, which is caused by a combination of stroke flaws which each need to be tackled in turn: A strong tendency to hold onto their breath underwater which harms relaxation and creates excess buoyancy in the chest, lifting the front end up

not strictly stroke technique, Arnies are also the worst culprits when it comes to poor pacing with a real tendency to start a swim or training set too fast and then blow up and slow down dramatically. Developing a good sense of pace awareness and control is a critical skill for any swimmer trying to reach their potential. For more information on this see Chapter 28. For the full Arnie stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 156 Text --- CHAPTER 19 The Bambino Bambinos are often but not always female and would love to be good at swimming, perhaps not in an overtly competitive way but from a healthy self-fulfilling perspective. Fundamentally, Bambinos lack confidence in the water and this is reflected in their stroke style, which lacks positivity and ‘oomph’. ADAM: If you are a Bambino then don’t fear, we’ll show you how to tune up your stroke technique and build up your confidence in your swimming. A good positive attitude will go a long way in helping with this; be positive in your thoughts and never put yourself down – you deserve much better than that! Bambinos are normally in the speed range between 2:00 and 3:00 per 100 m. A classic Bambino may struggle to complete 25 m of freestyle as they feel like they’re sinking and struggle to breathe. Even as they develop their swimming fitness, many have to stop every length to catch their breath. In terms of developing their strokes, Bambinos defy conventional logic. They only respond slightly to balance and streamlining exercises (the approach for an Arnie for instance) but make much larger improvements by working on their catch and stroke rate, which is traditionally left to more advanced swimmers. This is because they have such poor feel for the water

conventional logic. They only respond slightly to balance and streamlining exercises (the approach for an Arnie for instance) but make much larger improvements by working on their catch and stroke rate, which is traditionally left to more advanced swimmers. This is because they have such poor feel for the water and are so lacking in rhythm that they find it very hard to progress without some attention in these areas first. --- Page 157 Text --- the bambino Many Bambinos are quite short with small hands and short arms. This means that a long gliding stroke style is unlikely to work well for them. If you are a Bambino be very wary of adding a glide into your stroke as more than any other type you are vulnerable to the inefficiencies of doing so. A faster stroke rate style with more ‘oomph’ will work for you much more effectively. PAUL: If you can find a nice friendly swim group or squad we highly recommend that you join their sessions. Whilst you won’t be the fastest swimmer there, having other swimmers around you will push you along and help you achieve things you didn’t know you could do! This really will do wonders for your confidence and give you a real buzz of achievement!

This is a contributing factor to a Bambino’s anxiety in the water. A slow stroke that lacks rhythm and ‘oomph’. The more anxious a Bambino is in the water, the less positivity there is in their stroke movements. A poor ‘feel for the water’ where the arms slip through with very little purchase or propulsion. Like Arnies, Bambinos often kick from the knee with a jittery action, which creates a lot of drag and pulls the body low in the water. --- Page 159 Text --- A tendency to cross over in front of the head, which further reduces ‘feel for the water’. This poor feel means that the lead hand collapses down when breathing offering very little support.

At the very fast end there is a crossover with the Smooth Swim Type who also use a propulsive 6-beat kick, albeit with extremely good arm propulsion too! For obvious reasons Kicktastics dislike swimming with a pull buoy (with no leg kick) and are normally significantly slower with one than without.

own swimming, in the stroke development section we’ll show you a stroke adaptation you can make to improve your wetsuit swimming. The personality of a classic Kicktastic is one of the most fascinating: often quiet and reserved, Kicktastics seem to shy away from attention or standing out from the crowd — they seem to be quite happy slipping under the radar and going their own way with their swimming. However, underneath the surface they are extremely keen swimmers and are as anxious to improve as any of the other Swim Types. They also seem to get bored quite easily in swim sets and benefit from a lot of variety and mini- challenges to keep things interesting. Tall Male Kicktastics A little harder to spot than most Kicktastics is the tall male variety. Rather than using a very rapid kick, these swimmers often employ a slower kick, but with a larger amplitude up and down. Although apparently less vigorous, their kick is still very dominant in their stroke and extremely energy-sapping. Their kick may also surge a little more than conventional Kicktastics, a typical rhythm being four hard kicks and then two easy. See Kicktastic video clips at: www.swimtypes.com/kicktastic Kicktastic Key Stroke Flaws The Kicktastic’s dominant leg kick comes from a lack of catch and ‘feel for the water’ at the front of their stroke. By improving your catch the leg kick will naturally drop down to a balanced level with the arm stroke. We’re not looking to kill your kick, just bring it under control. Kicktastics have a strong tendency to pull through underwater with a straight arm. A very strong energy-sapping leg kick. Slower Kicktastics may kick excessively from the knee, which produces less propulsion and more drag. Poor catch and ‘feel for the water’, normally pushing down on

internet. In nearly every case they have latched on to the idea that, to be an efficient swimmer, the freestyle stroke should be long with minimum strokes taken per length. Above the water they can look smooth and relaxed but under the water we see why they are not as efficient (or quick) as they would like to be. Unfortunately Overgliders have taken the idea of a long freestyle stroke a little too far to the point where they’ve added a significant glide-phase to their stroke at the front end. Some even report that they like the ‘rest’ time between strokes without realising the significant deceleration in the momentum of the stroke that this causes. This stop-pause-and-do-nothing rhythm is inefficient because the swimmer slows down significantly between strokes and then has to re-accelerate on the next stroke. In an effort to lengthen out, many Overgliders also drop the elbow and wrist and show the palm of the hand forwards. This harms the catch phase to follow and creates a lot of drag in its own right — we call it ‘putting on the brakes’. ADAM: I admit it, I used to be an Overglider before I joined Swim Smooth! One of the fascinating things about the Swim Type system is the correlation between stroke styles and personality. Here’s an interesting one: nearly all Overgliders work in technical professions such as engineering or IT. What did I used to do before joining Swim Smooth? Funnily enough I was an engineer — doh! --- Page 166 Text --- An overglide in the stroke creates an additional problem, it slows the stroke rate right down and causes the swimmer to lose touch with their rhythm and timing.

doh! --- Page 166 Text --- An overglide in the stroke creates an additional problem, it slows the stroke rate right down and causes the swimmer to lose touch with their rhythm and timing. The freestyle stroke should be smooth and continuous, moving seamlessly from one phase to another. A dead spot and pause interrupts this rhythm, which quickly becomes imprinted in the stroke timing and can be as hard to remove, or harder, than other stroke flaws. This is ironic as many Overgliders are trying to avoid imprinting bad stroke habits by swimming correctly at all times. A typical Overglider learns freestyle as an adult and makes good initial progress as they diligently improve their body position and rotation in the water. However, they quite quickly reach a speed and efficiency plateau which they can’t seem to break through. The speed at which they can swim is normally heavily dependant on their height and arm length with many taller Overgliders reaching around 1:40 per 100 m and shorter swimmers around 2:00 per 100 m before hitting a plateau. Overgliders often realise they need to lift their tempo and stroke rate to improve their swimming but when they try to do so they keep the glide in place in their stroke and speed up every other movement. If you’ve tried this yourself you will know it is very hard work, a little like driving down the freeway with the handbrake on! Instead, the key is to remove the glide by improving your catch technique, this naturally lifts up the stroke rate while keeping all other movements at the same speed. When you learn to coordinate a better catch and remove the glide, you will gain a significant increase in speed for little, if any, increase in effort. The classic Overglider:

Unfortunately this goes against the principal of specificity in training (see Chapter 24) and the resultant de-training can see many of these swimmers becoming slower in their races. If you have neglected your swimming fitness then you stand to make some large gains in speed from getting back into some training using Chapter 27

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
so slow that it’s too long between breaths to breathe every three strokes. Over time breathing to one side develops a lopsided stroke with a lack of symmetry, this is particularly a problem for open water swimming where it can cause the swimmer to track off course constantly. After the long glide phase, Overgliders literally have to kick-start their strokes with a large knee-driven kick. --- Page 169 Text --- A pulsing kick is often used to kick-start the stroke again after the long glide phase. To create the required impetus to restart the stroke the knee is often bent too far during the kick, creating drag and harming the swimmer’s body rotation. A light flutter kick is normally much more appropriate for Overgliders as it keeps the body position high and helps maintain stroke rhythm. For the full Overglider stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 170 Text --- CHAPTER 22 The Swinger --- Page 171 Text --- PAUL: If I told you about a swimmer who takes around 50 to 52 strokes per 50 m lap of the pool it’s unlikely you’d be very impressed, you might think they couldn’t be a very good swimmer — they should be taking far fewer strokes per length than that. But what if I told you that swimmer was Frenchwoman Laure Manadou who won Olympic Gold in the 400 m freestyle at the 2004 Athens Olympics and also held the world records at 200 m and 400 m? Laure and swimmers like her defy the conventional swimming logic that you must always swim with a long stroke in order to be efficient. Here lies the Swinger: fast and efficient but unappreciated and unloved — until now! See Laure swim here: www.swimsmooth.com/manadou Swingers are nearly always experienced swimmers with many years

now get to see the beautiful part of their stroke: under the water. Here a refined Swinger’s stroke mechanics are poetry in motion: a great catch and perfect rhythm and timing all working together in perfect harmony! In terms of speed, Swingers cover a very large range depending on the level of refinement in their strokes. Unrefined Swingers may swim 1:45 / 100 m, while an elite level Swinger with a refined stroke can swim sub 1:00 / 100 m pace — matching Smooth types over distances of 400 m and over. Swingers have a natural disposition towards distance swimming and normally dislike sprint training. Their personality is very go-getting and they like to get on with things without waiting around or thinking about it too much! Swimming legend Shelley Taylor-Smith shows the refined Swinger style: bent elbow catch underwater and the recovering arm swinging around the side. --- OCR from Page 172 Image 1 --- experienced swimmer, normally with a competitive swimming background a fast choppy stroke style that oozes rhythm many elite swimmers are swingers, particularly open water swimmers and professional triathletes a natural disposition to distance swimming and dislikes sprinting most commonly found in Masters swim squads may have received unfavourable comments about their stroke in the past in comparison to smoother swimmers outgoing go-getting personality possibly lacking a litte patience hates kick sets often found in unrefined form with crossovers and a poor catch faster stroke rate style naturally suits a 2-beat kick classic swingers love to get on and swim with minimum stoppages or distractions such as drills likes to wear bright bathers! --- Page 173 Text --- Whilst there are examples of Swingers performing well with a 6-beat kick, a classic Swinger really comes into their own with a 2-beat kick.

to get on and swim with minimum stoppages or distractions such as drills likes to wear bright bathers! --- Page 173 Text --- Whilst there are examples of Swingers performing well with a 6-beat kick, a classic Swinger really comes into their own with a 2-beat kick. A refined Swinger uses their kick with great timing, using it to drive their body rotation from one side to the other, which in turn drives the arm stroke. Whilst they may not achieve much propulsion directly from their kick, they use it to drive the arm stroke which is a much more efficient use of the kick effort. To achieve really high stroke rates a Swinger needs to use a 2-beat kick, a 6-beat kick simply becomes too rapid at these stroke rates to keep up with (see Chapter 9 on the various kicking styles). PAUL: When I ask an Overglider what they think of when they swim, they can list off several parts of their stroke they are thinking about at any one time! But ask a Swinger the same question and you tend to get a blank look or an answer like ‘nothing really!’. A Swinger’s ability (and preference) to switch off their brain and just swim is a strength in many ways. Focused stroke technique development has an important place in swimming (and Swingers may well be guilty of skipping over this part of their preparation) but at other times it’s very important to stop analysing and just swim, which is when the Swinger’s ‘stop talking and let me get on with it’ personality really comes into its own! Unrefined Swingers may have stroke faults such as crossovers, scissor kicks and a hurried catch but the fundamental punch and rhythm is always in place. If you are a Swinger

which is when the Swinger’s ‘stop talking and let me get on with it’ personality really comes into its own! Unrefined Swingers may have stroke faults such as crossovers, scissor kicks and a hurried catch but the fundamental punch and rhythm is always in place. If you are a Swinger whose stroke has become a little ragged over the years you need to take some time out to work on some refinements in your stroke technique. You’ll polish up quite quickly and will soon be back to what you love best — swimming long sets and swimming them fast! Swingers and Open Water Swimming Open water swimming is a natural strength of Swingers and they really become a dominant force in this environment. Their faster stroke rate style helps punch through chop and wake from other swimmers and the longer distance races suit their natural disposition towards endurance events. Where they may lose out to some talented swimmers with long smooth strokes in the pool, they are able to turn the tables on them in open water. Becoming a Swinger In many ways there are two types of Swinger, those who naturally adopt this style (‘classic Swingers’) and those who have developed their strokes towards this style out of necessity. Many swimmers who are short in height or with short arms are forced to use a shorter faster stroke style to swim quickly and efficiently, and so gravitate towards the Swinger style as they develop their strokes. Others are looking to race well in longer distance open water events or triathlon, so even though they are capable of swimming with the Smooth style they choose to adopt the Swinger route to be more efficient in this environment. Very often such swimmers are able to switch between the two stroke styles

The Smooth Swim Type is what everybody thinks of when they imagine a long efficient stroke style. They are the envy of the pool with their relaxed style moving them seemingly effortlessly through the water accompanied by a 6-beat kick. They are strong technically in all areas with great turns and starts, and they are normally competitive at backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly as well as freestyle. Most elite pool swimmers are Smooths, with all time greats such as Ian Thorpe and Alexander Popov typifying this category. Although many observers believe this style of stroke is very efficient and therefore well suited to distance swimming, in practice the opposite is true, most elite Smooths excel as sprinters and middle distance (200 m / 400 m) freestylers. Nearly all Smooths have a significant childhood swimming background, very few adults have been able to develop their strokes to this level without such a background, although it is possible. Smooths are talented athletes with excellent technical skills, coordination and awareness of their body movements in the water. When making modifications to their stroke Smooths are able to do so quickly and easily once they understand what they need to do. The Smooth stroke style is certainly efficient but that does not make it ‘effortless’ as many other swimmers might believe. A Smooth will tell you how hard they are actually working when they swim, it’s their huge control and technical ability that makes the stroke appear effortless from the outside. Think of their movements as being like those of an Olympic gymnast or ballet dancer — they have tremendous grace and poise but to do so they are using strength and control. --- Page 177 Text --- Olympian Jono Van Hazel shows us his classical high elbow recovery.

as being like those of an Olympic gymnast or ballet dancer — they have tremendous grace and poise but to do so they are using strength and control. --- Page 177 Text --- Olympian Jono Van Hazel shows us his classical high elbow recovery. This is an important distinction to understand as many swimmers aspiring to the Smooth stroke style try and introduce the concept of ‘effortless swimming’ into their own strokes, which results in a slow stroke with poor rhythm and timing — anything but efficient. Although Smooths can look as though they have a slow stroke rate this is an illusion brought about by the sheer speed at which they are moving relative to their stroke rate. Smooths operate in the 65—75 strokes per minute range at a steady pace, 75—85 strokes per minute at race pace and even higher when sprinting 50 m. In contrast most Overgliders (who very much aspire to be Smooths) are swimming at 50 strokes per minute and below, slowed down by the imprinted pause-and-glide in their strokes. --- OCR from Page 177 Image 1 --- accomplished swimmer with a competitve swimming background, only found in the top lane of squads been there, seen it, done it!

A lack of motivation is a common theme for them, and I find the key to inspiring them is to change the environment. Many Smooths have developed severe ‘black-line-fever’ from childhood and dislike hard training in the pool as it brings back too many bad memories! The solution to this is to set yourself some new challenges by moving to the open water — either pure swimming events or by getting into triathlon. As we’ll see later, you might have to make some modifications to your stroke to reach your potential in the great outdoors! As adults, Smooths often suffer from a lack of motivation. Whilst they are normally quiet and modest characters, they are also very confident in their own abilities in the water and they know that if they put the effort back into training they could become an extremely fast swimmer again. This is not an issue, the real question is can they conquer their motivational demons and get inspired again? Smooths and Open Water Compared to Swingers, Smooths have a longer stroke with a slower stroke rate. Whilst they don’t pause and glide in their stroke like an Overglider, this lower stroke rate is still a disadvantage in open water and can cause them to be stalled slightly as they are buffeted by chop and wake

each stroke is slightly easier in itself. As a Smooth you are going to have a nice symmetrical stroke which will help you track straight in open water but developing your drafting, sighting and navigation skills is also going to be critical to take on the open water specialists who are very strong in these areas. As a Smooth transitioning to the open water, you’ll really find the advice in Key 3 very beneficial and hopefully it will add a renewed enthusiasm to your swimming. Smooth Stroke Flaws ADAM: A Smooth’s stroke flaws? You might be thinking this could be a short section! But actually without good coaching feedback since their competitive swimming days a Smooth’s stroke will tend to deteriorate slightly and they probably have one or two small areas of their stroke they need to work on, most commonly their catch technique. You will still look good in the water but might well have started to over-kick to compensate for a slight loss in your arm stroke propulsion. If you have been out of the water for a few years you’ll soon brush up and you may be surprised at how quickly you can swim again, perhaps even breaking some old PBs in the process. Pressing down on the water slightly with a straight arm during the catch is the most common stroke flaw seen with Smooths. You’ll still be generating reasonable propulsion with your arm stroke but pressing downward wastes energy and will harm your stroke’s rhythm. Over-kicking slightly (perhaps becoming a little Kicktastic) is another common flaw with Smooths and is related to that slight deterioration in arm stroke propulsion. When you restore your catch and ‘feel for the water’ to its former glory this leg kick will fall away naturally and you’ll notice the reduced

Over-kicking slightly (perhaps becoming a little Kicktastic) is another common flaw with Smooths and is related to that slight deterioration in arm stroke propulsion. When you restore your catch and ‘feel for the water’ to its former glory this leg kick will fall away naturally and you’ll notice the reduced oxygen demand from a less vigorous kick. --- Page 179 Text --- Michelle is a classic Smooth who’s been out of the water for a while. Her kicking technique and exhalation is still in good order but she’s just overreaching a little and dropping her elbow a touch. This will harm her ‘feel for the water’. A slight overglide with the wrist dropping on arm extension is another common flaw if the Smooth has been trying to emphasise the length of their stroke. With so much literature on the internet focusing on this aspect of swimming technique it’s little wonder some Smooths are influenced by it and introduce a small glide into their stroke timing. Professional triathlete Guy Crawford is a Smooth who needs a little tune-up with his catch technique. He’s about to bend his elbow to catch the water but he needs to do this a little sooner — we should already start to see the elbow bend in this shot. Holding onto your breath is something that is taught to many sprinters, which by definition includes most Smooths! With a powerful sprint kick, the extra buoyancy in the chest does not cause the swimmer’s legs to sink and effective breathing is not critical over sprint distances. However for distance freestyle it’s very important to use a constant smooth exhalation whenever your face is in the water. Late breathing timing is a surprisingly common flaw seen in Smooths.

and effective breathing is not critical over sprint distances. However for distance freestyle it’s very important to use a constant smooth exhalation whenever your face is in the water. Late breathing timing is a surprisingly common flaw seen in Smooths. This occurs where the rotation of the head to breathe is a little late, following after the rotation of the body when it should in fact be simultaneous. This reduces the time available to inhale and makes breathing feel quite hurried — work on fixing this and you’ll notice a major improvement in your level of relaxation. For the full Smooth stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 180 Text --- KEY 2 Training Specific fitness training for swimming --- Page 181 Text --- CHAPTER 24 The Importance of Fitness Training The sport of triathlon has seen a huge boom in the last 10 to 15 years and with it a large influx of people with little or no swimming background taking up the sport for the first time. More recently, open water swimming events have experienced a similar boom allowing those enthusiastic swimmers who have previously been stuck within the confines of their local pool to appreciate the freedom of swimming in some amazing open water locations. Whilst the challenge of training for the three sports of triathlon might be unattainable for those with busy professional and family lives, training for open water swimming is much more achievable and equally rewarding. At Swim Smooth we are passionate about open water swimming and are very excited about the growing number of open water events and challenges available for swimmers around the world. Even if you don’t view yourself as being a super-competitive person and are more interested in achievements and self-fulfilment than competitive placings, you still stand to gain

physiology — if you can improve your fitness so that your threshold (and so CSS) is at a faster speed then you will race quicker in any distance event — even in ultra-distance events such as Ironman and marathon swimming. Other fitness factors such as your outright strength or your ability to sprint play an extremely minor part in distance races in comparison. ADAM: If you remember back to the 11-year-old girl story in the introduction to this book, you will recall how quickly she could swim despite having very low levels of outright strength. Here we have one of the main reasons to explain that — she has excellent aerobic fitness from training very consistently in her swim club. i.e. her CSS pace is high. Always remember that distance swimming performances are not about strength but aerobic fitness — it’s about sustaining a good pace for a long time, not sprinting very quickly over a short distance. You need to develop this aerobic fitness in your swimming muscle groups to become a great distance swimmer and CSS training should play a major role in doing that. Improving your CSS is the key to improving your performance in any distance freestyle event. Training at this pace doesn’t have to be a chore — it’s actually quite good fun! --- Page 198 Text --- PAUL: If you have used a power meter on a bike and read Coggan and Allen’s excellent book ‘Training with Power’ (2006) you will be familiar with using the concept of Functional Threshold Power (FTP) to measure your threshold on the bike in Watts. CSS is the exact same concept but for swimming. In the controlled environment of a swimming pool we don’t need something as fancy as a power meter to measure threshold, it can be

in the air like a ‘posh’ person would walk around. This stops the common mistake of bringing the chin towards the chest, which causes the swimmer to sit up in the water and drop the legs and buttocks down low. Breaststroke — whilst used by many swimmers who cannot swim freestyle, breaststroke is actually the least economic and slowest stroke due to the width of the body cutting through the water during the wide ‘frog’ kick. The reason breaststroke is favoured by many swimmers is because of the ease of lifting the head out of the water to breathe. Coordinating breathing in the freestyle stroke can initially be quite daunting whereas breaststroke is significantly easier and for this reason is a very valid way of becoming accustomed to the water when starting out in swimming. One of the keys to a great backstroke is to make sure your head is pushed back into the water. --- Page 243 Text --- Good breaststrokers often have very good hip flexibility, which helps with the angles required to gain a propulsive kick. The key to a good breaststroke is good coordination between the arms and legs and to aim to reduce the frontal profile by not pulling or kicking too wide. A simple focal point for developing a better breaststroke is to focus on snapping your elbows into your sides as you pull through and then driving your arms forwards in as sleek a motion as you possibly can. Try visualising scooping out a bowl of cake mix with your hands as they pull through to develop this motion! A fast breaststroke uses a snappy arm movement, returning to the front of the stroke as soon as possible.

a lot of fun and it’s personally my favourite session of the week to coach! Age-group triathletes are particularly time poor as they must split their training time between three sports, around a full time job and having a healthy family life too. This shortage of time in the water makes it even more critical to focus on the right things when you are training. If you are a time strapped triathlete looking to improve your swim performances, make sure that you practise your open water skills regularly, ideally at least once a week. ADAM: During every Swim Smooth Clinic we run we ask swimmers if they regularly practise their stroke technique by working on appropriate drills in the pool. Nearly every hand is raised — great! But when asked who practises their open water skills regularly, very few hands go up. This highlights a real imbalance in most swimmers’ approach to the sport — don’t make this mistake yourself! Open Water vs. Pool Swimming A small plea from us: never be sold on the illusion that swimming in the pool is exactly the same as swimming in the open water. The fact is that the two can be incredibly different. The contrast is akin to road cycling on smooth flat asphalt, versus a technically challenging and hilly mountain bike trail. Make a commitment to get better at all of these skills at any time in the season and you’ll be translating and adapting your smooth freestyle pool stroke more efficiently to a variety of conditions in the open water. In the next six chapters we show you how. Just like swimming in the pool? The Indian Ocean was pancake flat before this Ironman swim start. --- Page 251 Text --- Reference 1. Chatard, J.-C., and B.

that those of very lean muscle mass saw the --- Page 263 Text --- biggest gains from drafting, potentially because the elevated speed assisted in their horizontal body position in the water – Arnies take note! How to Draft There are two distinct positions in which you can draft: 1. Directly Behind a Faster Swimmer If you have swum in a busy squad session then this position will be well known to you! The effect of swimming directly behind another swimmer is the reason why many swimmers prefer to swim in second or third place rather than lead the lane. It is significantly easier to swim behind another swimmer and the closer you can get to them the easier it will be. Conversely though, spend too much of your time swimming like this in a squad session and you might not be developing your aerobic capacity to its fullest! The simplest way to draft – directly behind another swimmer. Of the two ways to draft, this is by far the most common to see. Try to get as close as possible to the person in front of you but do not actually touch their feet. This is all too easy to do but will probably annoy them and risk you receiving a sharp retaliatory kick! If you end up pushing down on their feet this will increase their drag and slow them, and ultimately you, down. --- Page 264 Text --- PAUL: When you see elite triathletes and open water swimmers drafting one behind the other they are very skillful at maintaining just the right distance behind the swimmer in front to gain the maximum draft and be the least annoying that they can be to the person in front.

swimmers drafting one behind the other they are very skillful at maintaining just the right distance behind the swimmer in front to gain the maximum draft and be the least annoying that they can be to the person in front. It’s not advantageous to be a nuisance by constantly tapping on the toes of the person in front of you and these elite swimmers know that first-hand, waiting patiently for when they might strike and come around their leader to win the race. One way they do this is by stroking quite wide around the feet of the swimmer in front, thus bringing their head and chest even closer to the leader. This takes quite a bit of courage as a misplaced kick can easily end up knocking them in the jaw! Cyclists in a peloton often use tactics to subtly slow their pace and control their distance to maintain the optimal position by becoming less aerodynamically efficient, i.e. sitting up or moving out into the wind momentarily. Elite swimmers might adopt similar tactics by applying the brakes with the lead hand in the same manner that an Overglider might unwittingly do when trying to really lengthen out. The elite swimmer uses this to slow their pace though, whereas the Overglider will feel that they are gliding more and incorrectly assume that they are becoming more efficient as a result. This is just another example of how perception and feel can be quite different to what is happening in reality. ADAM: The other Swim Smooth coaches and I refer to something called the ‘Lane 1 Magneto Effect’. This is where the lane one swimmers in our squads gravitate towards each other despite us setting them off at 5 or 10 second intervals. Normally within 100 m-200 m of any set

we lowered Kate’s swim time from 61 minutes to 53 minutes. How did we do this? Technically Kate swims very well in the open water without a wetsuit but as soon as she put on her suit she felt like she was going backwards. We took a close look at why this was happening. Working with Kate in the pool in Perth. With our Swim Types system we identify the ‘Kicktastic’ swimmer who typically suffers in a wetsuit from this loss of balance; as the name suggests these swimmers like to use a strong 6-beat leg kick but wetsuits tend to bring them so high at the rear they start to kick into thin air. We identified Kate as a bit of a Kicktastic through listening to the issues that she found she was experiencing during racing. Some Overgliders who have adopted a very low head position report this same unbalanced sensation in a wetsuit. Kate has a super high body position in the water, especially in her wetsuit. She can easily afford to use a forward-looking head position with her stroke. If like Kate you feel unbalanced or too high at the rear in your wetsuit it is doubtful that you are actually slower in it; much more likely is that you gain less from a suit than other swimmers you train with and so end up looking slower relative to them. The only way to be sure is to perform a time trial with and without the --- Page 271 Text --- wetsuit in the pool. Either way, it is a very frustrating situation to be in, especially if you have invested quite a bit of money in your wetsuit. Many Kicktastics and Overgliders have developed their swimming with the idea that they should always keep their eyes

shoes, you are not looking for the best looking or most expensive suit, you are seeking one that both fits you well and is matched to your stroke type. Take a read through the Swim Types section of this book to discover your Swim Type: If you are an Arnie, Bambino or Overglider∗ you are normally suited to a thicker suit with more buoyancy, especially in the hips and legs. If you are a Kicktastic, Swinger or Smooth then a thinner suit with greater flexibility is better matched to your needs. ∗Overgliders fall into two camps with respect to body position: those with very slow stroke rates (under 48 SPM) and with very obvious pauses at the front of the stroke will normally have low sinking legs due to the deceleration in the stroke causing them to sink downwards and would thus benefit from a more buoyant suit. Those with less obvious dead spots and reasonable stroke rates (over 54 SPM) will normally sit very horizontally in the water and as such will benefit from a thinner, more flexible suit. Of course, those in the first scenario (Classic Overgliders) would do well to improve the inefficiencies in their stroke initially, which would then result in the win-win situation of being faster, smoother and more horizontal even without a wetsuit! 2. Spend Time Putting it on Properly Allow yourself some time to put on your wetsuit before the race rather than leaving it to the last moment and trying to put it on frantically. Here are some tips on how to do this properly: Place a plastic bag over your foot like a sock and then slide the wetsuit on like a pair of trousers (Figure 38.29-1), removing the bag once the foot is through the leg of the suit. FIGURE

rates in excess of 85 strokes per minute (SPM) and can hold this rate for hours on end. They might not have the longest strokes in the world but in open water, the rhythm, momentum and a certain degree of punch are perfectly suited to the environment. You might not be able to match their incredibly fast stroke rates but --- Page 278 Text --- even aiming to lift your own by 5-6 SPM will make a difference. Revisit Chapter 14 for more information on increasing your stroke rate. Always make sure you have adequate water support at your venue to ensure your safety. Also remember that in rougher conditions you will sometimes be forced to breathe to one side over the other based on the direction of the swell – don’t be caught out by an inability to breathe to both sides. At points in the course with the swell behind you, you will be able to lengthen out your stroke and adopt a stronger kick to ride the waves home. Watch elite surf-lifesavers in these conditions to pick up valuable tips. Swimming well in rough conditions requires constant application and a lot of determination. All of this may feel a little intimidating if you are used to developing a nice smooth relaxed stroke in the pool but fear not, you can learn to adapt your stroke to cope with this environment and it is great fun when you have got the hang of it. If you know that everyone else is going to struggle in these conditions but that you can lift your stroke rate and punch through the waves and chop then you are going to really excel in your races. Most of all, learn to love the experience: it’s akin to the challenges of a hilly

you have tried the drill. Whenever you perform a drill you should always be aware of the purpose of doing it and the key focus points of the drill; never swim drills for the sake of them without a clear purpose in mind. Drills are a very powerful way to improve your freestyle swimming. They are so effective because: They break down the movement patterns of swimming to help you rectify bad stroke habits. They can slow things down to give you time to think about an area of your stroke. They can isolate a particular area of the stroke which must be peformed well in order for you to swim the drill successfully. You can use all the drills in your training but focus particularly on those that are specific to your individual stroke style and needs. See Appendix C for example stroke technique sessions and Chapter 17 on Swim Types where we examine individual stroke styles in detail. One important thing to bear in mind: if you initially find a drill challenging this is normally a sign that it is focusing on an area of your stroke technique that needs work. Don’t shy away from drills that you find hard – instead work on performing them well and this will make a positive impact on your freestyle stroke technique. Use of Fins The Swim Smooth drills make extensive use of fins (flippers) as they are extremely valuable when developing your stroke technique. They offer you support and propulsion to help you perform the exercises in a relaxed manner. Fins are not cheating if you know why you are using them and have a specific purpose in mind, e.g. working on your swimming posture. Some pools, particularly in the UK, have banned the use of fins during public swimming

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
following drills are missing: Catch-Up is one of the oldest drills and involves swimming with a full catch-up of the arms at the front of the stroke. The purpose of the drill was to emphasise a front quadrant style of swimming but at the same time it flattened body rotation and ran the risk of the swimmer over-emphasising the catch-up style. We recommend the 6- 1-6 drill as a direct replacement, it emphasises body rotation to a much greater extent and helps the swimmer set up for a great catch and pull-through. Traditional Single Arm was swum with one arm out in front of the swimmer, and the other arm stroking. The idea was to isolate an individual arm pull so that the swimmer could focus on it. The weak point of traditional single arm drills (which were sometimes performed with a kick-board held in the lead arm) is that they teach the swimmer to catch the water whilst they are flat on their front. This is bad practice and tends to reduce a swimmer’s body rotation. 6-1-6 and Unco drills are superior modern drills used for these purposes. Swimming With Fists is a way of reducing the effective area of the hand so that the swimmer is encouraged to use their forearm as a paddle. This is a good concept but modern paddles such as Finis PT Paddles are a superior way of achieving the same effect. Swimming with fists causes the swimmer to tense up while in contrast specialist paddles allow the hand to stay in a natural relaxed position. These paddles also leave the fingertips in the waterflow which helps maintain feel whilst still reducing the effective area. Kicking With A Board is used by junior and Masters squads to develop a swimmer’s kick power. Most adult

specialist paddles allow the hand to stay in a natural relaxed position. These paddles also leave the fingertips in the waterflow which helps maintain feel whilst still reducing the effective area. Kicking With A Board is used by junior and Masters squads to develop a swimmer’s kick power. Most adult swimmers do not have the ankle flexibility to kick well with a board as the lift at the front worsens the working angle of the foot against the water – in many cases reducing propulsion to zero. If you are keen on introducing some kick work into your training then we recommend kicking without a board in a torpedo position unless you have very flexible ankles. In the Swim Smooth squads in Perth we perform very few dedicated kick sets. Instead, the kicking performed using fins during drills helps to stretch off the --- Page 283 Text --- swimmer’s ankles and bring their legs into a better kicking position. This, combined with specific use of the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick And Swim Back drills, is our preferred approach to improving an adult swimmer’s kick. As discussed in Chapter 9, for adult swimmers tackling distance swimming events, we are not normally looking to create much kick propulsion. The objective is to improve their kick technique so that the legs are lifted high and together with minimum effort and produce the propulsion from the arm stroke combined with body rotation instead. Sink Downs Exhaling constantly through your mouth or nose as you swim is an essential skill for efficient freestyle.

as you swim is an essential skill for efficient freestyle. Exhaling constantly sounds easy but can be a challenge to get the feel of to begin with, especially if you have many years of holding your breath underwater behind you. --- Page 284 Text --- To help develop your exhalation technique use this sink down exercise at the deep end of your pool. Sink downs are an excellent way to start your swimming session, even before your warm-up. Tread water and take a breath before bringing your arms down by your side and start exhaling into the water. You’re aiming to sink straight down to the bottom without any pauses or delays. Experiment between exhaling from your mouth and nose to see which is most natural to you. Tipping Point When you exhale you may find that you struggle to sink or that you might sink a little and then come back up to the surface. That’s a sign that you’re not exhaling quickly --- Page 285 Text --- enough and that perhaps you are subconciously holding on to your breath. If you initially sink a little but then immediately return to the surface don’t give up, keep exhaling! You will find that you pass through a tipping point and then start to sink down again. As you continue to practise your sink downs aim to get to this point more quickly and sink straight down without the initial delay near the surface. Relaxation The key to getting rid of the air in your lungs is relaxation, if you’re anxious in the water then this will hold you back from exhaling properly.

the air in your lungs is relaxation, if you’re anxious in the water then this will hold you back from exhaling properly. Imagine you’ve had a stressfull day at work and you get home and collapse onto the couch with a big sigh. That is exactly the feeling you’re aiming for as you swim – the sensation of sighing into the water. Also experiment with making sounds as you exhale. Try a ‘brrrrrr’ sound through your lips like a motorbike or humming through your nose. As overly simple as this sounds, these cues really can help you tune into exhaling into the water in a relaxed way. Caution for Beginners If you are new to freestyle swimming it is well worth getting a friend or coach into the water with you to make you feel more comfortable. A bit of moral support can go a long way here as you become accustomed to having your face under the water. Three in a Row When you are able to sink down smoothly and quickly, move on to performing three sink downs in a row. This makes the timing much more like swimming: Take a breath and sink down ridding your lungs of air, when you are empty of air push off and return to the surface. As soon as you surface take an easy deep breath in and sink down straight away again. --- Page 286 Text --- Repeat this three times through. The key point to this exercise is that you are either inhaling or exhaling, you are never holding your breath. As soon as you have completed the three sink downs, push off from the end of the pool and start swimming using the breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe mantra. breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe

you are either inhaling or exhaling, you are never holding your breath. As soon as you have completed the three sink downs, push off from the end of the pool and start swimming using the breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe mantra. breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe As you swim repeat the phrase breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe to yourself. Literally say ‘bubble’ into the water to remind you to exhale; on a breathing stroke say breathe to yourself as you rotate and take a breath in. This mantra helps you to coordinate bilateral breathing and exhalation together. We’re confident that you’ll find it useful to combine these two important areas of good freestyle stroke technique. Ballet Leg Kick Ballet Leg Kick focuses on improving your kicking technique so as to reduce drag and improve your body position in the water.

Gradually shorten the kick, scissoring back and forth by about 60 cm and then kick as hard as you can for five seconds. Really go for it but maintain the good kicking action! Swap sides and repeat with the other leg. The high-effort kicking action helps your nervous system learn an improved kicking technique. Immediately after the drill swim 100 m of easy paced freestyle, simply thinking about pointing your toes and brushing the big toes lightly as they pass. As you swim, how does your body position feel? Are your legs higher? Do you slip through the water more easily? --- Page 288 Text --- Move on to the Torpedo Kick and Swim Back exercise to further reinforce your kicking technique. If you are a ‘leg sinker’ with a low body position both of these exercises should be very beneficial to you. Torpedo Kick and Swim Back To develop and refine your kicking technique use this exercise, which is based on kicking in a torpedo position. This streamlined position is the same one you should be using every time you push off from the wall, it’s the lowest drag position that you can achieve whilst swimming. Place one hand on top of the other and tuck the top thumb around the side of the lower hand. Then reach as high and tall as you can to produce the tuck. If you are flexible enough you should be able to tuck your arms behind your head.

Kick Development Sequence From the end of the lane push off in your torpedo tuck and kick as hard as you can until you run out of air. Aim to be about 50 cm or 1½ ft under the water as you kick along. When you run short of air stop and tread water for a few seconds to catch your breath. Then swim easy freestyle back to the wall that you came from: kick gently and simply focus on tapping your big toes as they pass. How does your body position feel when swimming back? Higher? Do you feel like you’re cutting through the water more easily? Be careful not to over-kick when swimming back, compared to the hard kick during the torpedo it will feel like nearly no kick at all! --- Page 289 Text --- Kicking Focus Repeat this exercise through, each time using one of the following focuses as you streamline and kick: --- Page 290 Text --- Turn your toes inwards slightly and lightly brush them together as they pass. Squeeze your backside as if you have a coin between your bum cheeks! Stretch through the core, stretching your rib cage away from your hips. Think about tiliting your pelvis upwards slightly (as if lifting your backside towards your lower back). Which felt best to you? Which created the most propulsion?

Move on to swimming 200 m easy freestyle thinking solely about your chosen focus. You can return to your chosen visualisation any time you swim if you feel as though your stroke is becoming ragged. Kick on Side Kicking on your side seems like a simple idea but don’t let that fool you, this is a very powerful drill. This exercise and its progressions, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6, are at the core of the Swim Smooth drill pack. Traditionally swim coaches used side-kicking exercises to help swimmer’s become accustomed with swimming on their side to develop their body rotation. This is a worthy goal but Swim Smooth use these drills to develop two other critical parts of the freestyle stroke: The swimmer’s posture and alignment in the water. An excellent catch set up position. Use these drills to improve these two aspects of your swimming and you can dramatically increase your speed and efficiency in the water. --- Page 291 Text --- Side Kicking Use fins and push off from the end of the pool, bringing yourself perfectly onto your side at 90°. Kick at a steady pace and take your lower arm out in front of you and rest your top arm lightly by your side. Face downward and exhale into the water whilst you are kicking. When you need to take a breath simply turn your head to breathe before returning it to the water: --- Page 292 Text --- Without any further thought, try this exercise and see how you perform. Do you track straight or weave about in the lane? Perform a single arm stroke to swap sides after 25 m, are you better or worse on the other side? Now try the exercise again and become aware of the position of your lead hand. Is it

the lead hand to face the bottom of the pool and tip the wrist very slightly so the fingers are lower than the wrist. Don’t do this too much or you will feel your hand being pulled down towards the bottom of the pool. If you have a tendency to bring your fingertips towards the surface of the water think about going a little deeper with the whole arm. This will leave you in a much better catch set up position. With your hand angled correctly now check the position of your elbow, is it dropped down low in the water? Bringing it higher than the wrist will give you a lot more support. The shape you make between your elbow, wrist and fingers is slightly curved, like the shape of an aeroplane wing. --- OCR from Page 293 Image 1 --- # “'s --- Page 294 Text --- 6-1-6 6-1-6 is a progession of the Kick On Side drill. Develop your alignment, posture and hand set up position before moving on to 6-1-6 and then 6-3-6. 6-1-6 involves kicking on the side in the same manner as side kicking for around six kicks.

Continue on this side for six more kicks before swapping sides again. As you perform the arm stroke recover the back hand over the top of the water first and keep the lead hand in position. Let your hands nearly catch-up in front of your head before starting the underwater stroke to rotate onto your other side. In your full stroke you would not fully catch-up in front of your head in this manner but this is good technique for 6-1-6. If you are a Bambino or an Arnie Swim Type you may find that you have a strong tendency for the lead hand to collapse down before the recovering arm reaches it. That’s fine and perfectly normal. If you struggle to keep it in front, try using something as a relay baton, in Perth we use Berrocca vitamin tubes. Keep this tube held between the thumb and first finger of your lead hand and when the top hand comes over, transfer it into your other hand. This will help you coordinate the catch up action. The timing of the breathing is important in 6-1-6: take the breath immediately after the stroke, not before! So the drill is really 6-1-breathe-6. This makes the breathing timing as close as possible to full stroke freestyle. 6-1-6 challenges you to maintain your hand positions and posture during the arm stroke. It’s common to see swimmers crossover or drop their elbow as the new hand enters the water and then immediately correct themselves. Instead of doing this, aim to enter straight into the correct position by maintaining

drill, experiment with adding a touch more rhythm and tempo to the movements. If you’re too gentle with it you will struggle --- Page 303 Text --- to feel the water properly so lift the tempo a touch to develop the rhythm and timing of a good catch. When Doggy Paddle is performed well you can move quite quickly! Technique Sets As with sculling, transition from Doggy Paddle straight into some full-stroke freestyle so as to transfer the catch movement into your swimming: 15 m Doggy Paddle into 35 m rhythmical freestyle Doggy Paddle can be combined with Scull #1 very nicely – the two drills complement each other very well: 10 m Scull #1 + 15 m Doggy Paddle + 25 m swim Doggy Paddle is a mainstay of the Swim Smooth drill pack, all swimmers should perform it regularly in their training sessions in order to develop their catch technique and stroke timing. Scull #1 Sculling is an extremely valuable drill to help you develop your ‘feel for the water’ – how it feels to position and time the catch and pull movements of the stroke correctly. The most important of the sculling positions and the one you should practise the most is Scull #1. This replicates the point in the stroke out in front of the head where you first latch onto and catch the water. Most swimmers press downward, to the side or even --- Page 304 Text --- forwards in this position. Scull #1 teaches you to begin pressing the water backwards at this critical point of the stroke. If you struggle to perform this drill at first don’t be put off, this simply highlights that the catch is a weak point in your stroke and that you will benefit greatly from developing your ‘feel

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
from the catch to the pull phase. This drill is very useful if you have a tendency to pull wide with your arm stroke or pull through with a straight arm. As with Scull #1, always use a pull buoy and push off with your head above the surface, looking forwards. --- Page 307 Text --- Scull the water directly under the head by keeping the elbows fixed in place, changing the pitch of the hand to keep a light pressure on the palm. Scull from just wider than your body’s width into the centre. This position offers you less support than Scull #1 and you may feel that you sink a little lower in the water. Don’t tense up because of this, relax and breathe smoothly. Control the position of the elbows and keep them fixed in place. Change the angle at the elbow to generate the sculling action, moving from around 90° elbow bend at the middle of the scull before opening out to around 160° at the widest point. --- Page 308 Text --- Complete 10–15 m of the drill and then transition into freestyle with a light focus on bending the elbows and pressing the water backwards under the head. Scull #1 can be used in combination with Scull #2, for instance: 10 m Scull #1 into 10 m Scull #2 into 30 m freestyle This sequence helps you ‘feel the water’ during the catch phase and through into the pull under the body.

Drill Unco is a special drill which helps you to develop the rhythm and timing of your stroke. We love Unco at Swim Smooth as it brings so many elements of your stroke together and forces you to time your catch, pull and body rotation correctly. You can even use it to polish up the timing of your breathing. Australians love to shorten any word and put an ‘o’ on the end - in this case shortening ‘uncoordinated’ to make Unco. This probably tells you straight away that it is quite a challenging drill! We’d encourage any swimmer to give it a try but it is probably best suited and most beneficial for upper-intermediate and advanced level swimmers. If you are a bit of an Overglider or have any dead spots or pauses in your stroke then you’ll find Unco challenging but very useful. Unless you have an exceptionally propulsive kick, always use fins when performing Unco. It’s a one-arm drill, performed with one arm by your side whilst the other arm performs a full stroke. Try 4 × 100 m with each 100 m swum as: 25 m left arm Unco + 25 m freestyle breathing right + 25 m right arm Unco + 25 m freestyle breathing left How Should It Feel? Since you are only using one arm with a gap between strokes, Unco is always going to have a surge to it: the surge should be forwards with the propulsion coming from the stroking arm. If you feel like you are bobbing up and down a lot then this highlights that you are pressing down on the water at the front of the stroke. This only lifts you up, which doesn’t generate any propulsion and acts to sink your legs, creating drag. If you feel like

the water. However, stay flat on that dead side and the arm recovery will be very tough! If you struggle to coordinate the drill don’t worry, that’s normal – in fact that’s the whole idea and it simply highlights that the timing of your stroke may need some work. When you get it right Unco should feel smooth and rhythmical. Waterpolo Drill Head-up Waterpolo drill is useful for advanced level swimmers as it improves the rhythm and timing of their stroke. The drill is particularly effective for removing dead spots as it’s nearly impossible to swim head-up with a pause in the stroke! Keep your chin on the surface and swim with positive stroke movements and a strong rhythm. Keep the head still and looking forwards, try and relax as much as possible and don’t forget to breathe! The key to this drill is to swim it at near sprint pace over short distances. It’s physically demanding so unless you’re very adept at the drill, stick to 25 m at a time as a maximum. Too many swimmers perform Waterpolo style drills at the slowest pace they can but for developing stroke rhythm, faster is better as long as good control can be maintained. --- Page 312 Text --- If 100% is a full sprint then a 90% effort is about right for the drill. If you struggle with Waterpolo try it wearing a pair of fins to give you a little assistance, or even a pull buoy. After performing the drill, transition into a set of short fast efforts swum with a fast stroke rate. For example: 2 × 25 m Waterpolo drill at 90% effort 2 × 25 freestyle at 90% effort – emphasise rhythm 2 × 25 m Waterpolo drill at 90% effort 2 × 25 freestyle

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
the drill, transition into a set of short fast efforts swum with a fast stroke rate. For example: 2 × 25 m Waterpolo drill at 90% effort 2 × 25 freestyle at 90% effort – emphasise rhythm 2 × 25 m Waterpolo drill at 90% effort 2 × 25 freestyle at 90% effort – fast rhythmical stroke Swimming with Bands Swimmming with bands is another drill which focuses on delivering better rhythm and timing to your stroke. Wearing a band around your ankles stops you kicking and also adds a little drag to the back of your stroke, which will want to pull your legs downward. For most swimmers we recommend using a pull buoy between your legs at the same time but if you have good natural buoyancy you can perform the drill without one. Swim normal freestyle with your upper body and swim with a high stroke rate, getting into your catch quickly. Stretch tall through your core, lifting your rib cage away from your hips as much as possible. Swim short distances at a time such as 25 m or 50 m. This drill never feels easy as everyone’s legs sink to a greater or lesser extent. The key is to keep your legs as high as possible during the drill by using a good stroke rhythm and a stretched core. When you transition back to normal swimming you’ll have a heightened awareness of your body position and stroke rate. --- OCR from Page 312 Image 2 --- hey --- Page 313 Text --- You can experiment with your stroke whilst wearing a band to see the effect it has on your body position. Try: Pushing down on the water during the catch with a straight arm. Pushing the water forwards as if overgliding and putting on

main ways of kicking in swimming, a 6-beat kick or a slower 2-beat kick. You may have heard about the efficiency benefits of using a 2-beat kick but for most Arnies with low-lying legs a light 6-beat kick will suit you much better as it will help to keep your legs higher in the water. Whilst a 2-beat kick uses less kicking effort this will be more than offset by a low-lying body position from the lack of lift created. Bambino Stroke Correction Process If you are a Bambino, use the process below to develop your swimming. Work on one thing at a time, for instance you might start with working through steps 1–3 for a few sessions before moving on to more advanced steps. Sometimes it takes things a while to ‘stick’ but that’s OK, keep practicing and they will come together nicely in your stroke. ADAM: Always keep a positive approach to your swimming and enjoy every small improvement made along the way – not only will this keep you motivated but a positive approach will directly result in a more confident and positive stroke style, which will be a great thing for your swimming. I love coaching Bambinos as they’re swimming for all the right reasons – because they enjoy it and would love to be good at it! A personal plea from me: keep setting yourself small challenges, think of yourself as a proper swimmer and don’t be afraid to push yourself. You may be surprised at what you can achieve in the water; most Bambinos are much better swimmers than they allow themselves to believe! The Bambino: more confidence and a better ‘feel for the water’ is required! --- Page 318 Text --- 1. Develop your exhalation technique by using the Sink Down and Breathe

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
now that we have improved your stroke timing in steps 3 and 4. 6. Develop a basic ‘feel for the water’ using the Scull #1 drill. You may well find sculling quite a challenging exercise at first but that’s OK, this is highlighting a bit of a hole in your proprioception (body awareness) at this point in front of your head. Do not be put off by this; you have much to gain by developing this area of your stroke. Make sure that your fingertips are pointing at a downward angle into the water and that your elbows are higher than your wrist – you may have to go a little deeper with your hands than you might expect in order to achieve this. 7. Further improve your catch mechanics using the Doggy Paddle drill. Perform this drill quite strongly using positive arm movements, focusing on bending your elbow out in front of your head, really exaggerating the movement of ‘reaching over the barrel’. Transition into full freestyle and feel yourself being pushed through the water on every arm stroke. 8. Increase your stroke tempo by performing some short fast efforts, for instance 4 × 50 m swimming. If you own a stroke beeper such as a Wetronome or Finis Tempo Trainer Pro, set this to 5–10 strokes per minute higher than your normal stroke rate and simply time your strokes to the beep. Even though this is faster than normal it will not necessarily feel harder because the increased sense of rhythm will benefit your stroke. Kicktastic Stroke Correction Process If you are a Kicktastic, use the following process to develop your swimming. The main feature is in step 4 where we develop your catch and ‘feel for the water’. As you make the shift to upper-body propulsion you

is very much cheating! Perform Scull #1 first, focusing on developing a good catch position with the elbows higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips. Once you are beginning to feel the water on the palms of your hands, move on and try Doggy --- Page 321 Text --- Paddle. As you perform the drill imagine that there’s a rope under your body around 50 cm (1½ ft) beneath you – if you pull through with a straight arm then you will be deeper than the rope so you need to bend your elbow in order to keep your hand on the line of the rope. You can also visualise swimming in a very shallow pool or perhaps over a sharp coral reef in about 50 cm of water! Doggy Paddle is a great drill for Kicktastics as it really emphasises their body rotation on every stroke. Exaggerate your body roll during the drill and repeat this mantra to yourself: ‘reach and roll!’ The Classic Kicktastic: over-kicking from the knee and pressing down with a straight arm in front of the head. Once you have the hang of sculling and Doggy Paddle, try this special progression meant only for Kicktastics. It’s a powerful way of helping you shift to upper-body propulsion: Use a pull buoy and perform Scull #1 for around 10 m∗, really tuning into the feeling of the water on the palms of your hands. Transition straight into Doggy Paddle for 10 m∗, emphasising your body rotation and pulling through with a nice bent elbow. Now start swimming freestyle, using the Smiley Face On The Palm Of Your Hand visualisation from Chapter 13, pressing the smiley face back to the wall behind you as you swim. After about 15 m∗ of swimming, part your

your body rotation and pulling through with a nice bent elbow. Now start swimming freestyle, using the Smiley Face On The Palm Of Your Hand visualisation from Chapter 13, pressing the smiley face back to the wall behind you as you swim. After about 15 m∗ of swimming, part your legs slightly and release the pull buoy (let it float free) but, critically, bring in your leg kick only very slightly, maintaining the propulsion with your upper body. ADAM: When coaching a Kicktastic they will often tell me that they can really feel the increase in effort in their upper body as they shift towards arm propulsion. When this happens give yourself a little time to adapt to the workload. At first it will feel quite hard but as the aerobic fitness in your core, back and chest muscles develops it will soon feel easier again. Don’t worry, you won’t develop bulging muscles – a serious concern for many young women – I very much doubt you’ll notice any difference in muscle size! 5. Experiment with different head positions to see which is best for your swimming. Many Kicktastics have been told by coaches to look straight down at the bottom of the pool but this is normally very bad advice for them as they have a --- Page 322 Text --- very good body position no matter what head position they choose. Swim 4 × 25 m and on each 25 m, try a different head position: Bury your head low in the water with your chin coming in towards your chest. Look straight down at the bottom of the pool. Look slightly ahead, about 1 m (3 ft) in front of you to the bottom of the pool. Raise the head further and look about 2–3 m (6–9

head low in the water with your chin coming in towards your chest. Look straight down at the bottom of the pool. Look slightly ahead, about 1 m (3 ft) in front of you to the bottom of the pool. Raise the head further and look about 2–3 m (6–9 ft) in front of you. Which feels best and most balanced in your stroke? Try adopting that chosen position whenever you swim to help balance out your stroke. Head position is a very personal thing in swimming, as a Kicktastic you may be best served by having a slightly higher head position than many other swimmers. A Kicktastic’s high body position is exaggerated further when swimming in a wetsuit where the extra buoyancy of the suit can lift you too high at the rear and make you feel very unbalanced. It is well worth experimenting with an even higher head position in your wetsuit to help bring back the balance in your stroke between the front and rear. Overglider Stroke Correction Process If you are an Overglider, follow the process outlined below and refer to the relevant sections of this book to develop your swimming. It’s important that you follow this process in order as making some stroke improvements in the early steps are prerequisites to later developments. The Overglider: removing the dead spot from their stroke will make them much more efficient. --- Page 323 Text --- ADAM: Compared to an Arnie or a Bambino you have far fewer stroke flaws in place and if you compare yourself to other swimmers in public swim sessions you’ll be swimming significantly better than most there. Don’t let this go to your head though: the fact is that very few good freestyle swimmers are seen in public sessions. You can really take

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
idea that your overglide is preceded by a good catch as you feel significant water pressure on the palm of your hand; the only trouble with this is that the water pressure is actually slowing you down significantly and effectively pushing you backwards! Now transition into doing the drill correctly and regaining forward momentum, taking this same sensation into your freestyle stroke along with your renewed focus on pressing the water behind you, not down and certainly not away from you. 5. Improve your stroke timing using the Unco drill. Unco helps time your arm stroke around your body rotation and makes it nearly impossible to keep a dead spot in your stroke. This will be another challenging drill for you but one that’s well worth revisiting and reinforcing as you go forward with your swimming. Waterpolo drill and Swimming With A Band make excellent additions to your swim programme as you will feel your improved stroke timing coming together. 6. Experiment with different head positions to see which works best for you. Many Overgliders have been told to look straight down when they swim but with better exhalation, an improved catch technique and better rhythm and timing you may no longer need to do this to keep your legs high in the water. Swim 4 × 25 m and on each 25 m try a different head position: Bury your head low in the water with your chin coming in towards your chest. Look straight down at the bottom of the pool. Look slightly ahead, about 1 m in front of you to the bottom of the pool. Raise your head further and look about 3–5 m in front of you. Which feels best and most comfortable? If you can successfully use a higher head position it will give

of the pool. Look slightly ahead, about 1 m in front of you to the bottom of the pool. Raise your head further and look about 3–5 m in front of you. Which feels best and most comfortable? If you can successfully use a higher head position it will give you a much greater proprioception (body awareness) of what’s happening out in front of your head, helping you to refine and --- Page 325 Text --- maintain your catch technique. This is one reason why elite swimmers prefer this head position. 7. Use a stroke rate beeper such as a Wetronome or Finis Tempo Trainer Pro to help reinforce the improved rhythm in your stroke. With an improved catch technique you will be pressing the water backwards rather than pressing it downward, this takes less time and helps to lift your stroke rate naturally. Often you will not even be aware that your stroke rate has lifted. Set your stroke rate beeper back to what your natural stroke rate was before you started this stroke development process. How does it feel? Uncomfortably slow? Lift your stroke rate upwards with the beeper until you feel your new stroke click back into its rhythm – notice how this does not feel any harder and yet you are moving much quicker and more easily through the water. This is an indication that your swimming is becoming really efficient! As you continue forwards from here a stroke rate beeper will be an extremely good investment in your swimming, especially if you train outside of a squad. Use it to control and monitor your stroke rate as you continue to refine your catch technique and stroke timing. 8. Experiment with a light 6-beat flutter kick if you do not use one already. Although a 2-beat

sensation, making it feel quite snappy through the hips and core. Keep the fins on and move to a lap of freestyle only breathing to the left. As your right hand enters into the water, roll and breathe to the left and simultaneously try the big deep kick down with the left leg. Make this a very positive movement each time the right hand enters into the water. Repeat the exercise but this time breathing to the right and kicking down with the right leg as the left hand enters into the water. You are unlikely to be able to think about both sides simultaneously as you swim so just focus on one side and simply mirror the other side of your stroke. Progress to swimming using bilateral breathing, timing the leg kick against your hand entry as described. A 2-beat kick looks easy but is an advanced-level skill. Always practise using fins at first and using big exaggerated movements. Once you feel accustomed to the timing of the kick try integrating it into your normal swimming without using fins and with a much more compact and tidy kicking amplitude. Smooth Stroke Correction Process In contrast to the other Swim Type processes, which work on specific weaknesses, these steps are really an all-round once-over on your stroke. As a Smooth there won’t be too much amiss but you will notice the benefits from tuning up a few areas of your stroke that have slipped a little. 1. Give your exhalation technique a tune-up using the Sink Down exercise in Appendix A. Despite your experience as a swimmer, the chances are that your exhalation is not what it could be. This won’t be hard for you to improve but you will need to constantly remind yourself to exhale smoothly and efficiently

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
these or similar exercises from your youth but might not have tried them in a while or focused on the right areas when doing so. We are looking to reignite your ‘feel for the water’, which will have already been assisted by an improved catch set-up from step 2. If you feel like your catch is not what it once was then pay attention to bending your elbow early in front of your head – both drills will assist you in doing so. 4. Introduce bilateral breathing if you are not already breathing to both sides regularly. With a good exhalation technique into the water and no hint of overgliding in your stroke you will find breathing every three strokes straightforward for the majority of your training. Bilateral breathing helps you to balance out your stroke and gives you practice at breathing to both sides – an important tactical consideration for racing well in the open water. 5. Check your breathing timing by visualising turning your head away from your arm as it enters the water and extends forwards on a breathing stroke. Turn your head smoothly away so that you never get a glimpse of it entering the water and --- Page 330 Text --- you will find that you have more time to inhale, which will make things feel much more relaxed. Late breathing is shown on the top sequence: the body rotates between (1) and (2) and then the head lifts to breathe (3). Correct timing is shown on the bottom row. The head rotates to breathe in time with the extension of the arm forwards. 6. Rhythm and timing is an important component of any great freestyle stroke and after steps 1–5 it is time to revisit it in your stroke. Use the Unco drill to

C Training Sessions About These Training Sessions To create a training session, pick from the training sets in this guide. We’ve provided six of each type to choose from: Warm-up. Build sets. Technique focused main sets. Fresh and fruity (CSS). Long endurance sets (suitable for Ironman and long distance open water swimmers). Sprint sets. Open water skills sets. Cool-downs. Each type of set is available as one of six themes: 1. Something Classically Simple (aimed loosely at Arnies). 2. Something Relaxing (aimed loosely at Bambinos). 3. Something A Little Different (aimed loosely at Kicktastics). 4. Something More Technical (aimed loosely at Overgliders). 5. Something Rhythmical (aimed loosely at Swingers). 6. Something Smooth (aimed loosely at Smooths). Pick a set that suits your Swim Type or your mood and ‘mix and match’ with other sets to create a whole session. The endurance sets stand alone as sessions by themselves but for everything else construct your session as a sequence of: Warm-up set. Build set. Main set chosen from: technique, fresh and fruity (CSS), sprint or open water skills. Cool-down set. In total there are over 5,000 combinations to experience!

Page 9 Text --- This page intentionally left blank --- Page 10 Text --- Climbing the Steps to Swimming Success Swimming has been practiced as both a sport and a recreational activity for thou- sands of years. People at the highest levels of competition swim with such grace and ease that it seems almost effortless. For a beginner or novice, on the other hand, swimming may seem like an exhausting chore that can be done well only by people who possess a natural talent for it. The truth, however, is that anyone can learn to swim—and swim well. With this goal in mind, Swimming: Steps to Success shows you how to feel more comfortable in an aquatic environment and takes you through a progression of skills for each of the competitive strokes. Step 1 starts with the basics—floating and finding your natural buoyancy. Step 2 addresses ways of manipulating the water for propulsion. Steps 3 through 6 cover the fundamentals of the four competitive strokes—freestyle, backstroke, breast- stroke, and butterfly. Steps 7 and 8 focus on turns and starts, and step 9 addresses open-water and survival swimming. Step 10, the final step, gives you some guidance for continuing your swimming journey. The Steps to Success approach to swimming is systematic in building on a solid foundation of skills and techniques. Each step should be approached in the following manner: 1. Carefully read all material in the step. 2. Study the technique photos and, if necessary, use a mirror or a friendly observer to duplicate them yourself. 3. Study the common errors that coaches look for so that you can avoid them! 4. When reading about and executing the drills, keep in mind that they are often designed as “overcorrections” for a specific technique flaw. Drills are intended to help you

move- ments that are not part of any other athletic activity. Be patient with yourself; the key is your progress. As with any journey, no matter how long or short, this one begins with the first step. x --- Page 12 Text --- The Sport of Swimming This book is a guide to help you better understand the fundamentals of swim- ming, which can be defined simply as the act of propelling oneself through the water. Because an instructional book cannot reasonably address all of the rules and regulations applied to swimming, this introduction provides an overview of the sport and introduces certain swimming terms commonly used by coaches and swim- mers. Throughout the rest of the book, each term is further defined in the context in which it is typically used. The sport of swimming has been around for thousands of years, dating back at least to 36 BCE, when Japanese people held organized swimming contests. From then right up until today, it has been a very simple matter to determine the winner of a swimming contest: whoever finishes first! Over the years, races have covered a variety of distances, ranging from about 25 yards (23 m) to lengths that could be measured in miles or kilometers. Races can be further separated into disciplines, or strokes; they can also involve medleys, in which various strokes are used, and team relay races. In modern swim- ming, the strokes include freestyle (also known as the front crawl), backstroke, breast- stroke, and butterfly. Modern rules dictate the specifics of format, but the essential structure of each race is the same: a start, a swim, and a finish. The AquATiC environmenT Swimming differs from other sports in several ways. For one thing, swimming is not necessarily a natural activity for human beings. Indeed,

measure of protection from xiv --- Page 16 Text --- The Sport of Swimming the sometimes-harsh chemicals or other environmental factors in the water. These environmental factors can include the sun when outside, bacteria in the water, and other chemicals in the water—such as a residual-like suntan lotion that came off other swimmers, runoff from chemicals on the deck when it rains, or other chemicals from pollution that can be found in open-water environments. Swim caps are made often of latex, silicone, or (for very cold water) neoprene; they vary in style and price. If you decide to wear a cap, take care to choose one that works for you. Cap sizing tends to be one-size-fits-all, but small differences do exist from brand to brand. Keep in mind that, like rubber bands, caps can stretch and break; they typically include a care-and-use guide in their packaging. geTTing STArTed: TrAining equiPmenT In swimming, training equipment is often used to conduct drills and improve swim- ming-specific movements by increasing resistance. It can also serve as an assistive device that enables swimmers to isolate a specific movement or set of skills. Such equipment is not necessary for the sport, but it can make many skills and drills easier to master and perfect. At many facilities, equipment is made available to patrons, thus enabling you to test out the gear and learn what to look for if you choose to pur- chase your own. Common equipment used in swimming includes kickboards, fins, paddles, pull buoys, and snorkels. Kickboards The kickboard (figure 2) is a fairly common piece of equipment found in many swim- mers’ training bags. It is typically made of some sort of foam to provide flotation. Its purpose is to provide a buoyancy assist so that swimmers can isolate and train the

Back Floating With Arms Extended The objective here is to lie back on the water with your arms and legs spread out for balance, almost like a starfish, and float without movement (figure 1.1). Before you 1 --- Page 21 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success try it, here are a couple of mental cues to help you quickly succeed. The first cue addresses head position. Imagine having a dot on the top of your head that must stay wet. Many swimmers are uncomfortable having the head so far in the water, especially when water goes into the ears, but the water will come back out! The second cue addresses body position. The goal is to keep your spine as elon- gated and horizontal as possible. If you feel your feet sink, do not crunch with your abs but rather push your navel to the top of the water. Some swimmers also find it helpful to close their eyes in order to concentrate on how it feels to balance in the water. Remember the teeter-totter—the minute you lift your head, your hips go down.

Be sure that your neck is relaxed and your head is back. missTeP Your hips sink. correcTion Ensure that your abs are not contracted (as in doing crunches); this part of your body should be relaxed.

Keep your spine straight and your limbs relaxed and out to the sides rather for balance. Once you are able to do this successfully for at least a few seconds, it is time to move on to more advanced floating skills. Back Floating in a T Position The next part of this progression involves taking away some of the surfaces that swimmers use for balance. Repeat the same skill just described, but this time keep your arms out while bringing your legs together, thus making a T rather than a star- fish (figure 1.2). This action requires a little more control and ability to relax on the water. Here again, the mental cue is that your face, chest, hips, and toes should all be at the surface—only this time they should also all be in the same line along the axis of your

progression involves bringing your hands in to the sides of your body. As you become more comfortable with this balanced position, you can try a more advanced floating technique. From your sides, bring your hands up above your head, stretching to the longest possible position (figure 1.3). This is a more advanced floating skill, and succeeding at it is a major accomplishment; in fact, some people who have difficulty mastering it still go on to become very accomplished swimmers. Once you have mastered these skills, it is time to practice them with modifications and drills. Figure 1.3 Back FloaTing in a sTraighT line Preparation Execution 1. Begin by checking the water 1.

This time, pick up your feet rather than pushing off of the bottom of the pool; alternatively, you can tread water if you are performing the drill from a vertical position in a deep pool. The drill consists of starting vertical and achieving a horizontal back float, then lifting your head and returning to vertical. It helps you achieve the

of the bottom of the pool; alternatively, you can tread water if you are performing the drill from a vertical position in a deep pool. The drill consists of starting vertical and achieving a horizontal back float, then lifting your head and returning to vertical. It helps you achieve the horizontal back float and attend to how your head position affects your body position. Returning to the teeter-totter analogy, when one end (your head) goes up, the other end (your hips) goes down. Practice this drill several times in order to develop a good sense of balance. To increase diFFiculTy • Use only a kicking motion with your legs or your hands to manipulate your position in the water, but not both. To decrease diFFiculTy • Use both your arms and your legs. Back-Floating Drill 3 Touch your nose This drill builds on the skill of floating on the water in a T position. Assume the hori- zontal back-float position with your arms straight out to your sides, then touch your nose with an index finger while continuing to float. Repeat with the index finger of the opposite hand. This more advanced drill helps you develop not only vertical and horizontal balance but also lateral or side-to-side balance. As you get the hang of it, try passing a tennis ball from one hand to the other while maintaining your balance.

Front Floating in a Straight Line The last part of this progression involves bringing your hands in front of your body (figure 1.6). As before, imagine your face, chest, hips, and heels all at the surface— only now they are also in the same line down the axis of your body. Once again, you can try this skill while holding your breath until you have a stable floating position, then slowly exhale. You may feel a little like you are sinking as you exhale due to the change in the volume of air in your lungs. This is a more advanced floating skill, and succeeding at it is a major accomplishment; at the same time, most swimmers find it easier than doing the same thing on the back.

Some of the drills do not resemble swimming, but they show you how manipulating your body position and putting pressure on the water in different ways can help you achieve your goal of success in swimming! 20 --- Page 40 Text --- Step 2 Manipulating the Water The goal of this second step is to increase your awareness of drag force, propul- sive force, and how specific movements create propulsion and minimize drag. In other words, this step helps you understand how to use your body’s surfaces to apply pressure on the water in order to move through it. By the end of this step, you should be able to • achieve an aquatic position that minimizes drag; • get a feel for the water and where it slips off of your hands when anchoring your hands during the crucial catch phase of a stroke; • use a sculling motion for propulsion; and • use flutter, dolphin, and breaststroke kicks for propulsion, both on your back and on your front.

catch phase of a stroke; • use a sculling motion for propulsion; and • use flutter, dolphin, and breaststroke kicks for propulsion, both on your back and on your front. Drag Force anD ProPulsive Force Drag force slows you down, whereas propulsive force makes you move. Drag force is easy to understand if you think in terms of skydiving. While falling, skydivers accel- erate due to gravity. They accelerate more if they make themselves skinny and verti- cal (i.e., streamlined), thereby minimizing their cross-sectional area (the area facing in their direction of travel) and in turn minimizing the resistance or drag force that acts on them. On the other hand, if they spread their arms and legs out and become more horizontal, they maximize the area that is perpendicular to their direction of fall and thus slow down due to air resistance. At some point, our daredevils deploy their parachutes, greatly increasing their cross-sectional area, in order to slow down even more and avoid plummeting to their doom. What does this have to do with swimming? Aerodynamics and hydrodynamics have a lot in common! The big difference lies in the fact that water is about 750 times denser than air and therefore involves much higher drag force. This strong resistance is the reason that high divers can slow down so quickly upon entering the water even at very high speeds. Of course, it also slows down swimmers. At the same time, however, water gives swimmers a denser surface upon which to apply pressure than air does. Swimmers can take advantage of this density by using 21 --- Page 41 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success propulsive force to their advantage. Specifically, they apply pressure to the water in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction in which they want

### Swimming STEPS TO SUCCESS_full_text.txt
catch phase (figure 2.2), in which the key surface (whether in the form of one hand or both hands) enters the water and begins to get perpendic- ular to the direction in which you are going. For a mental representation of the catch phase, swimmers think about anchoring the hand in the water, which hinges on three factors. The first factor involves water movement. Turbulent water (as in a washing machine) makes it hard to establish an anchor since the water is already moving. To minimize this problem, find water that is not disturbed in front of you and stretch to reach it. The second factor involves the pitch or angle of the hand(s). Recall that it is almost always best to put pressure on the water in a direction perpendicular to your direction of travel. As a general rule, your fingers should almost always be pointed slightly down on each stroke in order to encourage at least your hand to be perpendicular to your direction of travel. The last factor is strength. If you do not yet have the strength to hold the water, your hand will waffle through it. Alternatively, being unable to hold the water may relate to bad balance, which can weaken the propulsive force enough that it does not overcome the drag force. Both of these issues can be corrected over time through practice. 24 --- Page 44 Text --- Manipulating the Water Figure 2.2 Basic caTch Preparation 1.

takes time to master. It requires movements that are not fast, rigid, or mechanical but slow, controlled, and fluid. Use slow, rhythmic move- ments and make sure that your hands never stop; they should be sweeping either out or in at any given time. Failure to master this skill does not prevent a person from swimming, but mastering it enables greater proficiency in later stages of the learning process. Repeat the drill several times, experimenting with hand angle and positioning to see what works best for you in creating propulsion. To develop a good catch, you must feel where the water pressure is on your hands and forearms! To increase DiFFiculTy • Do not use a pull buoy.

KicKing When done correctly, kicking is a powerful part of swimming. The first kick to master is the flutter kick (figure 2.4), which is part of both freestyle and backstroke swimming. It is performed with alternating leg movements designed to put pressure on the water via both up and down movements. The more surfaces you engage in applying pressure, the better. The basic idea here is to initiate the kick in the hip; it is also helpful to use the strong muscles of the core for propulsion, and that technique is

The basic idea here is to initiate the kick in the hip; it is also helpful to use the strong muscles of the core for propulsion, and that technique is addressed in future steps. For now, focus on the basics of kicking as a propulsive force. The following drill progression helps you master the flutter kick. The first part of the progression helps you develop an effective mental image of what your legs are 29 --- Page 49 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success supposed to do. Of course, creatures evolved for swimming use well-adapted body parts to make movements that are long and fluid—for example, the movements of a fish, dolphin, or whale tail. Humans are at a disadvantage in this regard because we have solid bones in our legs rather than reticulated vertebrae, making us less flexible for fluid movement. In compensating for this deficit, it helps to envision the move- ment that you want. You might imagine, for instance, that the knee and ankle of each leg are connected by a rubber band. This image helps you keep your legs long and loose as you drive motion from your lower core. Figure 2.4 FluTTer KicKing Preparation 1. Get in the water and grab the gutter. 2. From a standing position facing the wall, kick your legs up to the surface and make your body horizontal (parallel to the pool bottom). 3.

the pool bottom). 3. At this stage, it is okay to use your fore- arms and the wall to help you achieve a a horizontal position and to have your head out of the water. 4. Keep your legs as long and loose as possible (do not actively point your toes). Execution 1. Make sure that you can sustain a steady rhythmic kick (speed is not important yet) that feels like you are putting pres- sure on the water all the way down the b length of your leg (advanced swimmers have described this feeling as the water seeming to roll all the way down the leg and off the toes). 2. Once you are comfortable in the hori- zontal position, put your face in the water and extend your arms so that just your hands are on the wall. 3. As you continue to kick, you should feel your hands being pressed toward the wall. Maintain the same extended streamlined position that you developed c in step 1. If your hands are grabbing the wall and hanging on instead of being pushed toward the wall, check yourself for correct positioning from hands to toes. 30 --- Page 50 Text --- Manipulating the Water In earlier parts of step 2, you developed a mental image and achieved a horizon- tal position in the water while using your legs to maintain balance. The next part of this step ensures that the kick you are developing is propulsive. With proper kicking imagery, it is now time to use your legs to manipulate and put pressure on the water. As your feet get to the surface, keep in mind that your goal is to put pressure on the water, which means that your legs must be in the water. Many novice swimmers equate

it is now time to use your legs to manipulate and put pressure on the water. As your feet get to the surface, keep in mind that your goal is to put pressure on the water, which means that your legs must be in the water. Many novice swimmers equate kicking hard with big splashes; in reality, however, those splashes indicate that the energy exerted is being absorbed by the water rather than benefitting the swimmer. Try to have just your heel—rather than your whole foot—break the surface of the water. A quick head-to-toe check with the following questions in mind will help to make sure you are performing the skill correctly. 1. Are your arms extended all the way out? 2. Is your core long, or are you doing a “crunching” motion? 3. Is your pelvis tucked under rather than staying flat, thus causing your feet to sink? 4. Do you feel the effort in your glutes and upper thighs, which indicates that you are using your whole leg and core? Or do you feel it in your quads, near your knees, which indicates that you are using only your lower legs? 5. Are your ankles stiff or loose? Loose is good. MissTeP You splash a lot. correcTion To achieve propulsive force, get your feet (and as much other leg surface as possible) in contact with the water. Keep your legs long and loose. MissTeP You don’t go anywhere when you kick. correcTion Rather than point your toes or make your leg stiff, imagine curling your toes. This approach keeps your feet flexed but prevents your legs from being stiff. 31 --- Page 51 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Drills For FluTTer KicKing Once you have gone through all of these helpful cues and can feel the pressure

This approach keeps your feet flexed but prevents your legs from being stiff. 31 --- Page 51 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Drills For FluTTer KicKing Once you have gone through all of these helpful cues and can feel the pressure that you apply to the water, it is time to face the real test of propulsive force—kicking and actually providing some movement forward. Kicking Drill 1 Fingertip Pressure Move about a yard (m) away from the wall, then establish a neutral buoyant posi- tion on your front by lying on the water in the streamlined position described in step 1. Using only your kicking skill, kick toward the wall with your hands stretched out so that your fingertips touch the wall first. Once your fingers have touched the wall, continue kicking so that you feel pressure on your fingertips. This pressure indicates that you have developed a propulsive kick and can purposefully manipulate the water using your legs.

Kicking Drill 2 Kickboard The next part of the progression ensures that your kick is indeed propulsive. Using a kickboard for balance only, place your hands on the lower corners of the board. Facing away from the wall in the water, pull your feet up, place them on the wall, and push off on your front. Make sure that your face is in the water and look directly at the bottom of the pool. Now, begin the same rhythmic kicking that you developed earlier in this progres- sion. It should propel you down the length of the pool at a very slow speed. If you come to a stop or even go backward, check for correct positioning from your hands to your toes. Many swimmers come to the pool with a limited range of motion in the ankles. Make sure that your ankles are slightly plantar-flexed, so that your toes point away from your body, but not so much as to make your legs rigid. 32 --- Page 52 Text --- Manipulating the Water When you need to breathe, simply apply pressure to the kickboard and lift your head for air. Make this motion quick in order to maintain your balance in the water and get your face back in the water to stabilize your balance. As you progress in this part, try rotating the head to the side to breathe. To increase DiFFiculTy • Place your hands together on the kickboard. • Use a less stable pull bouy in the place of a kickboard. • Don’t use a kickboard at all.

KicKing WiThouT a KicKBoarD Once you have mastered the skill with the kickboard (using the Kickboard drill to practice), it is time once again to put your propulsive kicking force to the test. Repeat the process just described, but this time do it without the assistance of the kickboard (figure 2.5). The goal is to kick in a streamlined position. If you were able to do so with a kickboard, then this transition should be a little easier. The new challenge here is that when you breathe, you should use the same sculling motion described ear- lier in this step. Simply sweep your hands out and in rhythmically to apply enough pressure on the water to allow you to lift your head for a quick breath. You can then continue with a freestyle stroke. Once you have mastered this technique—and it may take a few tries—it is time to move to flutter kicking on your back. 33 --- Page 53 Text

FluTTer KicKing on your BacK Flutter kicking on your back (figure 2.6) differs slightly from kicking on your front. Since you are on your back, the kicking motion is up for the most part (you will learn more about that later). Once again, it is helpful to develop an effective mental image—in this case, that of a soccer ball floating on the water that you kick up into the air with the top of your foot. This mental image helps you apply pressure in the right places and recruit the proper muscles. As with kicking on your front, imagine the joints of each leg being connected by a rubber band; staying long and loose is still a key. Remember both your mental image and the feeling of pressure on the water from both the tops

right places and recruit the proper muscles. As with kicking on your front, imagine the joints of each leg being connected by a rubber band; staying long and loose is still a key. Remember both your mental image and the feeling of pressure on the water from both the tops and the bottoms of your feet. Ensure that your toes just break the surface. As before, big splashes do not provide propulsive force and should be avoided. Kicking with your feet and legs coming out of the water makes big splashes. Since you are on your back, your toes will be the first to break the surface. As land-based creatures, we tend to have a natural affinity for leading this kick with the heel, as in a running or cycling motion. In correcting this tendency, it can be helpful to work with a kickboard (as described in the following Missteps section). MissTeP You make big splashes while kicking with your heels first. correcTion Focus on the analogy of a whale or dolphin tail and try to replicate its long, fluid up-and-down motion. 34 --- Page 54 Text --- Manipulating the Water Figure 2.6 FluTTer KicKing on your BacK Preparation 1.

Boardless Kicking Drill 1 Kicking on your Back or your Front Once you have achieved propusion in this position on the back, repeat this same part, the flutter kick on the back, but with your hands now above your head in a streamlined position. Doing so requires you to change your position on the water slightly—your spinal curvature will change—in order to compensate for not having your hands at your sides to help with balance. As before, you should feel the effort in your lower core, specifically there will be muscle contraction and fatigue in your upper thighs and glutes. If you have trouble achieving propulsion, do a simple hands-to-toes check for positioning and technique to ensure that you are doing it right. Once you have mastered this on your back, try the same on your front. When you go to breathe, rotate the head to the side as with the kickboard drill. To increase DiFFiculTy • Drop one arm.

Boardless Kicking Drill 2 underwater Kicking Once you have mastered flutter kicking on both your back and your front on the surface of the water, it is time to fine-tune your kick for maximum benefit. In previous parts of this progression, you have learned how to apply pressure to the water with your legs, feet, and toes. The instructions have emphasized kicking in a specific direction, but the most effective and efficient swimmers can manipulate the water by applying pressure with both the tops and the bottoms of their legs and feet. 36 --- Page 56 Text --- Manipulating the Water The next part of developing this ability involves kicking on a streamline under the water. Remember that at no point should you engage in extended breath holding! Remember also to exhale slowly. As described in step 1, put both feet on the wall and assume a position in which your head, knees, and toes are up. Release the hand from the wall, touch your hands together under the water, and push off in a streamlined position while keeping your head down. Kick underwater for as long as you can before needing a breath; keep your legs long

(figure 2.7) derives its power from the middle part of the core—from the lower part of the rib cage down through the pelvis. Let the strong muscles of your core initiate most of the work. Your legs should stay together the entire time, and, as with the flutter kick, they should be long and loose. A good mental image for this kick is the motion of a dolphin or whale; try to mimic that motion with your body, from your chest on down. Some swimmers also find it help- ful to imagine that their legs are glued together and cannot be separated. To work on this skill, use the same progression used for the flutter kick on your front. 37 --- Page 57 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 2.7 DolPhin KicKing aT The Wall Preparation 1. Get in the water and grab the gutter. 2. From a standing position facing the wall, kick your legs up to the surface and make your body horizontal and par- a allel to the pool bottom. 3.

Put your face into the water and extend your arms so that only your hands are on the wall. Execution 1. Drive your hips back and b forth by using the strong muscles of your core; use your legs merely to finish off the kick. 2. As you continue to kick, you should feel your hands being pressed toward the wall. c In the first few parts of this progression, you have developed a mental image and achieved a horizontal position in the water using your legs to maintain your balance. The next part is to make sure that the kick you are

c MissTeP You just wiggle in the water. correcTion The kick starts at the rib cage and works its way down, much like the motion of a jump rope that has been flipped. Keep your lower legs loose. 39 --- Page 59 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Misstep You nod up and down to make yourself go. CorreCtion The kick comes from the lower core and rib cage; try not to move as if you were bobbing for apples. Misstep Your hands are grabbing on to the wall. CorreCtion Extend the arms and make sure your kick is propulsive rather than having the arms do the work of holding you to the wall. Misstep You curl up and push at the water with your feet. CorreCtion Keep the legs long and loose. Rather than pointing the toes, think about curling them as if picking a penny up off the pool deck. Dolphin Kicking on Your Back Dolphin kicking on your back (figure 2.9) differs only slightly from kicking on your front. As before, developing an appropriate mental image for the action can help you apply pressure in the right places and recruit the proper muscles. The mental image here, as with kicking on your front, is to think of your leg joints as being connected by a rubber band; staying long and loose is still a key. Misstep The water washes back up to your face. CorreCtion The two most likely culprits are your knees breaking the surface of the water and the tops of your feet “pushing” at the water. To correct this misstep and produce a propulsive kick, hold a kickboard with your hands down at your hips, extending the kickboard over your knees.

BreasTsTroKe KicK The last kicking skill is the breaststroke kick (figure 2.10). Draw your heels up to your hips while keeping your knees close together, then point your toes out and apply pressure to the water with your insteps and the inside calf of each leg. The kick is per- formed simultaneously with both legs. The following progression helps you ensure that you are doing it correctly to provide maximum propulsion. 44 --- Page 64 Text --- Manipulating the Water Figure 2.10 BreasTsTroKe KicK WiTh one leg Preparation 1. Begin by standing near the pool wall in water that is at least chest deep. Be sure that your chest is touching the wall. 2. Starting with your right leg, draw your heel up with your knee still touching the wall in the dorsiflexed or L position. Once your thigh is parallel to a the bottom of the pool, stop raising the leg. Execution 1. While in this position, slide your heel out and away from the centerline of your body while keeping your knee in the same place. This action may seem awkward at first. The key is to make sure that your heel is farther from the center of your body than your knee is. You may need to use the wall for balance. 2. Once your foot is in position, b push the instep in a sweep- ing motion down toward the bottom of the pool.

Once you have succeeded with your right foot, try the same motion with your left foot. c 45 --- Page 65 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Breaststroke Kick With Both Legs If you can feel pressure in the critical areas when breaststroke-kicking with each leg, then you are ready to try both legs together (figure 2.11). Some swimmers have prob- lems with flexibility in the hips, knees, and ankles and are not as effective as others, so do not let this frustrate you. For most people, this action requires several repeti- tions to master. Figure 2.11 BreasTsTroKe KicK WiTh BoTh legs Preparation 1. Find deeper water and anchor your arms with your hands or elbows to the gutter a or deck so that your legs hang free. Execution 1. Using the same motion described for breaststroke kick with one leg, draw up b both heels. Next, push both heels out while keeping your knees close together, then sweep your feet together in a circular motion. 2. Your heels should be wider apart than your knees; ide- ally, your knees should be no more than hip-width apart when your heels are outside of your knees. c 3.

The next part of the progression involves lying on your back in the neutral position described in step 1 with your hands at your sides for balance. Once you have achieved equilibrium, draw your heels up while trying to keep your upper legs underwater. This is slightly different from being on the wall but involves the same type of movement. Once your heels are close to your hips, rotate your heels out so that they are wider than your knees, then sweep them together. As before, this motion is more about pressure on the water than about the speed of the movement. Squeeze your ankles together. Did you move? The pressure on the water should have caused you to move headfirst. Once you have completed one kick, return to the neutral position and let your momentum fade. Repeat the same motion until you are comfortable with it. Figure 2.12 BreasTsTroKe KicK WiTh ProPulsion Preparation 1. Perform the wall exercise for the breaststroke kick with both legs first. 2.

Competitive freestyle was born in the late 1800s, when John Arthur Trudgen witnessed native South Amer- icans swimming with an overhand recovery and a wide, scissorlike kick. He carried the stroke back to England, where it took on his name despite being characterized as un-European barbaric thrashing. Around the turn of the century in Australia, a similar stroke was used with a flutter kick by a Solomon Islander named Alick Wickham. That version was devel- oped further by coach Richmond “Dick” Cavill into what we now recognize

Although you start by kicking with a kickboard, you incorporate rotation when breathing. When done correctly, kicking not only provides propulsive force but also assists with balance. The flutter kick, in particular, uses an alternating leg movement, and the whole leg is moved both up and down to put pressure on the water both on the down stroke of the kick and on the upstroke. Many novice swimmers have difficulty with this skill because their legs are too rigid and produce no propulsive power. When done properly, the kick’s power comes from the hip, and the strong muscles of the lower core are actively engaged. The rest of the leg is kept long and loose, and you are encouraged to think of the knee joint and ankle joint of each leg as being connected by a rubber band. In this way, the kick is more likely to be long and fluid rather than stiff and mechanical. It is okay to point your toes slightly, but pointing too aggressively (rather than using your ankle’s natural flexion) can lead to a rigid and unproductive kick. An unproductive kick can also be caused by having your foot out of the water. Remem- ber, the goal is to exert pressure

the kickboard at the bottom and extend your arms. Push off of the wall and begin flutter-kicking on your front with your face in the water. Exhale slowly and drop one arm to your side while rotating. This drill is also a good way to practice your breathing; make sure to turn your hip over and catch a quick breath to the side. Recover your hand over the water as usual. At this point, you may feel your hips sink. This is a problem because it disturbs the line of travel and impedes efficiency. Experiment with the amplitude, size, and frequency of your kicks to keep the hips up. TO increase DiFFicUlTy • Place one hand on the kickboard and kick on your side (right side for 25 yards and left side for 25 yards). • Eliminate the kickboard and kick in a streamlined position. • Kick underwater in a streamlined position.

to a two-beat kick but try to get three or four small kicks in when you breathe; this approach helps you stay aware of where your feet are and reminds you to keep kicking. Here are a couple of keys to keep in mind: Your kick should not be too big. A kick that is too big is outside of the drag shadow, which is a column of water that is moving with you and slightly behind your leading edge. Since it is turbulent already, adding propulsion to it will increase velocity. If your kick goes outside of this column of moving water into nonturbulent water, any surfaces past that turbulent or nontur- bulant interface produce more drag. Also, make sure not to stop your stroke by over- focusing on counting your kicks; if you do have a pause in your stroke at this stage, make sure that it occurs when both arms are out front. You are in the most stream- lined position possible at that point. The drag is minimal compared to the profile for every other part of the movement. Drills FOr TiMing anD rhyThM When you walk with good synchronization of movement, it is effortless, and you really don’t need to think about it very much. In contrast, swimming is a less natural movement for humans, so we have to learn how to put it all together.

Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 1 Three-Quarters catch-Up This is a popular drill for practicing rhythm and timing. Start with the catch-up drill described earlier in this step.

modern backstroke led to several technique changes, as well as revised notions of how to swim the stroke most effectively. The original back- stroke was performed with the arms straight underwater and somewhat loose on the over- the-water recovery, almost as if it were the front crawl or freestyle turned upside down. Later, Australian swimmers used a bent-arm pull and developed a stroke closer to what is recognized as backstroke today. The great advantage of backstroke over other strokes is that the swimmer’s face is out of the water. In addition, swimmers who master the backstroke develop great balance on the water, which also benefits their freestyle stroke. In this step, you will develop the following skills: • Horizontal body line • Rotation on a long axis • Splashless entry and effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Kicking rhythm • Effective breathing • Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective backstroke. A good horizontal position is a key element of an effective backstroke and also lays the foundation for applying force to the water to achieve propulsion. As mastered in step 1 (floating on your back), the basic position involves lying on the water with your head, hips, feet, and hands at the surface. As you remain stretched out on the water, ensure that you are comfortable and balanced. Basic BacksTroke A good armstroke for the backstroke (figure 4.1) consists of four basic elements that provide the bulk of the propulsive force in swimming: catch, pull, finish (with your palm toward your body, not toward the bottom of the pool), and recovery. At some point when the strok- ing arm is near vertical, rotate your hand so that your pinkie finger leads the

elements that provide the bulk of the propulsive force in swimming: catch, pull, finish (with your palm toward your body, not toward the bottom of the pool), and recovery. At some point when the strok- ing arm is near vertical, rotate your hand so that your pinkie finger leads the stroke recovery. Remember that as you work on mastering a skill, it is crucial to move in a slow, controlled manner at first. As you may notice, kicking is not mentioned here; this does not mean that you should not kick but simply that you should focus on the skill being described. 77 --- Page 97 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 4.1 Basic BacksTroke Preparation 1.

MulTiple-sTroke BacksTroke Once you have gone through one stroke cycle—one right arm and one left arm—it is time to put together multiple stroke cycles. Unlike the “catching up” pattern of freestyle, in backstroke your hands should always be at opposite ends of the stroke pattern (figure 4.2). For safety, practice this skill in a pool that is long enough for seven to ten strokes and equipped with backstroke flags. The flags are placed 5 yards from the end of the pool, and most swimmers can take two or three strokes after passing beneath them before reaching the wall. 79 --- Page 99 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 4.2 Multiple-stroke backstroke.

a proper entry, catch, and pull by isolating the movements so that you can focus on just one portion of the stroke. The three drills presented here also help you with rotation and rhythm. Armstroke Drill 1 six-kick switch This drill helps you with armstrokes, balance, and timing. To perform the drill, begin kicking on your back with both hands above your head. Turn over slightly to your side and pull one arm down to the side. Hold your position on the side—with one arm extended and its pinkie finger down and your other arm flat against your side— for six kicks. Then pull again as your hands switch places. Repeat the drill for the length of the pool. To increase DiFFiculTy • Close your hand into a fist to ensure that you get a catch with your fore- arm as well as your hand.

The kick used for the backstroke is the flutter kick (figure 4.4). It fea- tures alternating leg movement, and the whole leg is moved up and down to put pressure on the water both on the downstroke and on the upstroke. This kick is generally the same one used in freestyle swimming but with a few minor points of difference. As in freestyle, think of each leg’s knee joint and ankle joint as being connected by a rubber band. In this way, the kick is more likely to be long and fluid rather than stiff and mechanical. In another pitfall, many swimmers tend to “paw” at the water by emphasizing the downkick and neglecting the upkick or by raising the leg too high out of the water. Figure 4.4 BacksTroke kicking Preparation 1. Make sure that the lane is clear and the backstroke flags are in place. Execution 1. Lie on the water in the neutral a position. 2.

Keep the lower part of your leg loose and think of curling your toes rather than pointing them. Drills For kicking To practice developing a propulsive kick, try the following drills. Remember that the leg movements should be long and fluid. Kicking Drill 1 kickboard This is a good drill for developing flutter-kick basics on your back. To do it, grab the kickboard at the bottom and extend your arms down this time. Push off of the wall and begin flutter-kicking on your back with the kickboard down across your upper legs. Experiment with the amplitude or size of the kick, as well as the frequency. Only your toes should break the surface—not your knees. If you do it incorrectly or “bicycle,” your knees will bounce off of the kickboard. In this case, remember that you just need to have your toes touch the surface. To increase DiFFiculTy • Eliminate the kickboard and kick in a streamlined position. • Kick underwater in a streamlined position. To

shooters This drill helps you develop both your kicking and your body positioning. To perform the drill, sink underwater, achieve a streamlined position on your back, and push off of the wall forcefully. Then start kicking as fast as you can in order to go as far as you can underwater, keeping in mind that of course you will need to come up for air. Remember that your body position dictates your depth; if your head is down you will stay down, but the moment you lift your head or look toward your feet you will rise to the surface. Many swimmers use a nose clip to prevent water from going up the nose; it can also be prevented by exhaling slowly through your nose. Repeat this drill several times to increase your distance from the wall.

backstroke. Unlike freestyle, in which your hands pass above your head and almost “catch up” to each other, backstroke is a hands-opposite type of stroke. That is, one hand should be entering the water as the other hand is exiting. The following drills help you develop a good timing pattern for a smooth and rhythmic stroke 95 --- Page 115 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 1 switch In this easy drill, you simply hold one arm out and above in the catch position and the other arm down at your thigh.

are well on your way to an effective breaststroke. The breaststroke is the only one of the four competitive strokes that derives its propulsive force equally from the pull and the kick; therefore, you should give equal attention to both elements. This double focus is one factor that makes the breast- stroke so elusive for some swimmers. At any level, if you look across the race pool, you will find a greater variety of styles being used for the breaststroke than for any other competitive stroke. Some swimmers use a wider pull or kick, whereas others use a quicker stroke rate and still others a longer rate. Bottom line: there is no agreed- upon best way to do this stroke. 99 --- Page 119 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success As with the other strokes, however, there are certain basic movements that pro- vide propulsive force and minimize drag. More specifically, though it is true that you can have a weaker kick in the freestyle or backstroke and still muscle your way through; the same cannot be said of the breaststroke. Therefore, the first element to focus on in the breaststroke is a good kick. BreasTsTroke kick The following skills and drills will help you master what is the most complex of strokes: the breaststroke.

Hold the position, glide, and then repeat. c 100 --- Page 120 Text --- Breaststroke MissTep You draw the knees outside before the heels. correcTion Leading with the knees causes you to wedge the water with the whole leg and places an increased stress on the hips. Instead, think of the knees as being separated by the width of just your hands. Alternately, placing a small buoy higher above the knees when kick- ing during the breaststroke will accomplish the same thing. Many swimmers experience the following problems in kicking with the breaststroke. To avoid these common mistakes, review the drills from step 2. • Kicking “out” as if doing a side kick rather than anchoring the instep and pushing • Bringing the heels up either too far or not far enough • Kicking with the toes pointed • Drawing out with the knees rather than keeping them in • Keeping the legs together • Not controlling the core and thus making the finish more of a dolphin kick Keep these pitfalls in mind in order to avoid later problems that can result from the lack of an effective propulsive kick.

later problems that can result from the lack of an effective propulsive kick. Drills for kickinG As mentioned in step 2 (manipulating the water), a good propulsive breaststroke kick is all about putting pressure on the water with the legs from the knee down. For a refresher, practice the following drills. Kicking Drill 1 Wall kick Begin by standing near the pool wall in water that is at least chest deep with your back touching the wall. Starting with your right leg, draw the heel up with the knee still touching the wall in the dorsiflexed or L position. Once your thigh is parallel to the bottom of the pool, stop raising the leg. While in this position, slide your heel out and away from the centerline of your body while keeping your knee in the same place. This action may seem awkward at first. The key is to make sure that your heel is farther from the center of your body than your knee is. You may need to use the wall for balance. Once your foot is in position, push the instep in a sweeping motion down toward the bottom of the pool. You have succeeded when you can feel pressure from the water on your instep and on the inside of your calf. Once you have succeeded with your right foot, try this same motion with your left foot. Once you are comfortable with this motion, try both together.

Kicking Drill 2 Moving Through the Water Now that you feel the pressure on the water, it is time to ensure that it is propulsive pressure by moving through the water. The next part of the progression calls for you to lie on your back in the neutral position described in step 1 with your hands at your sides for balance. Draw your heels up. Once your heels are close to your hips, rotate your heels out wider than your knees and then sweep your heels together. Your lower legs and feet should be dorsiflexed or in an L position.

Your lower legs and feet should be dorsiflexed or in an L position. Squeeze your ankles together and point your toes while finishing the kick. Remember that these motions are more about pressure than about speed or strength. Once you complete one kick, return to the neutral position and let your momentum fade. Repeat the same motion until you are comfortable with it. Important note! You will not be able to see where you are going during this drill.

The pull The second propulsive element of the breaststroke

### Swimming STEPS TO SUCCESS_full_text.txt
pull in the breaststroke is just as important as the kick—and more important for some swimmers who are not as good at the kick portion. To develop an effective pull, it is helpful to isolate this part of the overall stroke. More specifically, the pitch of your hand and your elbow positioning are just as important here as they are in the other strokes. The elbows-up position allows you to pull with more than just your hand. Use the following drills to develop a pull with good propulsive force. Pull Drill 1 Breaststroke pull With freestyle kick This drill isolates the pull by using an easier kick and alleviating timing concerns. To perform the drill, lie on your front and kick freestyle with your hands out front. For every six kicks, perform one breaststroke pull. To increase DifficulTy • Kick faster—eight times or more per stroke. To Decrease DifficulTy • Use fins to prevent stalling. • Use a pull buoy and do not kick at all. 106 --- Page 126 Text --- Breaststroke Success Check Score Your Success • You can feel the water on both 1 point: You can go 10 yards. your hands and your forearms. 3 points: You can go 25 yards. • You can go 25 yards on your 5 points: You can go 25 yards in 10 or front in nine pulls with ease. more pulls. 7 points: You can go 25 yards in nine or fewer pulls. Pull Drill 2 Tennis Ball or fist To do this drill, hold a tennis ball in each hand or at least make sure that each hand is closed in a tight fist. Perform the same action as in the preceding drill but without using your hands as a propulsive surface. To increase DifficulTy • Kick faster—eight times

the breaststroke. To work on your timing, you can use a few simple drills that empha- size it. The secret to the breaststroke hinges on the fact that half of its propulsive force comes from the kick and the other half from the pull. The key is not to do both at the same time. The proper rhythm is one kick, one pull and breath, and a return to the stretched-out position. 109 --- Page 129 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Drills for TiMinG anD rhyThM Because propulsion in the breaststroke derives equally from the kick and the pull, it is crucial to maximize the efficiency of each element. Get it wrong and you end up being very slow. The key is to make sure that you do not kick when pulling and vice versa. The following drills include some overcorrections of typical problems but should help you separate the two movements so that you can develop a good rhythm. Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 1 Two-hippopotamus Breaststroke This is a slow drill that helps you with your timing. It is performed by pushing off of the wall in the streamlined position. Do one breaststroke kick, then wait while count- ing “one hippopotamus . . . two hippopotamus.” Next, pull and breathe as described earlier and shoot forward before kicking again. This approach teaches the indepen- dent movements of the arms and legs. To increase DifficulTy • Count to “three hippopotamus.” To Decrease DifficulTy • Use a pull buoy far above your knees and kick. Success Check Score Your Success • You can perform the drill while 1 point: You can go 10 yards. maintaining a long body line. 3 points: You can go 25 yards. • You do not move your hands 5 points: You can go 25 yards in 10

Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 2 Two kicks per stroke This classic breaststroke drill increases your awareness of timing and body posi- tion; it also helps you with balance. It is performed by simply kicking twice in the stretched-out position with your hands far forward (but not on top of each other) and kicking twice per catch–pull sequence. Keep your head down with a long neck during each pair of kicks. To increase DifficulTy • Count to “three hippopotamus.” To Decrease DifficulTy • Use a pull buoy far above your knees and kick. 110 --- Page 130 Text --- Breaststroke Success Check Score Your Success • You can perform the drill while 1 point: You can go 10 yards. maintaining a long body line. 3 points: You can go 25 yards. • You do not move your hands 5 points: You can go 25 yards in 10 or and feet at the same time. more pulls. 7 points: You can go 25 yards in 9 or fewer pulls.

BreasTsTroKe PullouT The modern breaststroke is done with what is referred to as a pullout (figure 5.4), both at the start and during each turn at the wall. To perform the pullout, the swim- mer pushes off the wall underwater (or starts from a dive) in a streamlined position. As the hands separate, they can pull all the way down to the hips just once. The swimmer is allowed to perform one dolphin kick at any time in this part. As the swimmer slows, the hands are brought up the body and close to the body to get into a breast stroke swimming position with the hands out in front. It is at this point that the stroke as described earlier actually begins. 111 --- Page 131 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 5.4 BreasTsTroke pullouT Preparation 1.

The following drill allows you to practice conserving your momentum as you come off the wall. How you perform the pull—and for how long—depends on your fitness. Pullout Drill Multiple pullouts In this drill, you repeat the pullout motion underwater multiple times to gauge the timing. To increase DifficulTy • See how fast you can travel 25 yards.

As a result, the stroke is highly rhythmic, and in order to do it well you need the lower half of your body to work independently of the upper half. This dynamic involves give and take, and there are many effective styles of breaststroke.

It was developed in the 1930s as a way to minimize the drag caused by underwater recovery of the arms in the breaststroke. Early variants of the butterfly (referred to as the butterfly breaststroke) used an over-the-water recovery with a breaststroke kick. This technique was much faster than the breaststroke but required a great deal of strength. It was not until the 1950s that the butterfly was con- sidered a separate stroke from breaststroke, and the use of a dolphin kick was added to the official competition rules governing the new stroke. As mentioned in step 5, the butterfly, like the breaststroke, is considered a “short- axis” stroke but is really a timing-and-rhythm stroke. It does involve rotating on a shorter axis (i.e., through the chest, laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes: • Good body position • Effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Acceleration throughout the stroke •

kickboard, it is time once again to put your propulsive kicking force to the test. Repeat the process just described, but this time do it without the assistance of the kickboard (figure 6.4). The goal is to kick in a streamlined position. If you were able to do so with a kickboard, then this transition should be a little easier. The new challenge here is that when you breathe, you should use the same sculling motion described earlier in step 2: Simply sweep your hands out and in rhythmically to apply enough pressure on the water to allow you to lift your head for a quick breath. Once you have mastered this technique—and it may take a few tries—it is time to move to dolphin kicking on your back. Figure 6.4 Dolphin KicK WiThouT KicKBoarD Preparation 1.

both competitive and recre- ational pool swimming. In competition, an effective turn saves race time when changing direction. For recreational and fitness swimmers, an effective turn maximizes your workout time and enhances your proficiency in the water. Every turn, regardless of the type, consists of four key elements: 1. Approach 2. Exchange 3. Streamline 4. Breakout The approach involves where, when, and how you prepare for the turn. The exchange is the point at which you transfer momentum from one direction to the opposite direction. The streamline is performed when you push off of the wall, and the breakout is where you transition from streamlining to swimming a stroke. In this step, you learn how to perform the most basic turn for recreational swimming, as well as the most advanced turns and transitions used in competitive swimming. Open Turn The most basic and functional turn is the open turn. It was used in early freestyle competitions, as well as backstroke competitions, and is a favorite among recrea- tional swimmers. In this turn, the approach (figure 7.1) is made on the front, and in competition pools it can be gauged by markings on the pool bottom. Specifically, the centerline of each lane has a T shape close to the wall that provides competitive swimmers with a target. When swimming in a pool without this kind of marking, you can take a quick look to judge distance by lifting your head out of the water. Many pools also have a spillover gutter system or a low coping that allows you to grasp the wall with your hands. 139 --- Page 159 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 7.1 Open Turn phase 1: apprOach anD eXchanGe a b Preparation 2.

--- Turns The next phase of the turn involves the push-off and streamline (figure 7.2). This is a critical part of good swimming; in fact, other than a start or dive, this is the fastest that you can move the in water without some sort of aid. As in step 1, the push-off here should be forceful; in addition, since you are on your side, you need to rotate to the correct position during the streamline. Make sure that you are underwater and parallel to the pool bottom and the surface of the water. Another key here lies in the fact that your head position controls your depth on the streamline. If you keep your chin and head down, you maintain constant depth. If you lift your head or push your chin forward, you rise toward the surface. Experi- ment with how long your streamline should be for best results. Figure 7.2 Open Turn phase 2: push-Off anD sTreaMLine Preparation Execution 1. Once you have completed the 1.

2, it is time to work on the streamline and push. This drill is performed in three stages. In the first stage, push off of the wall in a stream- lined position with your head down to control depth. The key is to push off forcefully and go as far as you can. Find markers in the pool or use another means to deter- mine where you come up each time. This is only a push and a streamline—no kick- ing or other movements. In the second stage, glide as far as you can. In the third, rotate from the side to the front while gliding and using only body control. Since you are on your side for the open turn, practice rotating from the side to the front several times.

Though competitors initially used the open turn, the flip turn has proven to be faster and more efficient. As with the other two turns, the flip turn involves four key elements. The approach in the flip turn differs from the approach in the other two turns. The exchange involves changing the position of your head and feet; in fact, you are faceup to the surface of the water, a position in which many people experience water flowing into the nose. This annoyance can be prevented by using a nose clip or by exhaling slowly through the nose throughout the turn. The streamline and breakout in the flip turn are the same as in the open turn. The backstroke is a little more complicated, but the movement is the same. After you swim under the backstroke flags and take three strokes, roll over onto your front and per- form the same freestyle turn. The streamline is on the back with no roll to the front. 154 --- Page 174 Text --- Turns Figure 7.9 fLip Turn Preparation 1. Start several yards from the wall and swim a few strokes freestyle. 2.

to perform. There is, of course, more to it. A successful flip turn depends on keeping your hands stationary and using your core for the turn. The following drills help you keep your core engaged and avoid relying on your hands and arms to manipulate the water. Flip-Turn Drill 1 kickboard The purpose of this drill is to keep your hands in the same place while doing the flip turn. To perform the drill, hold the bottom of a kickboard in each hand. Starting in the middle of the pool, lie on the water facedown with your hands and the kickboards at your sides and your palms and thumbs up. Tuck your chin to your chest and give a little dolphin kick while you bend at the waist. Throw your feet over so that you end up faceup at the top of the water with your arms above your head.

a lot of energy to the start and makes pool depth all the more important. Though traditionally performed from a starting block, this forward dive start can also be done from the side of the pool. Starting blocks may be either removable or permanently installed. They come in a variety of designs, depending on the manufacturer, but generally include a platform angled slightly forward or down toward the water. Some also include a wedge at the back, and this feature is currently considered state of the art for competitive racing blocks. Let’s turn now to the various dive starts. ForWarD or grab Start The forward or grab start (figure 8.3) can be done from the deck or from a block and is used for freestyle, breaststroke, and butterfly. To perform it, stand at the front edge of the block with your toes curled over the edge, then bend at your waist and bend your knees slightly. Next, grab the front edge of the block with both hands; it is very important to keep your neck loose and look down or only slightly forward. This is the set position, in which you should be reasonably comfortable with your center of gravity directly above your feet and ankles. As your feet leave the block, your hips, knees, and ankles should all be on the same line, parallel to the surface of the water, in order to generate maximum forward velocity. Your upper body is angled toward your entry position and your fingers are pointed directly to that spot. As your feet enter the water, you should be 2 to 2.5 feet (0.6-0.75 m) under the sur- face. It will take several attempts to find your ideal depth, which depends on which stroke you are swimming and what is most comfortable to you.

are pointed directly to that spot. As your feet enter the water, you should be 2 to 2.5 feet (0.6-0.75 m) under the sur- face. It will take several attempts to find your ideal depth, which depends on which stroke you are swimming and what is most comfortable to you. After your feet enter the water, you are in the streamline phase. Perform this part of the start as described in the stroke-specific step chapters. 164 --- Page 184 Text --- Starts Remember that at the instant you enter the water, you are traveling at the fast- est speed you will achieve in your swim. Therefore, it is crucial to achieve a tight streamline in order to avoid slowing down and to minimize drag. The streamline for freestyle and butterfly involves powerful kicking at very high frequency, whereas the breaststroke streamline involves the breaststroke pullout. The breakout, once again, is the transition from streamlining to swimming. In all of these strokes, the first few strokes after the streamline are crucial for maintaining the momentum you generated in the start and the streamline. To do so, focus on making your first few strokes powerful and flawless. Figure 8.3 ForWarD or grab Start a bb Set 3. At the same time, bring your hands forward toward the stream- 1.

Which foot is the best foot to put forward? To answer this question, use the fol- lowing simple methods. First, have a partner or your coach stand behind you. Stand with your own feet together, close your eyes, and have the other person gently push you forward. Whichever leg moves first to stop you from falling is your dominant leg. This fact alone, however, does not make it the best foot to put forward. 169 --- Page 189 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Next, have the other person observe whether your hips are back or forward in your set position. People whose hips sit a little back tend to be faster on the start when they put the dominant leg forward; those whose hips sit forward tend to do better with the nondominant leg forward. In either case, your feet should point straight down the pool rather than at any kind of angle. Ultimately, of course, the only way to tell for sure which approach is right for you is to try them out and see which one gets you farther down the pool.

Remember that the instant you enter the water, you are traveling at the fastest speed you will achieve in your swim.

In all of these swimming strokes, your first few strokes after the streamline are crucial for maintaining the momentum you generated in the start and the streamline. To do so, focus on making your first few strokes powerful and flawless. In addition, this particular type of start involves a few more variables that must be managed. Whether you have your hips forward or back, your timing, and the amount of verti- cal force you put into the start all influence the entry. If your feet do not enter through the same hole in the water as the rest of the body, you may twist, which will influence the way you streamline. You may have to make adjustments with your body and in your streamline to ensure that you can manage the breakout effectively. MISStep You look up, lose your balance, and fall in.

and the start (figure 8.5) is no exception. The backstroke start can be performed from the deck or a block; either way, it is done in the water with the feet on the wall and the back facing down the pool. For the entry, push off and do a back “dive,” which brings you underwater and sets up the streamline. An effective backstroke start begins, of course, with the set. Competitive blocks are outfitted with grab bars for backstroke, but even then some swimmers opt to use the deck. The set is performed by placing the feet flat on the wall with the elbows bent. Next comes the push, for which the key is timing. The result should be almost a back dive. The most efficient swimmers follow an arc and their feet go from under the water to out of the water and then back through the same hole that the upper body goes through. Strong swimmers get the entire body out of the water at some point and basically go through the same hole as the hands. Depth on the entry differs from that of the chest-down strokes. In the backstroke, the streamline and the dolphin kick are important elements. In fact, one of the fastest recorded backstroke swims was done mostly on an underwater streamline with a dolphin kick. With this in mind, if you are a good dolphin kicker, it works to your advantage to go deeper and longer on the entry. In competition, your streamline is allowed to extend for a maximum of 15 yards. Experiment to find out which head and body positions produce the best streamline for you while keeping you underwa- ter for the correct amount of streamline. Since you are faceup, it is likely that water will go up your nose

The most common way is to use a horizontal sculling motion with the hands while breaststroke-kicking with one leg at a time. This kick is commonly referred to as the eggbeater. People who struggle with the breaststroke kick can use a version of the flutter kick just as effectively. Either of these kicks can be used for this drill. The drill helps you prepare for times when you are stationary in the water and cannot push off of the bottom to get started. To do the drill, perform a sculling action with your hands in front to keep yourself stationary, then kick your legs and hips up to the surface. You must arch your back to keep your head out of the water, but once you are ready to go, just put your face in and start swimming.

stationary object to assure you that you are swimming straight (figure 9.4). Here are a few skills and drills to help you ensure that you swim in the right direction. Figure 9.4 In open-water swimming, it’s best to use a prominent landmark when sighting and navigating. PreParation 1. Find a pool with an open lane that measures at least 25 yards. 2. At one end of the pool, stand directly on top of the lane stripe. execution 1. Begin swimming freestyle and go for 10 strokes (each arm movement counts as one stroke) with your eyes closed. 2. Stop after 10 strokes and put your feet down. If you are still directly on top of the line, then you probably swim fairly straight and do not need to sight as much as some swimmers do. 3. If, on the other hand, you were bouncing off of the lane line to one side or the other, depending on overcorrections, you may want to review the freestyle step to adjust this pulling to one side and sight more frequently. miSStep You are exhausted after 25 yards of swimming. COrreCtiOn You are probably sighting too often. Doing so causes you to start and stop, which takes more energy. Sight a little less often. 192 --- Page 212 Text --- Open-Water and Survival Swimming miSStep You end up way off course.

for at least one stroke. Perhaps sight a little more frequently and compensate if you find yourself tending to pull to one side. SWitCh drillS The following drills help you not only with sighting during a competition but also with engaging various muscles in a survival situation. The key in both cases is to perform the skills with minimal energy expenditure. Switch Drill 1 Freestyle-to-Breaststroke Switch As mentioned in step 5, the breaststroke is the slowest of the competitive strokes but offers some advantages. Aside from getting to breathe on every stroke, you also get to look forward, which of course is very helpful when you need to quickly check where you’re going while continuing to make progress. In short, the breaststroke allows you to simultaneously get a peek—for example, at a buoy or landmark—and a little air. To perform this drill, swim seven strokes of freestyle followed by three strokes of breaststroke and then go back to freestyle. tO inCreaSe diFFiCulty • Swim multiple cycles of the drill. tO deCreaSe diFFiCulty • Stop after each switch.

First, you get to breathe for a bit with your face out of the water so that you can also clear your goggles or rest tired muscles used in the freestyle. Second, you can sneak a look back and see where you have been to track progress and check heading. To perform this drill, swim seven strokes of freestyle, then roll over and swim three strokes of backstroke before returning to freestyle. During one of the freestyle strokes it is okay to lift your head to see your competition or (in competition or sur- vival situations) to see where you have been in order to judge the current. tO inCreaSe diFFiCulty • Swim multiple cycles of the drill. tO deCreaSe diFFiCulty • Stop after each switch.

simply press down slightly during the catch so that only your goggles break the surface, thus allowing you to get a quick peek. The breath is still taken in a separate movement from the peek to the side. The drill allows you to figure out the best height for your goggles and find your rhythm. First, take three strokes and then lift your head completely out of the water, making sure that even your chin comes out. Repeat this sequence for 25 yards. Now do the drill again but this time lift your head until just your mouth and nose are out of the water. Then try it with just your goggles coming out. You should notice that surfing just the goggles is easier and prevents you from stopping in the water. In each itera- tion, after you take your sighting, press your chest down to regain horizontal equi- librium and avoid having to kick your way back to horizontal. This undulating motion also maintains your momentum. How often do you need to look? You should have a pretty good idea of your answer to this question if you did the eyes-closed exercise for navigation and sight- ing described earlier. Try it some more to make sure that you know what works best for you. 194 --- Page 214 Text --- Open-Water and Survival Swimming tO inCreaSe diFFiCulty • Swim multiple cycles of the drill without stopping.

Pack swim- ming (figure 9.5) involves a lot of contact and often leaves very little space in the water for just you. As in cycling, the pack moves as a group, and everyone tries to find the right spot in which to gain an advantage. Also as in cycling, drafting gives swimmers a little extra lift and makes the work a bit easier. Another benefit is that you get to let someone else navigate—assuming he or she swims straight! Unlike in cycling, the ideal swimming draft is done to the side and back rather than directly behind. To get the idea, think of how geese fly. Aim to have your head somewhere between the lead swimmer’s hip and her or his ankle; the exact position- ing depends on the swimmer’s size, shape, velocity, and swim conditions. Figure 9.5 When swimming in a pack, you will come into contact with other swimmers, so it’s important to learn how to draft. 195 --- Page 215 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success To perform this technique, you and a friend or instructor both leave the wall, the friend or instructor leaving first.

or instructor both leave the wall, the friend or instructor leaving first. Find the spot where your freestyle stroke is long and smooth as described in the positioning previously. In the boundary layer between fluids and other materials, the velocities shed by and object provide vectors of force in a variety of directions. If you can minimize the energy while maintaining a velocity by making your strokes long and smooth, then you have found a good drafting posi- tion. Try both the right and left sides until you determine which one you like best. PreParation 1. Find two swimmers to help you with this skill. 2. Make sure that you have a free lane in which to practice the skill. 3. Ensure that no swimmers are coming the other way. execution 1. Have the first swimmer start by swimming down the center of the lane. 2. After waiting a second or two, the second and third swimmers can start at the same time on either side. 3. The draft position is slightly to the side, much like geese use when flying in an echelon formation. 4. The best draft position is with the head somewhere between the lead swim- mer’s hip and ankle. 5. Adjust your draft position forward and backward in this zone until you can feel the benefit of the draft. miSStep You end up getting splashed in the face and constantly swallow water. COrreCtiOn Switch sides. miSStep You get kicked in the face by the lead swimmer.

To per- form the drill, start by rolling inward and taking one backstroke stroke in a twisting motion. As your backstroke arm reaches for the catch, your body width matches that of the lead swimmer, and after completing the roll, your next stroke is on the opposite side. In other words, depending on which side you start on, you either do a back- stroke with your left hand and roll to the front with a right-hand stroke, or vice versa. This maneuver puts you on the other side of the lead swimmer’s feet without losing momentum. It is a little tricky, and you should practice it in a pool before trying it in an open-water environment. tO inCreaSe diFFiCulty • Swim at least 75 yards without stopping. tO deCreaSe diFFiCulty • Stop after each 25 yards. • Wear fins.

Changing direCtiOn Most open-water swims require you to turn or at least change direction. Doing so without losing momentum is an art form. When swimming freestyle, the human body is just not meant to bend laterally very much; humans are much better at bend- ing forward at the waist. Having said that, one of the more effective turns involves taking one backstroke stroke and bending at the waist so that your upper body points in the direction in which you want to go after the turn. Your legs will follow. This technique allows you to change direction without breaking rhythm, and swimmers who can touch their toes can use it to make as much as a 180-degree direction change. Another effective turn is the one-arm turn, which is a little more conservative and flat. To perform it, extend your inside arm in front of you and position the palm of that hand vertically so that it acts like a rudder. Use your other arm to stroke until you finish the turn. Your inside arm is closer to the buoy, and your stroking arm is farther from it. 198 --- Page 218 Text --- Open-Water and Survival Swimming Follow these steps to practice changing directions. PreParation 1. Find a wide part of the pool. 2. Use a makeshift buoy (e.g., a balloon anchored to the bottom) or have a fellow swimmer stand in shallower water to act as a buoy. execution 1. Start at least 15 yards away from the buoy. 2. Begin swimming freestyle and sight the buoy at least once. 3. After reaching the buoy, bring your hands together out front. 4. With your inside

After reaching the buoy, bring your hands together out front. 4. With your inside arm extended, turn your hand to a vertical position. 5. Pont the fingers of that hand in the direction in which you want to go. 6. Stroke quickly with your opposite arm. 7. Once the turn is complete, continue swimming as usual. miSStep You have to stop at the buoy or turn around to go in the opposite direction. COrreCtiOn Remember that it takes more energy to get going again after stop- ping, so even if your turn is wide just keep swimming. miSStep You get squeezed out of a turn by a leading swimmer.

FiniSh and exit Whether you are finishing and exiting a race or swimming in a survival situation, it is critical to conserve energy. Swimmers who are accustomed to using an energy-con- serving two-beat kick often find that the body directs all of its energy resources to the muscles doing the most work in the upper body. For this reason, competitive open-water swimmers and triathletes alike often experience cramping in the lower body and a lack of balance upon getting back on dry land. With this risk in mind, it is important to get circulation and resources flowing to the lower body as well— regardless of how you get out of the water, you will need to use your legs to walk or run. Another hazard arises for many competitive swimmers and triathletes after they round the final buoy. At this point, they make a mad dash for the shore without thinking much about sighting, which may cause them to waste

the water, you will need to use your legs to walk or run. Another hazard arises for many competitive swimmers and triathletes after they round the final buoy. At this point, they make a mad dash for the shore without thinking much about sighting, which may cause them to waste energy by swimming too far due to poor navigation. It is also important at this stage to maintain rhythm to prevent swimming too far or going into oxygen debt before the end of the race, forcing you to back off the pace. exiting the Water Exits will vary depending on the course some are ramp exits while others are just shore approaches. The exit is similar to the entry in a few ways. The first is that you have to make sure you have a target to reach. Knowing where the finish is and about what the distance from the last turn is will be helpful here. Next is the fact that kicking is important. In the beginning of an open water race, many swimmers use a high kick tempo to create separation from the pack. After- wards, they may settle into a slower two- or four-beat kick to save energy. The prob- lem with this is that much of the body’s resources get concentrated in the upper body as the legs do not require as much. It is important to remember to pick up the kick to increase the blood flow to the lower extremities. 201 --- Page 221 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success miSStep You run up onto the beach and immediately experience leg cramps. COrreCtiOn Make sure to kick your legs to get more blood circulating back into them during the last part of the swim. miSStep You have to stop before getting to the exit

legs are wide apart and the swimmer is on his or her side. To perform the scis- sor kick, bring the leg that is closer to the surface forward by drawing the knee toward your chest. The leg that is closer to the bottom of the pool extends back so that you are almost in a stridelike position on your side. Next, bring your legs together while extending the leg that was drawn to the chest. As you wedge yourself forward, you should feel the pressure on the back of your top leg and on the front of your bottom leg. 203 --- Page 223 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 9.7 SideStrOke kiCk Preparation 1.

Complete Sidestroke The process of putting it all together for the sidestroke is very similar to the process for the breaststroke in that your arm and leg movements must be somewhat inde- pendent. The most effective use of the powerful kick is to perform it while you are extended, with your lead arm out, so be patient. While your legs recover to kick again, your momentum should be maintained by the propulsive force of the pull and armstroke. Do the following to practice the complete sidestroke. PreParation 1. Make sure that you have adequate space to do the stroke. 2. Get into the water and lie on your front in the neutral position. execution 1.

In addition, your face is always out of the water, which enables you to breathe easily. The stroke is performed by incorporating an arm push and a breaststroke kick while lying on your back. Unlike the breaststroke, this stroke involves nearly simultaneous arm and leg movements. Make sure that your arms stay in the water the whole time. When practicing this stroke in a pool, make sure that the backstroke flags are in place or have a

Be sure to push in a sweeping motion toward your thighs. miSStep You kick out with your legs and draw your knees up too high. COrreCtiOn This motion causes water to rush up to your face and provides you with little or no propulsion.
