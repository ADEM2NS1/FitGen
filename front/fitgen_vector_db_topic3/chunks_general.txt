one smooth movement, with your hand accelerating toward the end of the pull. It’s useful, though, to separate the underwater action into three phases: • Catch, in which your arm moves into a position in which it can start to add significant propulsion. • In-sweep, in which your elbow is held high, bent at 90°, and your hand sweeps in toward the edge of your body • Out-sweep, when having swept inward your hand comes out again, and leaves the water with your thumb close to or brushing your thigh. Some swimmers prefer to simplify the arm-pull action and pull straight back using a high-elbow position rather than separating the second part of the stroke into an in-sweep and out-sweep. (The roll of their body means they are not actually likely to be pulling back in a straight line.) If you find the arm pull --- Page 67 Text --- action tricky, this straight-back pulling action may be a better option. Be aware, though, that you do need a good streamlined position and roll in your stroke for this to work well. THE CATCH The catch is important because getting it right sets up the rest of your stroke. It is the transition into the most powerful part of the arm stroke, which actually drives you forward. The crucial thing to remember is that you should keep your elbow high, using it as a pivot to swing your hand down and back. To most people, the high-elbow position feels a bit unnatural at first. Because of this, it’s worth taking a bit of time to rebuild your arm stroke from the ground up. The straight-arms scull and bent-arms scull drills that follow are the starting point, and allow you to get a feel for the water using a high-elbow position.

will emerge. I also find swimming blind is a useful way of concentrating on how your stroke feels. It’s amazing how much easier it is to sense the effectiveness of your arm pull, or the degree of water resistance you’re experiencing, with your eyes shut. Start by swimming along above a line on the bottom of the pool. Initially, just close your eyes for three or four strokes before opening them to check where you are. As your feel for how to swim straight with your eyes shut improves, you’ll probably be able to keep them closed for longer periods. This exercise is excellent for open-water swimmers, who need to be able to swim straight without sighting on the bottom of a pool or by looking at lane lines. As an illustration, World Open-Water Swimmer of the Year 2009 and 2011 Keri-Anne Payne attributes part of her success to the fact that she learnt to swim without goggles, couldn’t really see where she was going and had to develop a feel for swimming in a straight line. WATCH YOURSELF --- Page 134 Text --- A friend of mine once told me that she’d been terribly upset at some photos of herself at a wedding. ‘I don’t look like that! That woman’s shorter and rounder than me. I look like Lana Turner.’ The terrible truth is, of course, that we rarely look as we imagine. As a result, most people’s swimming improves when they get a chance to watch themselves swim. They immediately see where their stroke differs from a really expert swimmer’s. Filming swimming The ideal scenario is for a friend to film you swimming. This is likely to be impossible in a public pool, as they generally don’t allow cameras. If you can get access to a private pool,

a big area of water to work with. You can swim along the edges, between the corners in an X shape, in a Z pattern ... wherever you imagination (or your coach) leads you. Even if some of the pool is taken up with other swimmers and you can only get a couple of lanes, a pair of turn buoys allows you similar training options. TRAINING FOR OPEN WATER The key difference between pool and open-water swimming is the lack of turns. In a 25-metre pool you rarely actually swim more than 20m at a time. Then you get a push off the wall, which gives you a chance to break the swim. In an open- water event, you may swim a kilometre or more without interrupting your rhythm. If you don’t practise for it, this comes as quite a shock. Pool training It sounds obvious, but before you enter a 1km or 1.5km open water swim, you --- OCR from Page 166 Image 1 --- > —&—=-_ Swim direction > > => =p dP > Swim directi > e. wim direction —> > 00.0 0,910 6 0.0 6 0 08 0 8 8 OS oe 6 8 8 8 eg ee > > JO SU“ 0 Ce 88 6 16 Cee ee ee eee ee ee Fe ee > > @ 0 16 0,8) 0 6 6 6 0.10 6 Oe 0 8 8 68 8 8 6 8 8 et ee Oe > > Backstroke flags Backstroke flags <—= Swim direction Length 3 Length Swim direction —> I SL PD EL Backstroke flags Backstroke flags --- Page 167 Text --- need to make sure you can swim that distance continuously.

the tough nuts, among the tough world of open-water racing. The competitors had to swim through large blooms of jellyfish, and some of the favourites failed even to finish. It’s an extreme example, but it does show that open-water swimmers need to be ready to face unexpected challenges, including waves, boat exhaust fumes, seaweed, fog and tidal currents. OPEN-WATER SWIMS If you’ve never done an open-water swim event before, it can be a bit daunting. Before the event, consider where to position yourself and how to get the most from your swim. This depends to some extent on your aims. If you want to compete at the front, you’ll be mixing it with a bunch of ambitious, sharp- elbowed swimmers. If you want simply to enjoy the swim and finish feeling you’ve done well, a more relaxed approach will work better. --- Page 170 Text --- Starts Swims often begin with a massed start. The racers will try to position themselves wherever they have the shortest route to the first turn buoy. When the starter’s hooter goes, this area will be a churning maelstrom of arms and legs, as people sprint to get clear water and a good position. If you’d prefer a more leisurely start, either move off to the side or let the competitive swimmers get going for a few seconds, then swim behind them. Turns Turns offer competitive swimmers a golden opportunity to take time out of other racers. Turning as close as possible to the buoy, without losing speed, can gain you several metres. Of course, that means the area close to the turn buoy becomes a pinch point: if you’re not competing, and want only to enjoy your swim, you may think it’s a better idea to give the buoy a wider berth.

created Swim Smooth in 2004. Still, here we are, almost exactly seven years since we produced the very first Swim Smooth DVD and with a piece of work of which I am extremely proud. However, none of this work would have been possible without the help, guidance and inspiration of quite a few key people in my life. I was always told by my mum (Linda) at swimming competitions to do my best and that no one else could ever ask any more from me than that. Given that I knew quite a lot of kids with very pushy parents when I was in my pre-teens, this advice certainly helped seal my love for the sport of swimming as a keen interest rather than something I was forced into. My mum’s devotion to taking me training every morning and every night and suspending her own interests out of commitment to my own passion was totally selfless and something I can only dream of aspiring to with my children. Thanks Mum – this book is for you. Paul Newsome I read two very inspiring and thought-provoking books just prior to commencing work on this project, which got me thinking about my own development as an athlete and now a coach. The first, Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell, says that to excel in any field, one must accumulate at least 10,000 hours of practical experience and sound application of those experiences. When I emigrated to Perth in Western Australia I was fortunate enough to find a hub of swimming activity for all levels, ages and backgrounds far surpassing anywhere else in the world. With more 50m pools per head of population than anywhere else on the planet, and a multitude of fantastic open water swimming venues, I found myself immersed in a swimming

Swimming coaching is notoriously ‘system’ oriented and the large majority of successful coaches tend to work for local, state or national governing bodies who are able to support and assist with funding and salaries. Unfortunately this approach has never been for me as I have always preferred to have the freedom to do things my way and in a manner that I believe in–devoid of politics and committee decisions. With freedom, though, comes risk as a self-employed coach, and without doubt I have to credit this entrepreneurial

We hope that our recently appointed status as coaching consultants to the British Triathlon, and our work with the thousands of coaches worldwide who share our philosophy, will aid this effort further. The world needs better swimming. Thanks also to Giles O’Brien and Paul Moss at the British Triathlon for seeking our help with the British Triathlon coaching programme and to Miles Kendall, Andrew Kennerley and all the publishing team at John Wiley & Sons Ltd. who have allowed this dream to come to fruition by approaching us to produce this body of work you have in your hands right now. And, finally, a massive thanks to my wife Michelle and my children Jackson and Isla who have supported me through all of the hard work and devotion to my swim coaching career. I have to sacrifice much on a daily basis to do what I do and I often wonder if a nine-to-five job would be a better pursuit in this respect. However, this just wouldn’t be me and I have massive respect for Michelle recognising this within me. Michelle has been there from the very start of Swim Smooth: from the very early days travelling around the UK and Europe in our Swim Smooth camper van trying desperately hard to fill clinic places, to now selling out clinic places around the world within a couple of hours of date release.

rate on the internet and in academic papers might refer to stroke cycles per minute – one cycle being the combination of a left and right arm stroke. In this situation 30 cycles per minute is equivalent to 60 strokes per minute. Some sources also refer to cycle time in seconds (a stroke cycle taking 2.0 seconds to complete would also be the equivalent of 60 SPM). What we really like about strokes per minute is a) we are always dealing with whole numbers and not decimals and b) when using a stroke rate beeper the swimmer can coordinate each hand entry into the water with the beep which helps identify issues in symmetry between left and right. Swimming Speed is normally quoted as the time taken to cover a given distance. This could be time per 400 m or 1000 m but most commonly speed is quoted in time per 100 m swum in minutes and seconds. So 1:30/100 m means every 100 m swum is taking you one and a half minutes to complete. An elite swimmer might sprint at 0:50/100 m and slow down to 1:00–1:05/100 m over longer distances (if you can call that slow!). What we call ‘advanced’ swimmers will fall in the range of 1:10–1:30/100 m for continuous swims. ‘Intermediate’ age- group swimmers will be in the range of 1:30–2:10/100 m with beginners taking up to 3:00/100 m. The Pool Pace Clock is a special swimming clock that is well worth learning to use. It does not have a minute hand, just a double second hand coloured red in one direction and black in the other. Elite swimmers do not wear a watch when they swim, instead they use the pace clock to time all their sets – with practice you can learn to

It does not have a minute hand, just a double second hand coloured red in one direction and black in the other. Elite swimmers do not wear a watch when they swim, instead they use the pace clock to time all their sets – with practice you can learn to time any distance of swim using just the second hands of this clock. The key to doing this is knowing approximately what time you will swim for any distance. For instance, you might know that you can swim 400 m in close to eight minutes. If you set off when the red hand reaches the 12 o’clock position (jargon ‘going on the red top’) then you should finish when the red hand is near the top again. So, if you finish with the red hand on 10 seconds you swam 8:10, or on the 45 seconds, you swam 7:45. This is beneficial because many swimmers find that wearing a standard watch disrupts their ‘feel for the water’ by disturbing the water flow on your arm. Also, when swimming repetitions you can use the pace clock to set you off. For instance you could swim 100 m repetitions starting every 2:15 and so start the first on ‘black top’, the second on ‘black 15’, the third on ‘black 30’ etc. This is a simple way of swimming sets without having to look at your watch and do lots of mental arithmetic! A ‘Torpedo Push-Off’ or ‘Streamline’ is a position adopted by swimmers as they push off from the wall. This position has a very low level of drag, lower than when swimming normally. The quickest way to swim is to push off from the wall and hold this streamlined position until the speed drops to normal swimming speed and then ‘break-out’

for. Californian swimming technology company Finis is one of the most innovative companies in this area and for this reason we have tried and tested all of its products, our favourite ones of which feature prominently below. Other manufacturers making good swim gear and training aids are Speedo, TYR, Aquasphere, and Arena. Depending upon your location, you may see that some of these brands are more prominent than others. Essential Equipment 1. Bathers/Cossie/Costume/Trunks/Togs/Speedos/Budgie Smugglers – whatever you call them it’s essential to be suitably attired in the swimming pool and ocean! A well fitting swimming costume can make all the difference to how well you slip through the water. Of course you can wear whatever you like to protect your modesty but at Swim Smooth we have a preference towards brightly coloured bathers made by Funky Trunks, Aqua Diva and Speedo as they are a little bit fun and help to brighten up a cold winter’s morning! 2. Swimming Cap and Goggles – silicon swimming caps are our recommendation as they are very durable and don’t pull at your hair like the cheaper latex caps tend to. A good cap will also keep your head warm in the open water and help --- Page 34 Text --- streamline your progress. Caps and goggles are made by a range of manufacturers but our favourite goggles are made by Canadian company ‘Sable’ (www.sablewateroptics.com) as they provide a great fit, come with a variety of different nose bridges for custom modification and have excellent clarity and anti- fog properties. We recommend that female swimmers with small faces try out junior size goggles for a better fit. Goggle clarity in the open water is essential and will make you feel much more comfortable in this environment. 3. Fins/Flippers – these are excellent tools to

should roll to the other end and make a ‘toc’ sound. If you are not rotating well enough it will remain silent! 11. Swimming watches by Finis, Garmin and Swimovate – great for gadget lovers everywhere! These sophisticated devices use accelerometers to be able to tell each time you take a stroke, when you reach the end of the pool and when you turn to come back. By recording this data for subsequent review, the swimmer is able to build up a very clear picture of how well they are pacing themselves. All watches contain an algorithm to calculate a ‘SWOLF score’ which is based on the ‘swim golf’ idea that if you add the number of strokes taken in a given length to the time in seconds to complete that length, you will have an index of ‘efficiency’ with the theory being that the lower the score, the more efficient the swimmer. Specialist swimming watches allow you to review and study every lap you swam in the pool. Great for those who love a bit of analysis! --- Page 38 Text --- As you will read in the rest of this book, SWOLF scores are not always a true indication of actual swimming efficiency and for this reason Swim Smooth tend not to use this measure as it can predispose people to overly lengthening their strokes. The Garmin 910 XT watch also contains a GPS receiver, which allows you to use the watch in the open water and check how far and how straight you have swum. Not Recommended 12. Board Shorts – many novice male swimmers think that figure hugging bathers should only be worn by more serious ‘professional’ swimmers but nothing could be further from the truth! Baggy shorts add a huge amount of drag and pull

stroke rate precisely. The Finis Tempo Trainer Pro sits under your swim cap and beeps a steady stroke rhythm to you. These stroke beepers are particularly useful for helping you subtly raise or lower your stroke rate. If you have a tendency to fight the water with a large crossover in your stroke then to help you become straighter and more aligned in the water it’s worthwhile lowering your natural stroke rate by 3–5 SPM. For an Overglider who is working on removing the dead spot from their stroke it’s more appropriate to lift your stroke rate by 3–5 SPM. PAUL: Judging your stroke rate whilst you are swimming can be quite difficult without a Wetronome or Tempo Trainer to refer to. They are fantastic little devices and come highly recommended by the Swim Smooth team. You can find out more about them at www.swimsmooth.com/wetronome and www.swimsmooth.com/tempotrainer The Stroke Rate Ramp Test A ramp test uses a stroke rate beeper to take you through a range of stroke rates in turn. You might start 10 SPM slower than your natural stroke rate and end up 15–20 SPM higher. You will need a friend or coach to help you with the test and record the results as you go, including your strokes per length, your lap times and how hard each stroke rate felt. The test helps you find sweet-spots in your stroke rate where the movements start to click together into good timing. At these points you will be moving more quickly and easily than you otherwise would. Very often you will find two sweet-spots, one at a steady pace and one at a faster race-pace. We highly recommend running through a ramp test after working on your stroke to help ‘bed in’ the changes. Find out how to run

Find out how to run the test, how to analyse the results and see a video example at: www.swimsmooth.com/ramptest. --- Page 117 Text --- CHAPTER 14 Stroke Rate Development Balancing Stroke Rate and Stroke Length This chapter is a special feature on the methods required to increase stroke rate, this is an area that Overgliders need to work on and to some extent Smooths too if they are looking to make a successful transition to racing in open water. However, it is important to emphasise here that not all swimmers need to lift their stroke rate – some need to be lengthening out their stroke instead (e.g. Arnies) and in this case it is often advisable to lower stroke rate a little to help achieve this. Fundamentally, the speed you move through the water is a combination of the length of your stroke and your stroke rate. We can use a simple equation to show this: swimming speed = stroke length × stroke rate At either extreme a swimmer becomes inefficient: with a low stroke rate you overglide and lose too much speed; increase stroke rate too high and you start to fight the water. The key to becoming an efficient swimmer is to find the sweet-spot in the middle where your stroke movements and stroke rhythm click into perfect harmony. This exact point varies significantly from swimmer to swimmer depending on your build, fitness and individual stroke style. The Swim Type stroke correction processes in Appendix B are designed to lower or raise your

the sweet-spot in the middle where your stroke movements and stroke rhythm click into perfect harmony. This exact point varies significantly from swimmer to swimmer depending on your build, fitness and individual stroke style. The Swim Type stroke correction processes in Appendix B are designed to lower or raise your stroke rate as appropriate and find this efficiency ‘sweet spot’ in your stroke. ADAM: Take a look ahead to Figure 14.13 The Swim Smooth Stroke Rate Chart later in this chapter, which highlights how some swimmers are over-revving and fighting the water (the red zone) while others are adding a large dead spot to their timing (the blue zone). For swimmers in the blue zone, raising stroke rate presents a difficult challenge especially if they have a heavily imprinted dead spot in their stroke timing. This chapter is dedicated to helping those swimmers lift their stroke rate. Stroke Rate and Open Water Swimming As we shall discuss later in Chapter 33, swimming in open water is very different from the pool. The disturbed water from waves, chop and the wake from other swimmers means that any dead spots or pauses in your stroke leave you vulnerable to being stalled completely between strokes. For this reason, the trade-off between stroke length and --- Page 118 Text --- stroke rate is always shifted towards shorter faster strokes in open water. If you feel the need to lift your stroke rate in open water then use the advice in this chapter to do that. Lifting Stroke Rate In a nutshell, the way to lift stroke rate is to remove dead spots or pauses from the stroke timing and so get into the catch phase a little sooner. However, many swimmers struggle to raise their stroke rate without significantly increasing their level of effort.

that. Lifting Stroke Rate In a nutshell, the way to lift stroke rate is to remove dead spots or pauses from the stroke timing and so get into the catch phase a little sooner. However, many swimmers struggle to raise their stroke rate without significantly increasing their level of effort. There are two main reasons for this: 1. The dead spot in their stroke timing is very imprinted and hard to remove. When trying to lift stroke rate, the swimmer increases the speed of every other movement of the stroke but keeps the dead spot in place. This increases effort levels but does not improve efficiency. 2. The swimmer has a large press downward on the water during the catch phase of the stroke. This acts to lift the front end of the body upwards and sink the legs. As the swimmer tries to increase stroke rate they press down harder on the water and so sink the legs, increasing drag. This increase in drag offsets any gains in efficiency from a more continuous stroke. Such swimmers often feel their swimming is very ‘one paced’ – increasing effort does not increase their speed very much at all. The key to lifting your stroke rate is twofold: 1. Improve the timing of your stroke so that you remove the glide and dead spot whilst keeping all the other stroke elements the same speed. This will improve efficiency with very little, if any, increase in effort. As you swim the sensation here will be to keep the lead hand constantly in motion, either extending forwards, catching the water or pressing it backwards. Never pausing and gliding! 2. Improve your catch mechanics so that you press the water backwards, not downward. This will be a quicker action as water is heavy and takes

will be to keep the lead hand constantly in motion, either extending forwards, catching the water or pressing it backwards. Never pausing and gliding! 2. Improve your catch mechanics so that you press the water backwards, not downward. This will be a quicker action as water is heavy and takes time to change its direction. By pressing it backwards you are helping the water in the direction it is already travelling relative to you and this will take less time – thereby increasing stroke rate all by itself. As effort is increased, your stroke rate will lift further as the downward press and resultant drag has been removed. Age-group swimmer Paul (top) is about to press down on the water with a straight arm in comparison to elite open water swimmer Mel Benson (bottom) who has bent her elbow and is pressing water backwards. --- Page 119 Text --- To develop your catch mechanics and remove your dead spot follow the process in Chapter 13 and also the relevant Swim Type stroke correction process in Appendix B. You Are Not Looking to Shorten the Stroke It is very important to appreciate that by lifting stroke rate you are not shortening the stroke at all, you are still starting from the front of the stroke at full extension and finishing at the thigh at the rear. Instead of shortening the stroke you are simply looking to remove the delay pre-catch. In Figure 14.12 there are some photos of elite open water swimmer Melissa Benson swimming at around 100 strokes per minute – if you have ever used a stroke rate beeper you will know this is a very high stroke rate! Whilst it is unlikely you will want such a high stroke rate yourself, even in this extreme example you can

Whilst it is unlikely you will want such a high stroke rate yourself, even in this extreme example you can clearly see Mel is not shortening her stroke, she is starting at full reach and completing the stroke at the thigh. FIGURE 14.12 Elite swimmer Mel Benson has a very high stroke rate but still uses her full reach from full extension (1) to the finishing at the thigh (2). --- Page 120 Text --- PAUL: I took a swimmer for a video analysis session in late 2010 who I often refer to when discussing the balance between stroke rate and stroke length, and the perils of over-gliding. This swimmer told me that he couldn’t understand why he could swim a single 50 m lap in 28 strokes (which he added was ‘better than Ian Thorpe’) but was not able to break 25 minutes for 1000 m. He also complained of being fatigued at the end of each lap and needing a rest. What was most confusing was that this guy was tall, had a good swimmer’s build and had been swimming four times per week for over five years and wasn’t seeing any improvement – in fact he told me he was actually getting slower. What he didn’t appreciate at that point was that whilst his stroke was very long, his stroke rate was an incredibly slow 33 strokes per minute. He paused for over a second at the front of the stroke and said he enjoyed this pause to glide as it was giving him a ‘rest’. Unfortunately this ‘rest’ was causing him to decelerate to a near

long, his stroke rate was an incredibly slow 33 strokes per minute. He paused for over a second at the front of the stroke and said he enjoyed this pause to glide as it was giving him a ‘rest’. Unfortunately this ‘rest’ was causing him to decelerate to a near stop between strokes and so causing him to start to sink in the water. He was shocked when he saw just how badly this was affecting his body position – something he thought must have been OK from all the balance drills he had been working on. Whilst we often look at swimmers like Ian Thorpe and perceive a long, slow stroke, the reality is that Thorpe swam at 72 to 76 SPM – well over twice that of my extreme Overglider example. Clearly this guy was not better than Ian Thorpe despite his stroke being longer – something we have all been told in the past is the key measure of swimming efficiency. The truth is that stroke length is only part of the full picture and neither stroke length nor stroke rate should ever be taken in isolation. Dead spots and Stroke Rate in Numbers Let’s look at the three swimmers who need to lift their stroke rate in Table 14.2.

don’t know what I’m actually doing or how to improve it!’ Please note: in most pools around the world strict regulations make it is essential to have prior permission to use any sort of recording equipment. Always ask permission first, in many cases it may only be possible in a private booking or club session. Camera Hardware If you are going to the trouble of filming your stroke we highly recommend using a camera that will allow you to film below the water as well as above. Being able to see what you look like under the water is incredibly beneficial, above the water the distorting properties of the surface can give a very deceptive view. In fact, it is fair to say that the view from above water is normally much more flattering than that seen from below the surface.

Proudly representing Great Britain in 2000. --- Page 144 Text --- There was never any doubt in my mind that the one thing that I wanted to do after completing my Sports Science degree at Bath University was to coach swimming and triathlon. I wanted to work primarily with adult age-group athletes of limited swimming experience and put my biomechanics knowledge and video analysis skills to best use by helping these swimmers improve their efficiency in the water. As it turned out everything fell into place a little sooner than I thought it might. Whilst on a backpacking trip in 2002 (complete with long, bleached-blonde hair and hippy clothing) I found myself in sunny Perth and was offered a job as the Head Coach for the largest triathlon club in Western Australia. The Challenge Stadium Aquatic Centre was to be my base and with three 50 m pools all in one giant complex, what a playground this was! Having 24 / 7 access to some of the world’s best swimming facilities, and with a seemingly endless demand for my video analysis and stroke correction services, I started to build up a big library of experience. Whilst being on the receiving end of a bit of banter from the locals for being a ‘pommie’ teaching Australians to swim, I worked with a huge range of swimmers from those just getting started in the sport to those winning triathlon and open water competitions.

These paces correspond closely to something called your Lactate Threshold (or just threshold for short). This is the point at which lactate starts to gather in your blood stream, which happens when you start to become anaerobic. If you go faster than this pace you are on borrowed time and soon feel ‘the burn’ in your muscles which will force you to slow back down again. CSS is this point in your swimming, go faster than it and you will have to slow down, but swim at CSS and you will be able to swim for 800 m, 1500 m or even 3000 m if you are very well trained. PAUL:

the others. Remember that a well-paced effort will feel quite steady at first but build in perceived intensity as it goes on: steady — tempo — hard — very hard. Carefully check that your results make sense, for instance you should have held a faster pace over 200 m than you did over 400 m, is that the case? SPORTS SCIENCE REFERENCES: The method for determining CSS by using a simple non-invasive test, without expensive equipment, was put forward by Wakayoshi [1,2]. This test was simplified in 1993 by Ginn [3] to using just two test swims of 400 m and 50 m at maximum pace to evaluate a swimmer’s aerobic capacity and identify the anaerobic and aerobic components of their fitness. It has been further refined by MacLaren and Coulson [4] who demonstrated that the best distances to choose for a CSS test set are 400 m and 200 m. These are the time trial distances that we now use within Swim Smooth. To determine what your CSS pace is in time per 100 m from your results the easiest way is to use the simple calculator at: www.swimsmooth.com/css. Or, if you would like to run the calculation yourself you can calculate your CSS pace as: CSS (m / sec) = (400 − 200) / (T400 − T200) Where T400 and T200 are your 400 m and 200 m times in seconds. Then convert your speed from m / sec into time per 100 m: CSS (sec / 100m) = 100 / CSS (m / sec) Your resultant CSS pace might at first glance appear a little easy for those of you with experience of interval training but remember that CSS is about a hard 1500 m pace. Certainly you could swim quicker than CSS in an intervals session

from different swimmers. The most common of these is where one swimmer has faster 200 m and 400 m time trial results than another but ends up with a slower CSS — which at first sight seems very strange. To understand this result we must remember that CSS pace is slower than both 200 m and 400 m pace and is much closer to 1500 m pace, take a look at Figure 27.18 to see the speed relationship for two such swimmers. Our faster swimmer is much quicker at 200 m but only slightly faster at 400 m, this drop off in pace between the two indicates the swimmer is faster at these speeds by virtue of a very strong anaerobic capacity, not because they have a higher CSS. In fact when we extrapolate the results out we see that this swimmer actually has a slower CSS and would be slower at 1500 m and beyond. FIGURE 27.18 Middle distance and distance swimmers compared. The middle distance swimmer’s 200 m and 400 m speeds are quicker but they have a slower CSS pace as the drop off between the 200 m and 400 m speeds is much steeper so this trend will continue. See our CSS calculator at www.swimsmooth.com/css. --- Page 204 Text --- The Wetronome and Finis Tempo Trainer Pro - one of these beepers will make the perfect virtual training partner for you! One problem to be aware of is if you have erroneously timed the two time trials and included a 400 m time that is a faster pace than the 200 m time — a clearly impossible result. The calculation will produce some very fast CSS figures in this situation! References 1. Wakayoshi, K., Ikuta, K., Yoshida, T., Udo, M., Moritani, T., Mutoh, Y. and Miyashita,

Powerade, Science In Sport and Powerbar. 5. Not everyone likes to consume a gel due to the texture, so experimenting with things like Powerbars, cereal bars, honey sandwiches and bananas are also a worthwhile thing to do to find out what works best for you, albeit they are generally harder to eat and digest than gels. On my Rottnest crossings (and for the English Channel) I took a large variety of things with me (some of which are comfort foods and make me feel good if I’m getting low, e.g. Fry’s Turkish Delight — yum!) just in case I fancied something different. When I swam the English Channel, despite being in the water for a little over 12 hours, I hardly strayed from my original Gatorade and GU gel plan but it was good to know that I had something different readily available if I wanted it. 6. Whilst it’s fair to say that sweat and evaporation rates are a lot different on land than in the water, you do still lose fluid in the water, so rehydrating is essential. If you are not needing to urinate every 60—90 minutes whilst training, you could be starting to become dehydrated. Equally, over-hydrating (more than 1.2 litres per hour, especially as plain water) can be extremely dangerous due to an effect known as hyponatremia, which is where you flush the body’s cells of their sodium stores. So whilst my 25-minute fuelling and hydrating strategy works for me, you should experiment between 15 and 35 minutes to see what works best. In a pool session when you are not swimming continuously it is advisable to have a water bottle for little sips in between your major fuel stops. 7.

A large marquee was erected at the event and athletes were able to mingle and look at all the latest training gear whilst asking questions of the professional triathletes and seeking useful tips. I remember being questioned by one of the local athletes who would be doing his very first triathlon at the event the following day. Like many novices he was very apprehensive about the thought of swimming in the dark and cold Llyn Padarn lake having had very little experience up to this point. As I was about to start offering a few tips of advice to the athlete, his father came over and interrupted us. He was a rather burly and forthright Welshman who had his own thoughts about how his son should approach the event. Knowing the area well, he proceeded to tell us a tale about how several plane and helicopter crashes had occurred at the site with the most recent being an RAF Wessex helicopter crash in 1993. His Dad then thought it humorous to tell us that the bodies were never recovered and to just imagine one floating up to the surface whilst we were swimming! Obviously this threw

crashes had occurred at the site with the most recent being an RAF Wessex helicopter crash in 1993. His Dad then thought it humorous to tell us that the bodies were never recovered and to just imagine one floating up to the surface whilst we were swimming! Obviously this threw the poor young guy completely but that very afternoon I went for a swim in the lake to test several wetsuits and all I could think about was this story to the point of it bringing on quite a severe panic attack. I’ve never swum so fast back to shore in my life! Anxiety attacks in the open water are very common and can affect swimmers of any ability level, the only common denominator sometimes being those who have more vivid imaginations. The possibility of anxiety attacks should be taken seriously as they cannot only ruin your race but your overall confidence in your swimming ability too. If you ever feel anxious in open water — or in the pool — here are some important coping strategies that you can use to help you overcome those feelings: 1. Remember You Are Not Alone. Many of us are embarrassed to even admit that we feel uncomfortable swimming in open water but most swimmers suffer some level of anxiety to a greater or lesser extent. Try talking openly with others about how you feel and this will help you identify what in particular triggers the feelings of panic. Half the battle when tackling anxieties is working out what it is that specifically brings on an attack — for example it could be swallowing some water and fearing you’re going to choke or perhaps losing your orientation and sense of direction. Other common triggers can be the cold itself, fear of the deep,

do you think I can swim this event in the open water?’ I was asked this exact question by an athlete that had just started swimming with us in early 2010, prior to the Busselton Half Ironman. Dan is a very dedicated athlete who seeks to improve his times in all three disciplines and often uses the latest technology to help him in this quest. Given that he’d been training consistently for the event in the pool and knowing that his CSS (threshold pace) was exactly 1:48 / 100 m, I thought that this pace would be a reasonable goal to aim for during the 1900 m swim leg. Although a Half Ironman swim is normally just below CSS pace I took into account that Dan is a leg-sinker (and still at that point very much an ‘Arnie’ Swim Type, see Chapter 18) and so would gain considerable assistance from the buoyancy of his wetsuit. I quoted a target of between 34 and 35 minutes for the swim having the exact figure of 34 minutes and 12 seconds in my head. Given that I’m often very close in my predictions, I was confident that this would be a good goal to aim for. Part of Dan’s GPS plot indicating inaccuracies in the ability to swim straight inthe open water. On race day I waited at the swim exit to see all my athletes complete the swim discipline. After 35 minutes Dan hadn’t exited the water; 37 minutes – still no sign; 40 minutes – nothing. By 42 minutes I started to get very concerned that he had suffered a bad cramp or had succumbed to some kind of marine life attack, God forbid.

sign; 40 minutes – nothing. By 42 minutes I started to get very concerned that he had suffered a bad cramp or had succumbed to some kind of marine life attack, God forbid. Ten minutes after his allocated goal time Dan came running out of the water, seemingly very happy with his swim, stating that he felt great. All I could think was how disappointed Dan would be when he saw his time – he had averaged 2:13 / 100 m or 25 seconds per 100m slower than what I thought he would. After the race I discovered that Dan had swum with a waterproof Garmin 310XT GPS device under his swim cap, which had recorded his entire swim path. On analysing the data we found that instead of covering 1.9 km, Dan had actually covered 2.33 km. More than 22% too far! This was an incredibly insightful piece of data only made possible with the advent of waterproof GPS devices like the Garmin. What was also interesting to see was that Dan had indeed averaged 1:48 / 100 m for the 2.33 km that he had covered, exactly as I thought he would. Dan would go on to use his Garmin to improve his ability to swim much straighter in future events and knock off massive chunks of time by addressing this aspect of his swim preparation. Prior to GPS tracking we could only ever guesstimate how much extra distance someone might be swimming off course but now we have the technology to find out. Whilst Dan’s example might sound quite extreme, as we see more and more GPS data at Swim Smooth we find that swimming 10% or more too far in a race is really very common.

a row you will gradually change what is initially a fuzzy picture into a clearer view of where you are going. Once you have that image in your head of where you are heading, lock onto it and focus entirely on cutting as straight a line as possible to that point. 4. Sighting on Large Immovable Objects This is a classic tip. Before the start of your open water event, walk around as much of the swim course as you can and get down as close to water level as possible to line up the marker buoys with fixed points on the horizon. A large object on the horizon could be significantly easier to see than a turn buoy whilst swimming in a group of swimmers during the race. Suitable objects might include the peak of a hill or mountain, a large building or trees. By correctly lining these points up before the start and then aiming towards them when the gun goes off, you stand a much better chance of swimming in a straight line between the turn buoys. At many locations it might only be possible to line up the first marker buoy from the start line. If that is the case, then work out as many sighting points as you can for other sections of the course. If your swim will be in a river or --- Page 259 Text --- following the line of a shore, make sure that you gauge the distance well in order to swim parallel and straight.

to swim parallel and straight. Keep a check on this every time you breathe to your side. 5. Don’t be a Sheep When drafting behind another swimmer it is very easy to fall into a false sense of security and think that the lead swimmer will track accurately towards the next buoy. Even the best swimmers in the world can drift off course sometimes, so maintain your own responsibility for swimming straight by regularly sighting and adjusting your position if necessary. If your lead swimmer does drift off course you will have to weigh up the benefit of the draft versus swimming in a straight line. This is not always an easy decision and you may have to risk the success of your swim on this choice. ADAM: It’s well worth investing in a couple of pairs of goggles (preferably of the same design that you know fit you well) with different lens tints for the different lighting conditions that you may experience. Cool mirrored lenses will be too dark in low-light conditions no matter how good you look wearing them! Equally, a clear lens in low early morning sunlight can be dazzling. Choose goggles which do not leak, have good anti-fog properties and won’t dislodge easily if you happen to get a knock from another swimmer. Avoid touching the inside of the lens with your greasy fingers (especially if you’ve used them to apply sunscreen or wetsuit lubricant) as this will ruin the anti-fog properties very quickly. You won’t notice your goggles if they are working well but a goggle malfunction could cost you your race. --- Page 260 Text --- CHAPTER 36 Drafting Effectively Swimming behind or to the side of another swimmer to gain an advantage from being in their wake is called ‘drafting’. As we will

for a distinct competitive advantage! Technical Aside If you are interested in the research behind drafting here’s an overview of the key studies: ADAM: The technical term ‘metabolic cost’ refers to the energy used by the swimmers. You can equate it to your physical effort: a reduction of 20% metabolic cost is a 20% reduction in your workload. A collaborative study in 2003 between Jean-Claude Chatard of the University of Saint-Etienne in France and Barry Wilson at the University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand [1], aimed to show just how much benefit there is to be gained from swimming behind, or to the side of, another swimmer in a fixed flume tank environment. The study examined which were the most effective positions (to the side or behind) and also the optimal distance to be from the lead swimmer. The study concluded that sitting approximately 50cm behind the lead swimmer reduced the draftee’s metabolic response between 11% and 38%. The large range in the result possibly indicates just how skilful this practice is, with those more technically proficient at drafting being able to reap the biggest rewards. Several other studies have also shown similar savings. Delextrat et al. in 2003 [2] found a 10-24% reduction in the metabolic cost of swimming when drafting was compared with swimming solo. In a 1998 study of elite triathletes, Chatard, Chollet and Millet [3] found up to a 3.2% improvement in direct speed (around 40 seconds per 1500 m). Interestingly, this latter study indicated that those of very lean muscle mass saw the --- Page 263 Text --- biggest gains from drafting, potentially because the elevated speed assisted in their horizontal body position in the water – Arnies take note! How to Draft There are two distinct positions in which you can draft: 1.

triathletes so it is little wonder they experience the biggest improvements of all swimmers from wearing a buoyant wetsuit. ADAM: We conduct a lot of wetsuit testing with different styles of suits and different types of swimmers in Perth. In a well fitting suit, we often see time savings of up to five minutes over 1500 m in swimmers who have very ‘sinky’ legs. Amazing! As we shall see though, some other swimmers don’t enjoy swimming in their wetsuits at all. --- Page 270 Text --- PAUL: I have been working with double Ironman winner Kate Bevilaqua for the last 12 months over in Perth. Kate is a fantastic athlete but is someone who finds swimming in a wetsuit very awkward indeed. It is true to say that most swimmers are substantially faster in a wetsuit than without, however Kate finds the exact opposite: she feels it is slowing her down. Many triathletes are held back by a very poor body position but conversely some have very good natural buoyancy and find that the addition of a neoprene suit actually lifts them too high out of the water. This is the problem that Kate was experiencing. Kate was giving away the best part of ten minutes to the other professional women in the Ironman swim when using a wetsuit. At this level of competition this is a massive amount of time and a real Achilles heel in her racing. Between Ironman Western Australia (December 2010) and Ironman Lanzarote (May 2011) we lowered Kate’s swim time from 61 minutes to 53 minutes. How did we do this? Technically Kate swims very well in the open water without a wetsuit but as soon as she put on her suit she felt like she was going backwards. We took a close look at

lift your backside and legs higher. When swimming in a flowing river and where access will permit, aim to swim close to the bank when you are swimming against the current and in the middle of the river when the flow is pushing you along. The greatest flow is normally in the middle of a river with a reduced flow nearer the banks; make the most of this effect by adjusting your position depending on your direction of swimming and you can save a lot of time on your swim. 2. Lakes The threat from marine wildlife in lakes is very low but they can be quite eerie to swim in if they have dark and murky water. In most locations around the world lakes are quite cold too. Both of these factors can exacerbate feelings of anxiety or panic when swimming. Getting into cold water is often more of a mental than a physical challenge. When entering a lake do so slowly and pause when thigh deep to splash some cold water over your face two or three times. The receptors that set off the gasp-panic response to cold water are all centred around your eyes and cheek bones and splashing water here will allow your body to adjust before you start swimming. Also try splashing water on your chest and back if you are not wearing a wetsuit or pull out the neck of your wetsuit to allow some water to run down your chest. This might feel --- Page 277 Text --- uncomfortable but you will be calmer and less likely to panic when you first start swimming. The hardest part about any cold open water swim is just getting started – after preparing properly, turn your brain off and get on with it. A quiet brain’s

everyone else is going to struggle in these conditions but that you can lift your stroke rate and punch through the waves and chop then you are going to really excel in your races. Most of all, learn to love the experience: it’s akin to the challenges of a hilly cycle ride or technical MTB trail versus a ‘boring’ flat time trial! --- Page 279 Text --- PAUL: A question we often get asked is ‘Where should I position myself at the start of a race?’ Many new swimmers have been told to hang back and stay out wide to avoid the hustle and bustle of the start. Whilst we would never encourage anyone with limited experience to head right to the centre of the mêlée, it’s often a mistake to go too far back and wide as well. The last thing you want to do is add a large amount of extra distance by taking a long path to the first buoy or get caught behind many slower swimmers by starting right at the back. Even if it’s your first ever open water event, you should have spent enough time practicing the skills outlined earlier in Open Water Adaptation (Key 3) to become familiar with swimming at close quarters with other swimmers. Far too often we hear from swimmers whose very first experience of swimming in open water was during a race. This is a recipe for disaster as you seriously risk a panic attack and being put off this great sport for life. If you have worked on your specific open water skills both in the pool and in open water training, there’s no reason why you cannot start amongst other swimmers of your speed and take the shortest line to the first buoy.

gulp of air and then hold their breath for as long as they can while swimming. This approach typically leads to a bad experience, such as hyperventilating or even concluding that swimming is just too hard and giving up altogether. Each of these defining characteristics of swimming is discussed in greater detail in the following chapters, which constitute a progression of steps to lead you to success! Swimming venueS: PoolS Swimming pools come in many sizes and shapes, and various configurations can provide a great place to learn and train. Only certified pools are used in recognized competitions, and they come in a variety of strictly measured distances. In the United States, many age-group and college competitions take place in what are called short- course yard (SCY) pools, which measure 25 yards (~23 m) in length. The United States is the only country still competing in this type of pool, and other countries typ- ically use short-course meter (SCM) pools, which measure 25 meters (~27 yd) (figure 1). Because meters are about 10 percent longer than yards, record times for meters swims are longer than those done for yard swims. Note that in this book, yards are used for pool dimensions. If you swim in a pool measured in meters, you can use the same number given in the descriptions. For example, if an instruction is to swim 25 yards, that can also be 25 meters. Another type of competitive swimming venue is a long-course meter (LCM) pool, which is often referred to as an Olympic-size pool. LCM pools are 50 meters (~55 yd) long, and though they may not look particularly long on Olympic television broadcasts, the experience of swimming in them can be much different than that of swimming in a short-course pool. All of these competition pools

below the bony part where the eyebrows are located, in the softer part of each socket. Without using the strap, press the goggles gently onto this soft tissue and see if they stay even for just a few seconds; if they do, you have a good fit! The strap merely needs to hold the goggles in place, and of course it should not be made so tight as to injure your eyes. The strap should fit above your ears and wrap near the top of the back of your head (not at the base of your skull down near your neck). Beyond these basics, goggle preference is an individual matter, much like the choice of putter for a golfer. Considerations include one’s face shape and head size, as well as one’s preference for a foam, silicone, or rubber gasket (or no gasket at all). The gasket is simply the part of the goggle that contacts the face around the eye or the barrier between plastic and your face. Choosing among these options is largely a matter of what works best for you. Most sporting goods stores and swimming pro shops carry a variety of goggles, and you can simply ask an associate for a demo model or for permission to open a package in order to check the fit. Caps A swimmer with long hair often wears a cap for two reasons. First, of course, it keeps the hair out of the way and reduces drag; second, it provides a measure of protection from xiv --- Page 16 Text --- The Sport of Swimming the sometimes-harsh chemicals or other environmental factors in the water. These environmental factors can include the sun when outside, bacteria in the water, and other chemicals in the water—such as a residual-like suntan lotion that came

or backstroke, thus isolating and training the pulling motion of the swimming arm stroke. Figure 5 Pull bouys. Size and shape will vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Snorkel The swimmer’s snorkel is a fairly recent development (figure 6). Of course, traditional side-mounted snorkels have been around for years, but the newer center-mounted snorkel is designed specifically for swim training. It allows swimmers to focus fully on their strokes without the added concern of when and where to breathe. xvii --- Page 19 Text --- The Sport of Swimming Figure 6 Swimmers’ snorkels are typically center mounted rather than offset like they are for scuba diving, and they have a strap that goes around the head. geTTing STArTed: drillS And Their PurPoSe Because body movements are controlled by the brain, the activity of swimming—an unnatural activity for humans that requires complex, timed movements—requires us to program the brain in order to direct the body effectively in the water. This process is sometimes referred to as developing “muscle memory,” but it actually involves brain imprinting and patterning. With this in mind, several drills are described for each step in this book in order to imprint the relevant movement patterns on your brain so that you can easily replicate them over and over again. One caveat: Some of the drills imprint an overcorrection that will later be refined. As mentioned earlier, swimmers often use training equipment to help them acquire new skills or imprint new movement patterns. One must also take care, how- ever, not to become dependent on that equipment for being able to move through the water with skill and ease. In addition, your success depends on doing the drills and using the equipment correctly rather than quickly. As with any learning, some swim- mers progress faster than others, and each

the end of this step, you should be able to • transition from vertical to floating on your back, • transition from vertical to floating on your front, • balance on your center of buoyancy in a streamlined position on your back, and • balance on your center of buoyancy in a streamlined position on your front. The Physics oF Buoyancy and FloaTing Floating is a skill, which means that anyone can do it if he or she learns how. As humans, we float naturally, at least to some degree, because our lungs are filled with air. In fact, our center of buoyancy is located approximately in the center of the chest, at the sternum. Some other sports also require attention to one’s center of gravity, but the priority in swimming, of course, is to find that center while moving through the water. You can imagine this center as the center of a teeter-totter or seesaw on a chil- dren’s playground. When everything is in balance, the teeter-totter does not move. Lift either end, however, and the opposite end goes down. With this analogy in mind, you can start learning how to float on your back. FloaTing on your Back This section takes you from standing in a vertical position to simply floating on your back. You need access to a pool with water deep enough to reach at least to your waist but shallow enough that you can still stand in it. If needed, the action can also be done from the side of a deep pool with a few modifications. Back Floating With Arms Extended The objective here is to lie back on the water with your arms and legs spread out for balance, almost like a starfish, and float without movement (figure 1.1).

Streamline Drill 3 Torpedo This drill complements the pencil-to-brick drill. Here, you sink under the water, assume the streamlined position, push off forcefully, and, without making any other movements, see how far you go before stopping. This drill gives you an idea of the importance of reducing drag force. Remember, in the streamlined position, your hands are stacked and your arms are squeezing your ears (or head under and squeezing your elbows together); your legs are long and your toes pointed.

More specifically, you have learned and practiced drills that create a solid foundation for swimming and for applying force to the water in order to move through it efficiently. You have also learned about the importance of using the streamlined position to reduce drag. In addition, the drills and skills included in this step have led you to be more comfortable in the water, especially in positions that are not natural in most of your nonaquatic life. Being relaxed and comfortable is a key factor in the remaining steps to swimming success. You are well on your way to success in swimming if you have mastered the following skills: 1. Transitioning from a vertical position to floating on your back 2. Transitioning from a vertical position to floating on your front 3. Balancing on your center of buoyancy in a streamlined position on your back 4. Balancing on your center of buoyancy in a streamlined position on your front score your success If you scored more than 30 points, then you have completed this step.

to apply pressure than air does. Swimmers can take advantage of this density by using 21 --- Page 41 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success propulsive force to their advantage. Specifically, they apply pressure to the water in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction in which they want to go. Think of it this way: When you exit the pool, you place your hands on the pool deck in a horizontal position—that is, perpendicular to the direction (up) in which you want to go. As you apply pressure downward, your body rises above the position where it started. Now, mentally rotate these dynamics from the vertical to the horizontal and envision pressing against water instead of against the pool deck, and you have the basic concept of using propulsive force for swimming. For another analogy, consider rockets, which are powered by massive propulsive force and resisted by relatively little drag force because they are long and skinny. Similarly, as discussed in step 1 of this book, a swimmer is well advised to assume a long, thin shape with good balance. Here in step 2, it is time to apply propulsive force. Now that you have reduced drag force by becoming streamlined, you can move on to using propulsive force by putting pressure on the water in an appropriate way. MiniMizing Drag Learning to minimize your “drag profile” takes repetition and some minor adjust- ments. As in step 1, in which you achieved balance in a streamlined position, you now start by ensuring that you are as long and narrow (i.e., as rocketlike) as possible. In order to feel the effects of drag and minimize their influence, repeat the push-off drill but add some new elements, starting with the manner in which you push off. The following few instructions

with fingers pitching down toward the bottom of the pool. 4. Keeping the elbows and arms long but not locked, repeat b the process until you can feel forward movement. MissTeP You keep your hands very stiff. correcTion Relax your hands and feel the water. MissTeP You don’t go anywhere when sculling. correcTion Make sure that your hands are slightly cupped, which provides the same high-pressure and low-pressure propulsion as propellers and airplane wings. Water will flow faster over the top part of the hand as it has a greater distance to travel, and the inside arc of the hand has a smaller linear distance, so the water remains easier to hold. The faster moving water on the top of the hand is low pressure, and the palm would be higher pressure. To achieve equilibrium, the barrier (i.e., the hand) will move toward the lower pressure. 28 --- Page 48 Text --- Manipulating the Water Drill For sculling Use the following drill to help practice the sculling skill. Sculling Drill sculling With a Pull Buoy Next, put this skill to work in a swimming position. Place a pull buoy between your legs slightly above your knees. Lie flat and facedown on the water in a neutral posi- tion, as described in step 1, with your arms extended above your head. Keep your hands relaxed, with your fingers pitched slightly downward, and slowly try the scull- ing motion until you feel yourself being pulled forward. This is a complex skill that takes time to master. It requires movements that are not fast, rigid, or mechanical but slow, controlled, and fluid. Use slow, rhythmic move- ments and make sure that your hands never stop; they should be sweeping either out or in at any given time. Failure to master this skill does

Repeat the process several times before moving on; each time, try to enter through the “hole” that your hands make in the water. Figure 8.1 KneelIng DIve Set 1.

Track Start Drill 1 15-Meter Though not really a drill, this exercise enables you to determine which start is best for you. Try the grab start and record your time at 15 yards. Do the same for the track start with each leg serving as the forward leg. Do this sequence several times to determine which type of start is best for you. In competition pools, the 15-yard mark is signified by an off-color (e.g., red or yellow) disk as part of the lane line. If the pool does not have such a mark, you can use any measured distance beyond 10 yards. Track Start Drill 2 Standing Jump This drill isolates the push portion of the start.

traces its history back to ancient times, when pool swimming did not exist but of course both large and small bodies of water did. Whether for sport or survival, then, this is where the bloodline of all swimming begins. Although open-water swimming and pool swimming share similar stroke skills, they are completely different sports in many ways. For one thing, pool swimming takes place in a very controlled environment with a set distance and controlled water and air temperatures. In contrast, open-water and survival swimming take place in settings affected by variable environmental factors. This step focuses on skills and drills that are important for both competitive and recreational open-water swim- ming, as well as those that can help you in an emergency. Before you start, review the following safety principles, which applies to all types of open-water swimming, whether for competition, recreation, or survival. 1. Never swim alone. 2. Be aware of environmental factors. 3. Plan your swim and make your plan known to others. 4. Take all appropriate safety equipment and make sure that it is in good work- ing order. 183 --- Page 203 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Open-Water SWimming: the envirOnment The first consideration for any open-water swim is the environment, which includes air and water temperatures, weather, surface conditions, currents, geography (of both the shore and the water beneath the surface), water quality, and any wildlife in the area. (See figure 9.1 for a basic open-water course.) Air temperature plays a role not only in the potential for hypothermia when you get out of the water but also in how quickly a body of water cools. In addition, large differences between air tem- perature and water temperature stress the body because the body requires energy to regulate temperature. Of course, water temperature itself

only in the potential for hypothermia when you get out of the water but also in how quickly a body of water cools. In addition, large differences between air tem- perature and water temperature stress the body because the body requires energy to regulate temperature. Of course, water temperature itself is also of great concern. Water starts feeling cold to most people around 81 degrees Fahrenheit (27 degrees Celsius) and too warm at about 85 degrees Fahrenheit (29 degrees Celsius). In international competitions, water temperatures are required to be between about 61 and 88 degrees Fahrenheit (16 and 31 degrees Celsius). Competitions with cooler temperatures often allow com- petitors to use wetsuits for warmth rather than requiring traditional bathing suits. Turn buoy Finish Start 750 meter course 1.5K course Figure 9.1 Basic open-water course. E6544/Bay/fig 9.04/534233/kh/R2-alw Another environmental concern for open-water swimming is the weather. A good swim depends in part on good planning in relation to sunrise and sunset times, as well as the weather forecast for the area. Swimming in the dark is never recom- mended because of increased animal activity, less visibility, and colder tempera- tures. Open-water swimmers should also avoid inclement weather, including rain and especially thunderstorms. Fog is also a concern because it impedes navigation and can create an emergency for an otherwise accomplished swimmer. 184 --- Page 204 Text --- Open-Water and Survival Swimming Open-water swimmers must also consider surface conditions when planning a swim. This is especially true of larger bodies of water, in which waves and swells can be problematic; however, it is also true for smaller bodies of water, in which even a light chop of small waves can create an issue. Swells and chop are often caused by wind, but they can also be produced by other factors, such as

Make sure to bring your upper leg forward. 204 --- Page 224 Text --- Open-Water and Survival Swimming Sidestroke Arm Sweep Armstroking in the sidestroke (figure 9.8) involves a chain of movements. The extended arm sweeps down, with the elbow bent, to about the mid body; whereas the arm closest to the surface sneaks up along the body. The hands meet, and the arm closest to the surface then pushes back down toward the thigh while the other arm sneaks forward. Many swimmers benefit from using the mental image of reaching to pick an apple, then transferring it to the other hand to put it in a bag at the hip. Figure 9.8 SideStrOke arm SWeep Preparation 1.

If you have found greater confidence in the water as you have progressed through the steps in this book, it is time to explore options for continuing your swimming, whether for recreation or for competition. The first part of the process involves finding a place to swim regularly. Many parks and recreation departments maintain swimming pools that are open to the public on at least a seasonal basis. Other places to search include the YMCA, YWCA, Jewish Community Centers, fitness clubs, swim clubs, schools, and health and well- ness centers. Key considerations include schedule, quality of facilities, staff, and, of course, cost. The next part of the process involves practicing the skills that you have already mastered and building on them. The sport of swimming depends on skill-based movement, and it is often helpful to go all the way back to the beginning to review what you have done and see where you can make improvements. Now that you have been through the process once—and gained a new level of confidence in the water— it would be a good idea to go back through the steps and make sure that you get them right at the highest level of which you are capable. Goal SettinG Goal setting is an important part of any healthy lifestyle, whether it is done for fit- ness, recreation, or competition. Regardless of what area of life you are addressing, goal setting gives you direction and focus. It helps shape your decision making, not

system based on the acronym SMART. The S in SMART stands for specific, which means that the goal should include meaningful detail about activity, time, location, and requirements. A vague goal might read like this: “I am going to start swimming more.” In contrast, a more spe- cific goal might read like this: “I am going to swim three or more times per week.” This kind of specificity is useful in fitness, recreational, and competitive swimming. The M in SMART stands for measurable. Setting measurable goals helps you hold yourself accountable and motivates you when you reach milestones by giving you a sense of accomplishment. The key here is to determine what you are trying to meas- ure. For example, a fitness swimmer might track number of swims, a recreational swimmer might track distance covered, and a competitive swimmer might track times. The A stands for achievable. It may be inspirational to think that you can do any- thing you set your mind to, but it is often more effective to set short-term goals that are attainable on your way to achieving a long-term ambition. Achievable goals serve as milestones on your path to a bigger goal. The best part is that the more often you achieve meaningful goals, the better you get at developing the skills, personal attrib- utes, mind-set, and habits that lead you to bigger goals. The R stands for realistic. When setting goals, you should always be honest with yourself. For example, if you have just started swimming and have mastered all of the strokes presented in this book, then you might set a realistic goal of swimming a mile (1.6 km) without stopping within the next year. An example of an unrealistic goal would be trying to make the U.S. national swim team in the

An example of an unrealistic goal would be trying to make the U.S. national swim team in the next six months. Granted, this is a dramatic example, but it can in fact be a tricky thing to set a realistic 216 --- Page 236 Text --- Continuing With Swimming goal. Make it too easy and there is no challenge; a result, meeting your goals may ring hollow. Make it too challenging and you may get frustrated with the process and move on to something else. Finally, the T stands for time—that is, identifying a specific time period in which you want to accomplish your goal. This is the part of your goal that gets you out of bed on a cold morning or motivates you to squeeze in a swim over lunch. You are typ- ically happy later on for doing so, but many of us can rationalize many reasons to skip what we know is good for us in exchange for an extra 10 minutes of sleep or a slice of pizza or scoop of ice cream. Mind you, these things are not necessarily bad in their proper place, but a time-limited goal keeps your focus on what you want to achieve and when you want to get it done. Simply saying “I want to lose weight” has no real meaning in terms of time, but saying “I want to lose five pounds by January 1” puts the goal on the clock and is much more likely to change your behavior. Following Up on Goals Once you achieve a goal, what comes next? In competitive swimming, the

has no real meaning in terms of time, but saying “I want to lose five pounds by January 1” puts the goal on the clock and is much more likely to change your behavior. Following Up on Goals Once you achieve a goal, what comes next? In competitive swimming, the answer is easy because the next goal can always be set by the clock. In contrast, fitness and recreational swimmers might focus on doing more frequent swims or even having a go at competitive swimming. Regardless of how you frame the issue, have your next goal ready when you achieve your current one. In addition, make time to celebrate your achievements. Reward and recognition are very motivating, especially when the rewards are intrinsic. FindinG a ProGram Various programs are available, and the right choice depends on your goals. For exam- ple, if you are a fitness or recreational swimmer, you may not need a lot of structure; in fact, you may find great satisfaction in accomplishing everything on your own. Due to the technical nature of the sport, however, most people need a support group or pro- gram to help them along. Many large metropolitan areas are home to a diverse group of swimming programs; smaller areas may have fewer options. In either case, certain questions can help you decide whether to join a program or continue on your own. Two big considerations are program schedule and program structure. If the pro- gram’s schedule does not fit yours, this need not necessarily be end of the conversa- tion with that facility. Ask if the staff would consider offering a program at a time that works better for you. Many swimmers just accept a schedule as it is posted and move on if it doesn’t work for them, but sometimes a

not necessarily be end of the conversa- tion with that facility. Ask if the staff would consider offering a program at a time that works better for you. Many swimmers just accept a schedule as it is posted and move on if it doesn’t work for them, but sometimes a facility manager is simply unaware of the demand for a different time slot. If a number of swimmers show up at the pool at the same time you prefer, go ahead and ask the management about starting a new offering or expanding an existing one. The structure of the program is also a consideration. Some programs just have a workout leader who swims the workout and provides minimal feedback. Others are more instructive, providing a teacher in the water or on the deck who can give individual feedback and really help participants improve. Still other programs have a full-time professional coach on the deck who helps swimmers both with workout considerations and with stroke improvement. The most instructive setup, of course, is the lesson environment. A careful review of your experience with this book can help you identify what type of program is best suited to your needs and goals. 217 --- Page 237 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success ChooSinG a CoaCh or inStruCtor This process involves a number of factors, all of which focus on you; indeed, swim- ming programs exist not because of coaches or instructors but because of swimmers.

coaches and instructors, and there are poor ones. In addition, what works for one swimmer may not work for another. As much as possible, your choice should be dictated by your goals and your level of proficiency. For any swimmer, the introduction to a program, coach, or instructor should always start with a conversation. If yours is a new face on the pool deck, then you can expect someone from the program to greet you. Hopefully, that person does a short interview and asks about your swimming background. The best bet is to be honest so that the coach or instructor gets a good idea of what you want and need. It is also a good idea to ask him or her plenty of questions. Here are a few exam- ples: What is your coaching philosophy? How do you integrate new people into the group? And what is the fee for the program? As for program content, some coaches and instructors take a workout-oriented approach, whereas others focus more on instruction. Neither approach is necessarily better than the other; again, it depends on your goals. The nature of a good coach or instructor may vary from one person’s opinion to another, but certain characteristics are shared by all great coaches in any sport. First, they care—not only about the sport and its highest-level athletes but also about help- ing every athlete they encounter, regardless of level or goals, to love the sport and continually seek improvement. They put effort into each athlete and each session while also working to make themselves better. This is what coaching grit is all about. If one method doesn’t work, they try another—and another and another—until they are successful with each athlete. Nor are they afraid to ask for help from a colleague; in fact,

If one method doesn’t work, they try another—and another and another—until they are successful with each athlete. Nor are they afraid to ask for help from a colleague; in fact, the best coaches do this all the time. They are committed to helping athletes achieve their goals, which is why they are themselves successful. Where do you find these programs and people? Read on. SWimminG reSourCeS The next part of your journey into the wider world of swimming is to look for resources to help you become a better swimmer. Of course, several resources are available from Human Kinetics that are part of the aquatics department. There are also multimedia resources, such as videos and other instructional media. A word of caution: Most anyone can “publish” most anything on the web, which means that you need to exer- cise a critical eye in selecting swimming materials. The most reputable sources for additional instruction are the national governing bodies that work with aquatics, from the very young to the most senior members of the aquatics community. Through these organizations, you can find numerous resources, including in-person coaching. USA Swimming (www.usaswimming.org) is the governing body that regulates U.S. swimming for age groups from eight and under all the way through elite inter- national competition, including the Olympics. USA Swimming is governed primarily by volunteers, and contact can be made through Local Swimming Committees (LSCs) since the organization is structured geographically. Simply access the USA Swimming website, which will put you in touch with local resources to help you along on your swimming journey if you are looking for a very high level of competition or access to coaches at this level. 218

Adults seeking resources (e.g., workout plans and additional instruction) can look here to find programs for aquatics at every level in their local area. Like USA Swimming, this organization depends on volunteers and operates in the same manner—in this case, through Local Masters Swimming Committees (LMSCs). Another national governing body that deals with adult aquatics and fitness on a variety of levels in USA Triathlon (www.usatriathlon.org). This organization addresses all ages and, since one of the disciplines of triathlon is swimming, it can provide you with a number of opportunities to continue your swimming if you choose multisport racing for fitness or competition. In addition to national governing bodies, there are a number of professional swim teaching and coaching organizations that you can contact for additional resources. All you need to do is search for them using keywords such as “swim instruction” or “swim lessons.” Many can be found at the same facilities that you are looking at to secure lane space, so you have a convenient way to continue your journey. Swimming is a great sport for health, wellness, and competition; it is also a life skill in that it can mean surviving an emergency situation.
