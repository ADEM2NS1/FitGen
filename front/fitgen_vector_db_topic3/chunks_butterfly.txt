assist in rotation and sideways stabilization of the body. In freestyle and backstroke, the obliques act in partnership, one as a mover and one as a stabilizer, to produce the pendulum- like roll that provides leverage to the arm stroke. As the swimmer rolls into the stroke, the oblique muscle on the opposite side acts as the primary moving muscle, while the oblique on the same side works to stabilize the core and hips. As the leading arm changes, so does the function of the obliques. THE DELTOIDS The deltoids are the bilateral muscles that cover the shoulders. The function of the deltoids is to lift and assist with rotation of the arm. In butterfly, freestyle and backstroke, where the arm recovers out of the water, the deltoids act as primary movers to lift and return the arm to the beginning of the stroke. However, during the power phase of the stroke, the deltoids serve as stabilizers to the shoulder as the arm sweeps through the three-dimensional path of the underwater stroke. 36 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 36 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 39 Text --- The Swimming Muscles THE QUADRICEPS The quadriceps are the large and powerful four-part muscles located in the front of the thigh. The function of the quads is to straighten the leg from the hip to the knee and to provide stability to the lower body and knee. In flutter and dolphin kick, the quads are the primary movers as they drive the legs downward for the powerful downbeat of the kick. However, during the upbeat, they serve as knee stabilizers, keeping it from hyper-extending. Strength training should address both moving and stabilizing. Because the stabilizing effect is more subtle, often strength-building efforts focus on the moving function and ignore the stabilizing function. The importance of self-

The relatively smaller muscles of the limbs may ultimately apply the resistance, but the larger muscles of the core are able to produce more force and power, allowing a faster tempo to be created and sustained. The muscles of the core, both in the front and the back of the body, are also our primary stabilizers. As the connectors between the upper and lower limbs, the tension held in these muscles is central to producing efficient and coordinated stroke action. Without core tension, we would not be able to achieve a unified stroke, produce leverage, or maintain balance and alignment throughout the changing positions of the stroke. 38 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 38 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 41 Text --- The Swimming Muscles TAKE A SWIMMING LESSON FROM A SEAL Part of the Pinniped order (from the Latin meaning “wing foot”), we have to look in awe at seals, who are not only among the fastest aquatic mammals but are also the most efficient swimmers. Moving through the water at speeds up to 25 miles per hour (about the same speed as dolphins and whales), seals are at the top of the list in terms of least energy cost associated with producing speed. It seems that seals have perfected swimming. Like humans, seals are air-breathing mammals, and like us, they have four limbs. However, over millions of years, these descendents of bears have adapted to using aquatic locomotion so well that we should stop and pay attention. Watching the seal swimming at high speed, we see that it holds its front limbs flat against the sides of its body and uses a narrow, undulating motion that starts at the head and moves down through its body. This wave action is based on movement and stabilization of the seal’s spine by the

common swimming-related health problems. If a swimmer’s shoulder does become painful, rest, as well as targeted strengthening exercises of the shoulder stabilizers, should be part of the recovery process. 44 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 44 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 47 Text --- The Swimming Muscles KEY MUSCLES FOR CERTAIN STROKES We want to think in terms of multi-muscle swimming movements as much as possible, however because the pull pattern, kicking action, leverage and balance requirements in each of the four competitive swimming strokes is unique, we must consider which muscles are especially important to each stroke. BUTTERFLY The wide bilateral recovery of the butterfly places a demand on the trapezius unlike any other stroke. In addition, the initial movements of the power phase are done when the swimmer’s body is lower than the chest, requiring the pectoralis major to engage in a distinct lifting action. Finally, as the dolphin kick places the hips in a higher position relative to the body than in other strokes, the gluteus maximus comes into play. Key Butterfly Muscles 45 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 45 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 48 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming BACKSTROKE To achieve the ideal body position in backstroke, the pelvis must be tilted Key Backstroke Muscles forward through abdominal contraction of the retus abdominus. The upward kick, against gravity also puts a large demand on the quads. The unique catch position, behind the head requires the rhomboids to contract heavily. Finally, the elongated push portion of the arm stroke engages the triceps more completely, and for a longer duration than in other strokes. BREASTSTROKE The unique requirements of the breaststroke kick engage several muscles that are not otherwise used much in swimming. While the hamstrings are used to raise the heels, the hip flexors and abductors perform and stabilize

drills led by his coach three times a week. Peter’s work ethic was so admirable that he was given a trophy at the team’s annual awards banquet. Peter attended swim meets regularly, holding clearly in his mind the goal of swimming faster than ever before. One day, after placing fifth in his favorite event, the 50 butterfly, he looked at the field of swimmers at the finish and spotted his teammate Allen raising his fist in victory. “Good for him!” Peter thought momentarily as a sense of confusion welled up inside of him and set in. Allen wasn’t a hard worker. He fooled around a lot and snuck out of practice early all the time. How could he have won the race? Peter’s coach approached both his swimmers with enthusiastic congratulations. As they stood side by side, Peter was struck by the fact that his teammate was nearly a head taller than he was. He had never noticed how much Allen had grown or how husky his voice had become. At the end of the meet, he confided in his coach, asking why he wasn’t improving like Allen was. His wise coach pointed out that Peter was progressing and, in fact, had done his best time. He said it was important to be patient and keep up his good training. “Your day will come, Peter,” the coach told him. Peter held on to his coach’s words. Over the next year and a half, Peter trained regularly, both in and out of the water, developing a well-defined six pack that he was proud of. Eventually, Allen decided to trade in his jammers for a soccer ball. Peter kept whittling away slowly and patiently at his times in competition and, after advancing to the 13-14 division, he adopted the 100 fly as

swimming. The motion is repeated with a controlled reverse action or recovery between each exertion. The swimmer can use a tempo equal to his or her swimming tempo against resistance or practice an “ideal” higher tempo. Stretch cords also promote core stabilization, as the swimmer must maintain constant tension in the body from the standing position, bent forward at the waist, while the arms are moving. Stretch cords are available in a variety of thicknesses, which determine their resistance. Because too much resistance will make proper technique impossible, it is important to start with a stretch band that has less resistance and work up to more resistance when good technique is maintained. The following stretch cord exercises are highly recommended: 82 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 82 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 85 Text --- Let’s Get Specific FULL BODY Double Arm Pull — Standing and bent forward at the waist, hold the stretch cord in both hands and perform the underwater path of butterfly, accelerating throughout.

Focus on making sure you have good body roll, and breathe on your pulling-arm side. Breathe as infrequently as possible, but don’t let the drill become an aerobic challenge: you need to be swimming within yourself, rather than gasping for air. You can swim a whole length using just one arm, or take a certain number of breaths before changing sides. I prefer to change sides every four to six strokes, as it feels more balanced, but experiment to find the pattern that works best for you. --- Page 131 Text --- This is a tough drill, and under stress this swimmer has lifted his head, compromising his streamlined position in the water. He is, though, showing a very nice high-elbow pull. Trailing-arm variation This harder variation of the one-arm drill works your technique in a different way. In this version you leave your non-pulling arm trailing at your side, rather than reaching out in front of you, and breathe on the non-pulling side. The focus is on what your pulling-arm side is doing as you roll away from it to take a breath, and on timing the breath.

The drill loosens up your torso, gives a really strong feeling for swimming on your side, and a feel for the rotation of your hips and kicking action as you breathe. 1. Push off the wall and take an arm stroke. Keep your other arm extended, and breathe on this first stroke, as you would coming to the surface after a turn. 2. After the recovery, stay rolled to the side and take a second arm stroke with the same arm. Use the forward movement of your arm as it enters the water and the turn of your head after the breath to create a butterfly motion of your body. Let this motion wave down your body, ending in a kick. 3. After two arm strokes on one side, repeat the pattern on the other side, pulling with the other arm, rolling your body in that direction and breathing on a new side. --- Page 133 Text --- SWIMMING BLIND You do need an empty lane to try this! But it’s a really good way to judge how straight and balanced your stroke is. Most of us are constantly making teeny little body adjustments to keep swimming in a straight line. These are based on visual inputs that you don’t consciously register. Take them away, and a truer idea of how balanced your technique is will emerge. I also find swimming blind is a useful way of concentrating on how your stroke feels. It’s amazing how much easier it is to sense the effectiveness of your arm pull, or the degree of water resistance you’re experiencing, with your eyes shut. Start by swimming along above

knee. Note how this affects the angle at which your legs come over during the tumble. For example, reaching outside your left knee with your right hand will mean your legs tumble over to the right-hand side, rather than directly over the centre line of your body. --- Page 143 Text --- Timing The only way to learn the timing of your tumble turn – when to start the tumble in order to plant your feet solidly on the wall – is through trial and error. The variables include your degree of flexibility, the speed at which you tumble, and the pace at which you approach the wall. 1. Swim toward the wall at the end of your lane. For the last few strokes, it’s OK to look ahead more than you usually would. When you feel you’re one or two strokes from the end of the lane, allow yourself to glide forward with one arm extended. Start your tumble once your hand’s about 50 cm from the wall. 2. You’re aiming to tumble over very slightly short of the wall, as your momentum will carry you a small way. Aim to land with your legs bent and your feet squarely on the wall. Your body should be sideways, rather than fully upside-down: apply the knowledge you got from the previous drill to achieve this. 3. For now, just keep practising, adjusting the point at which you tumble until --- Page 144 Text --- you always land with your feet solidly planted on the wall. --- Page 145 Text --- Underwater kick, dolphin --- Page 146 Text --- Underwater kick, freestyle DRIVE FROM THE WALL The final element of a good tumble turn is your drive away from the wall.

Doing this well can gain you a lot of ground. It also sets you up to start swimming from a moving, rather than a standing, start. Four key elements have to be combined to get good drive. 1 Pushing off strongly This depends on having your feet planted firmly on the wall in a position that means they won’t slip. If you find this is a problem, go back to the timing drill and practise more. Never push off down, toward the bottom of the pool; push off parallel to the surface, at the same depth as you ended up after the tumble. --- Page 147 Text --- 2 Rotation back to a face-down position After pushing off, you need to rotate your body so that instead of being on your side, you’re facing the bottom of the pool. As this is achieved, step 3 will already have begun. 3 Kicking to maintain momentum Top swimmers kick underwater to maintain speed and delay the moment when they come back to the surface. Some swimmers do this using a flutter kick, most prefer to use butterfly kicks. If you have enough breath for this, experiment to see which suits you best. 4 Surfacing strongly Getting maximum drive from the wall requires striking a balance between distance and speed. Never let yourself slow down underwater to such an extent that you’re gliding slower than you would be swimming. It’s important to get back to the surface while you’re still travelling at a good speed. Otherwise, your first few strokes will be spent

QUALITY Whenever you’re doing any of the exercises or drills in this book (or any others that you’ve developed for yourself), try to make an active decision not to go fast. There’s an old saying that applies here: ‘First, do it. Then, do it right. Last, do it fast.’ Technique work falls into the second category: do it right. If you try to add speed, it will detract from your ability to control your movements with precision. Top tip --- Page 177 Text --- For most people, it’s worthwhile getting an experienced coach to provide an analysis of your style, and give you key areas for improvement. Try to limit these to three key elements, for example: 1 KEEP YOUR HEAD ANGLE LOWER, BY LOOKING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL RATHER THAN AHEAD 2 PLACE YOUR HAND IN THE WATER IN FRONT OF YOUR SHOULDER 3 STOP BENDING YOUR KNEES WHEN YOU KICK Think about the three key improvements whenever you swim, rather than only when you are specifically working on your technique.

Tread water in the deep end, then take a deep breath and allow yourself to float vertical in the water. Immediately begin to breathe out in a controlled, steady way. Keep breathing out until you start to sink (it may take longer than you expect). You’re aiming to sink to the bottom and sit there cross-legged. • 8 × 25m, 15-second gap between each 25m Follow the flutter-kick drill. Each time you take a breath and your face goes back in the water, begin to breathe out steadily as in the sinking practice above. Only lift your head when you need to take a breath. --- Page 180 Text --- (Notice how lifting your head to breathe affects the angle and action of your leg kick: your legs sink lower, and you start to bend your knees more, both of which cause drag.)

Ideally, the first set would be done with a swimming snorkel, if you have one and they’re allowed in your local pool.

Whether or not you have a swimming snorkel on, remember to keep breathing out a steady stream of air. This stops your upper body from being too buoyant, and helps you to relax your torso and keep it still. Your movement should be from the hips, with stiff knees and loose --- Page 181 Text --- ankles. Set 2 • 4 × (3 × 25m), 20-second gap between each 75m This set is in parcels of three lengths. Swim the first length following the flutter-kick drill but without a swimming snorkel. Hold a pull buoy on top of your kickboard (this is just to get it down to the other end of the pool, so you only have to do it on this first length of the set). For the second length, put your float on the side of the pool and put the pull buoy between your legs, then swim back arms-only (some people like to put the buoy between their calves, rather than their thighs). For the final length, put the pull buoy on the side of the pool and swim full stroke. As you swim the third

All these DVDs are available in our store at www.swimsmooth.com/products --- Page 25 Text --- CHAPTER 2 Introduction to Freestyle Swimming The Freestyle swim stroke, often called Front Crawl in many parts of the world, is the fastest of the four competitive strokes and also the one best suited to long distance events. In the elite swimming world it is the only stroke that is raced for distances of 400 m and longer. Freestyle is unique in that the swimmer has their face in the water for most of the stroke before rotating to the side to breathe very low to the surface. Breathing is a significant challenge when learning freestyle and the struggle to get enough air, without taking on water, is a dominant feature of many beginners’ experiences. Freestyle is the fastest of the four competition strokes. The body rotates along the long axis of the spine during the stroke, which helps the swimmer engage their chest, back and core muscles effectively on every stroke. The lack of vertical movement in comparison to butterfly or breaststroke allows good swimmers to sit very high in the water minimising their drag profile. In comparison to backstroke, freestyle has biomechanical advantages, allowing a better propulsive technique in the water. For triathlon and open water swimming, freestyle is a

The lack of vertical movement in comparison to butterfly or breaststroke allows good swimmers to sit very high in the water minimising their drag profile. In comparison to backstroke, freestyle has biomechanical advantages, allowing a better propulsive technique in the water. For triathlon and open water swimming, freestyle is a much more compact and ‘narrow’ stroke than butterfly and breaststroke making it ideal for swimming in close confines to other swimmers and obviously has significant sighting advantages for holding a straight line between points over swimming on your back in backstroke. --- Page 26 Text --- ADAM: If you can swim breaststroke comfortably but are new to freestyle you’ll find it a revelation when you get the hang of it. With practice you will be able to feel a real sense of rhythm in the stroke without the stop-go action of breaststroke. It’s a bit like breaking out into a run after walking. As we will see in this book, the exact freestyle technique used by great swimmers varies depending on the race distance, the race environment (e.g. pool vs. open water) and to some extent personal preference. However, the key elements of a great stroke are common between all these great swimmers. Swimming Terminology As coaches and swimmers we have names for each area of the stroke and conventions we use for elements like your swimming speed and the length of your stroke as you swim. Don’t be put off by this, this ‘jargon’ is pretty simple and makes a lot of sense when you get the hang of it. The good news is that, for the large part, the terminology used in this book is common all over the world which means you should be able to understand most things written on the internet about swimming and coaching

the thinking behind the system and how it was created: --- Page 143 Text --- PAUL: Coming from a competitive swimming background as a kid growing up in the UK, I always found it fascinating to see how different body types and builds gravitated towards each of the four competitive strokes – butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle. The tallest swimmers with great hip flexibility tended to excel at breaststroke; the tall, muscular swimmers with great kicks were strong in the freestyle and backstroke sprint events; and the shorter, stockier swimmers with good upper-body flexibility tended to be good at butterfly. Being a little vertically challenged myself (compared to some of my giant-like rivals!) my best events were the 100 m and 200 m butterfly and the longer distance freestyle events. I could not seem to sprint like the other guys no matter how much speed work I put in but ask me to move along at a moderately fast pace and maintain this for repetition after repetition, well that I could do! Still, there were no prizes for being good at training or having a good work ethic – all that counted was who was first to the touch pads. Proudly representing Bridlington Swimming Club aged 9 (centre) I couldn’t change my growth rate or the size of my feet but swimming would have been a lot less frustrating had I been shown how genetics potentially predisposed me to one stroke or distance of event over another. I certainly wouldn’t have kept trying to become a super-quick 50 m freestyle specialist against my 1.9 m / 6′ 4″ rivals! What’s more, the recommended stroke style and technique that worked for these guys just didn’t seem to work for me. As a junior I was told by my coaches that my

The Smooth Swim Type is what everybody thinks of when they imagine a long efficient stroke style. They are the envy of the pool with their relaxed style moving them seemingly effortlessly through the water accompanied by a 6-beat kick. They are strong technically in all areas with great turns and starts, and they are normally competitive at backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly as well as freestyle. Most elite pool swimmers are Smooths, with all time greats such as Ian Thorpe and Alexander Popov typifying this category. Although many observers believe this style of stroke is very efficient and therefore well suited to distance swimming, in practice the opposite is true, most elite Smooths excel as sprinters and middle distance (200 m / 400 m) freestylers. Nearly all Smooths have a significant childhood swimming background, very few adults have been able to develop their strokes to this level without such a background, although it is possible. Smooths are talented athletes with excellent technical skills, coordination and awareness of their body movements in the water. When making modifications to their stroke Smooths are able to do so quickly and easily once they understand what they need to do. The Smooth stroke style is certainly efficient but that does not make it ‘effortless’ as many other swimmers might believe. A Smooth will tell you how hard they are actually working when they swim, it’s their huge control and technical ability that makes the stroke appear effortless from the outside. Think of their movements as being like those of an Olympic gymnast or ballet dancer — they have tremendous grace and poise but to do so they are using strength and control. --- Page 177 Text --- Olympian Jono Van Hazel shows us his classical high elbow recovery.

Note: you do not have to attempt to add in a full twist at this point so that your feet would be pointing to 6 o’clock. 7. Aim to make contact with the wall with your knees bent at about 90° — much more or less than this and you will struggle to get a good drive off the wall. 8. As you drive off the wall, strive to stretch out in a full torpedo (streamlined) position. Add in a few freestyle flutter kicks or dolphin (butterfly) kicks to emphasise your speed off the wall and rotate fully back onto your front. 9. Maintain the streamlined torpedo and aim to break out into your full stroke at about 5 m (15 feet) from the wall. Dives Some swim squads like to finish a session with some sprints from the deep end of the pool from a dive start — these are great fun and they sharpen up your pool skills. --- Page 240 Text --- Whilst not compulsory, learning to dive properly can be a lot of fun and if you are planning on racing in the pool it will really give you a good advantage especially in the shorter sprint events. IMPORTANT: Always ensure that you check the depth of water that you are diving into and that there are no foreign obstacles or other swimmers that might get in your way and cause you harm. There is a risk of neck and spinal injury from diving into any body of water but if the depth is greater than 1.8 m (6 ft) and

reaching either side of the feet as you fold yourself over at the waist; 2) the competition start — feet about shoulder width apart and hands reaching between the feet, using the lip of the block to pull up against and gain traction on the block and coil the body like a tight spring; 3) the track start (shown) — a similar hand position as the classic start, but one foot is placed back in a similar stance to how a track runner might start — this will typically be your strongest leg. Experiment and see which gives you the fastest reaction time and power off the blocks. 3. The starter will start you off with the instruction ‘take your marks. . .’ and then follow with either a whistle, gun blast or a simple ‘go!’ 4. Keep your chin tucked into your chest and spring your arms out in front of you to form a streamlined torpedo whilst driving off the block with the legs aiming for both a little height and a good bit of distance. If you lift your head and look forward too much you will cause your legs to drop too low and you will hit the water stomach and chest first (the ‘belly flop’). Tucking your chin in too tightly and spearing the water at too great an angle will force you into a nose dive and send you too deep into the water. 5. Once in the water, keep your hands together and commence a powerful kick to maintain your speed before breaking out into your full stroke just as per any normal push-off.

commence a powerful kick to maintain your speed before breaking out into your full stroke just as per any normal push-off. In our Swim Smooth Perth squad sessions we perform very little of the other three competitive strokes: butterfly, backstroke and breaststroke. Whilst these strokes can benefit your freestyle by developing better muscular balance across the body, if you are only swimming two or three times per week and training for a triathlon or open water swimming event, we would advise you to keep your training as specific as possible and focus on mastering the freestyle stroke. However, it is still useful to know some tips on performing the other three strokes and using them in your warm-ups, and particularly cool-downs, as a good way to vary your programme. Butterfly — often seen as the hardest competitive stroke, butterfly can be challenging because it requires excellent rhythm and timing, good flexibility and a strong leg kick. The stroke undulates around the short axis of the spine and in this respect is more similar to breaststroke than freestyle and backstroke. The best way of visualising a good butterfly stroke is to think of yourself moving through the water like a dolphin. Both arms work together above and below the water with a more rounded recovery than in freestyle — probably one of the reasons why many Swingers are good at butterfly! You do need to be cautious, however, as the lack of long axis rotation in butterfly can increase the load on your shoulders so you should limit the volume of butterfly in your programme. Performing butterfly with fins is a great way to develop a feel for the undulated action of the stroke, it can also tone up your midsection and when done gently can help to --- Page 242

on your shoulders so you should limit the volume of butterfly in your programme. Performing butterfly with fins is a great way to develop a feel for the undulated action of the stroke, it can also tone up your midsection and when done gently can help to --- Page 242 Text --- loosen off a tight lower back. The key to a good butterfly stroke is to ensure that as your head comes up out of the water to take a breath, you do this quickly and focus on getting your chin down onto your chest as quickly as you can. This will help the torso dive back down into the water and assist the arms with their recovery over the top of the surface. The key to butterfly is to breathe and then quickly drop your chin back down onto your chest. Backstroke — very similar to freestyle with respect to long axis rotation, backstroke is effectively the reverse of freestyle and is often used as a way of stretching out during a cool-down and working the muscles in the opposite direction. To be good at backstroke having a strong leg kick is essential. If you don’t have a strong kick and want to try some of the beneficial aspects of the stroke then try wearing a pair of fins. Another important feature of backstroke is to keep your head back. We often tell the children who we work with to imagine that they have to keep their noses in the air like a ‘posh’ person would walk around. This stops the common mistake of bringing the chin towards the chest, which causes the swimmer to sit up in the water and drop the legs and buttocks down low. Breaststroke — whilst used by many swimmers who cannot swim

a bowl of cake mix with your hands as they pull through to develop this motion! A fast breaststroke uses a snappy arm movement, returning to the front of the stroke as soon as possible. Individual Medley — Swimmers can bring all four competitive strokes together and perform an Individual Medley (‘IM’) which consists of 25 m, 50 m or 100 m of each stroke in succession without stopping in the following order: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle. If performed as part of a medley relay team with three other --- Page 244 Text --- swimmers, the order of the strokes is slightly different: backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, freestyle. For more experienced swimmers, completing a 400 m IM always proves to be a good challenge and is worth swimming every now and then to spice up your training regime. The Most Important Walk in Swimming It might be as little as 10 metres but the walk from the changing rooms to the pool can really define your swimming. If you’ve been learning freestyle or working on improving your stroke then you should feel proud of yourself. Most people in the world cannot swim and many in the Western world do absolutely no exercise at all. You may not be the fastest swimmer in the world but that is absolutely fine thank you — so start walking out onto the pool deck tall and proud. Like your mum used to say: ‘head up, shoulders back, chest forwards!’ A final tip: guys, don’t forget to shave that 5 o’clock shadow before you swim! Adopting some positive body language and being confident in what you are doing will make a real difference when you start swimming. For one thing it will improve the positivity and rhythm in your stroke, which can only be good for

Page 9 Text --- This page intentionally left blank --- Page 10 Text --- Climbing the Steps to Swimming Success Swimming has been practiced as both a sport and a recreational activity for thou- sands of years. People at the highest levels of competition swim with such grace and ease that it seems almost effortless. For a beginner or novice, on the other hand, swimming may seem like an exhausting chore that can be done well only by people who possess a natural talent for it. The truth, however, is that anyone can learn to swim—and swim well. With this goal in mind, Swimming: Steps to Success shows you how to feel more comfortable in an aquatic environment and takes you through a progression of skills for each of the competitive strokes. Step 1 starts with the basics—floating and finding your natural buoyancy. Step 2 addresses ways of manipulating the water for propulsion. Steps 3 through 6 cover the fundamentals of the four competitive strokes—freestyle, backstroke, breast- stroke, and butterfly. Steps 7 and 8 focus on turns and starts, and step 9 addresses open-water and survival swimming. Step 10, the final step, gives you some guidance for continuing your swimming journey. The Steps to Success approach to swimming is systematic in building on a solid foundation of skills and techniques. Each step should be approached in the following manner: 1. Carefully read all material in the step. 2. Study the technique photos and, if necessary, use a mirror or a friendly observer to duplicate them yourself. 3. Study the common errors that coaches look for so that you can avoid them! 4. When reading about and executing the drills, keep in mind that they are often designed as “overcorrections” for a specific technique flaw. Drills are intended to help you

move- ments that are not part of any other athletic activity. Be patient with yourself; the key is your progress. As with any journey, no matter how long or short, this one begins with the first step. x --- Page 12 Text --- The Sport of Swimming This book is a guide to help you better understand the fundamentals of swim- ming, which can be defined simply as the act of propelling oneself through the water. Because an instructional book cannot reasonably address all of the rules and regulations applied to swimming, this introduction provides an overview of the sport and introduces certain swimming terms commonly used by coaches and swim- mers. Throughout the rest of the book, each term is further defined in the context in which it is typically used. The sport of swimming has been around for thousands of years, dating back at least to 36 BCE, when Japanese people held organized swimming contests. From then right up until today, it has been a very simple matter to determine the winner of a swimming contest: whoever finishes first! Over the years, races have covered a variety of distances, ranging from about 25 yards (23 m) to lengths that could be measured in miles or kilometers. Races can be further separated into disciplines, or strokes; they can also involve medleys, in which various strokes are used, and team relay races. In modern swim- ming, the strokes include freestyle (also known as the front crawl), backstroke, breast- stroke, and butterfly. Modern rules dictate the specifics of format, but the essential structure of each race is the same: a start, a swim, and a finish.

butterfly. Modern rules dictate the specifics of format, but the essential structure of each race is the same: a start, a swim, and a finish. The AquATiC environmenT Swimming differs from other sports in several ways. For one thing, swimming is not necessarily a natural activity for human beings. Indeed, humans bear little resem- blance to species that are geared to operate in an aquatic environment; for example, fish don’t have necks. As a result, in order to swim, we humans must make some adaptations—in part to accommodate our differences but also to take advantage of them. For success in swimming, you must first become comfortable in the aquatic envi- ronment, which differs dramatically from the land-based environment in which we typically operate on a daily basis. It is easier to do so if you understand the key dif- ferences between humans and aquatic creatures. First, as mostly terrestrial creatures, we walk upright, and our natural position for most of our waking hours is basically vertical. In the water, however, most of what we do involves being horizontal, and this difference takes some getting used to for most people. In addition, in many sports, success depends largely on strength and speed. In swimming, however, there is nothing solid to push against; therefore, though strength does matter in swimming, it is much more important to apply pressure to the water in the correct way. Because water is a fluid, it moves around you rather xi --- Page 13 Text --- The Sport of Swimming than resolutely resisting you in the way that a solid does. Similarly, speed in swim- ming comes not necessarily from moving your body parts faster but from using your movements to put pressure on the water in an effective manner. As anyone who has participated in water

buoys, and snorkels. Kickboards The kickboard (figure 2) is a fairly common piece of equipment found in many swim- mers’ training bags. It is typically made of some sort of foam to provide flotation. Its purpose is to provide a buoyancy assist so that swimmers can isolate and train the kicking motion. It is often used to train all four competitive strokes. Figure 2 Two different styles of kickboards. xv --- Page 17 Text --- The Sport of Swimming Fins Fins are commonly used in swim training to add resistance to the kicking motion, helping the person to swim more easily or to make the workout harder. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes (figure 3), and some are designed specifically for a cer- tain competitive stroke—for example, the monofin and the breaststroke fin. Monof- ins are a training tool specific to dolphin kick. Breastroke fins are also very specific to that kick and, due to the increase in pressure on the groin area and the inside of the knee, should probably be used only under the supervision of a knowledgeable coach and with a swimmer who has had sufficient technique training and the strength to benefit from the extra resistance. For training purposes, fins with medium-size blades work for most swimmers, though it is a good idea to use shorter blades in the beginning in order to prevent injury. People who have less strength or flexibility in the lower extremities—especially the ankles—should definitely use a medium or shorter blade of 6 to 9 inches (about 15 to 23 centimeters) to prevent overstressing those joints with the added pressure and resistance created by longer blades (often seen in scuba shops). In addition, short-blade fins (shorter than 6 inches, or 15 cen- timeters) are often used to work with

Some of the drills do not resemble swimming, but they show you how manipulating your body position and putting pressure on the water in different ways can help you achieve your goal of success in swimming! 20 --- Page 40 Text --- Step 2 Manipulating the Water The goal of this second step is to increase your awareness of drag force, propul- sive force, and how specific movements create propulsion and minimize drag. In other words, this step helps you understand how to use your body’s surfaces to apply pressure on the water in order to move through it. By the end of this step, you should be able to • achieve an aquatic position that minimizes drag; • get a feel for the water and where it slips off of your hands when anchoring your hands during the crucial catch phase of a stroke; • use a sculling motion for propulsion; and • use flutter, dolphin, and breaststroke kicks for propulsion, both on your back and on your front.

catch phase of a stroke; • use a sculling motion for propulsion; and • use flutter, dolphin, and breaststroke kicks for propulsion, both on your back and on your front. Drag Force anD ProPulsive Force Drag force slows you down, whereas propulsive force makes you move. Drag force is easy to understand if you think in terms of skydiving. While falling, skydivers accel- erate due to gravity. They accelerate more if they make themselves skinny and verti- cal (i.e., streamlined), thereby minimizing their cross-sectional area (the area facing in their direction of travel) and in turn minimizing the resistance or drag force that acts on them. On the other hand, if they spread their arms and legs out and become more horizontal, they maximize the area that is perpendicular to their direction of fall and thus slow down due to air resistance. At some point, our daredevils deploy their parachutes, greatly increasing their cross-sectional area, in order to slow down even more and avoid plummeting to their doom. What does this have to do with swimming? Aerodynamics and hydrodynamics have a lot in common! The big difference lies in the fact that water is about 750 times denser than air and therefore involves much higher drag force. This strong resistance is the reason that high divers can slow down so quickly upon entering the water even at very high speeds. Of course, it also slows down swimmers. At the same time, however, water gives swimmers a denser surface upon which to apply pressure than air does. Swimmers can take advantage of this density by using 21 --- Page 41 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success propulsive force to their advantage. Specifically, they apply pressure to the water in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction in which they want

### Swimming STEPS TO SUCCESS_full_text.txt
pressure on the water via both up and down movements. The more surfaces you engage in applying pressure, the better. The basic idea here is to initiate the kick in the hip; it is also helpful to use the strong muscles of the core for propulsion, and that technique is addressed in future steps. For now, focus on the basics of kicking as a propulsive force. The following drill progression helps you master the flutter kick. The first part of the progression helps you develop an effective mental image of what your legs are 29 --- Page 49 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success supposed to do. Of course, creatures evolved for swimming use well-adapted body parts to make movements that are long and fluid—for example, the movements of a fish, dolphin, or whale tail. Humans are at a disadvantage in this regard because we have solid bones in our legs rather than reticulated vertebrae, making us less flexible for fluid movement. In compensating for this deficit, it helps to envision the move- ment that you want. You might imagine, for instance, that the knee and ankle of each leg are connected by a rubber band. This image helps you keep your legs long and loose as you drive motion from your lower core. Figure 2.4 FluTTer KicKing Preparation 1. Get in the water and grab the gutter. 2. From a standing position facing the wall, kick your legs up to the surface and make your body horizontal (parallel to the pool bottom). 3. At this stage, it is okay to use your fore- arms and the wall to help you achieve a a horizontal position and to have your head out of the water. 4. Keep your legs as long and loose as possible (do not actively point your

right places and recruit the proper muscles. As with kicking on your front, imagine the joints of each leg being connected by a rubber band; staying long and loose is still a key. Remember both your mental image and the feeling of pressure on the water from both the tops and the bottoms of your feet. Ensure that your toes just break the surface. As before, big splashes do not provide propulsive force and should be avoided. Kicking with your feet and legs coming out of the water makes big splashes. Since you are on your back, your toes will be the first to break the surface. As land-based creatures, we tend to have a natural affinity for leading this kick with the heel, as in a running or cycling motion. In correcting this tendency, it can be helpful to work with a kickboard (as described in the following Missteps section). MissTeP You make big splashes while kicking with your heels first. correcTion Focus on the analogy of a whale or dolphin tail and try to replicate its long, fluid up-and-down motion. 34 --- Page 54 Text --- Manipulating the Water Figure 2.6 FluTTer KicKing on your BacK Preparation 1.

in which your head, knees, and toes are up. Release the hand from the wall, touch your hands together under the water, and push off in a streamlined position while keeping your head down. Kick underwater for as long as you can before needing a breath; keep your legs long and loose and kick both up and down.

DolPhin KicK The next propulsive motion to learn is that of the dolphin, or butterfly, kick. Though somewhat similar to the flutter kick, this technique for manipulating the water is a little more difficult to master. Instead of alternating the legs, this kick keeps the legs together as if they were bonded, thus mimicking closely the motion of a dolphin’s tale. The advantage of this kick is that it applies more surface area to the water to produce more propulsive force. Dolphin Kicking at the Wall Unlike the flutter kick, this kick (figure 2.7) derives its power from the middle part of the core—from the lower part of the rib cage down through the pelvis. Let the strong muscles of your core initiate most of the work. Your legs should stay together the entire time, and, as with the flutter kick, they

Your legs should stay together the entire time, and, as with the flutter kick, they should be long and loose. A good mental image for this kick is the motion of a dolphin or whale; try to mimic that motion with your body, from your chest on down. Some swimmers also find it help- ful to imagine that their legs are glued together and cannot be separated. To work on this skill, use the same progression used for the flutter kick on your front. 37 --- Page 57 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 2.7 DolPhin KicKing aT The Wall Preparation 1.

The next part is to make sure that the kick you are developing is propulsive. You should be in the same extended streamlined position that you developed in step 1. If your hands are grabbing the wall and hanging on instead of being pushed toward it, do a simple hands-to-toes check for proper positioning. 38 --- Page 58 Text --- Manipulating the Water Dolphin Kicking Away From the Wall Once you have gone through these helpful cues and can feel the pressure you are applying to the water, it is time for the real test of propulsive force, butterfly kicking away from the wall (figure 2.8).

Dolphin Kicking on Your Back Dolphin kicking on your back (figure 2.9) differs only slightly from kicking on your front. As before, developing an appropriate mental image for the action can help you apply pressure in the right places and recruit the proper muscles. The mental image here, as with kicking on your front, is to think of your leg joints as being connected by a rubber band; staying long and loose is still a key. Misstep The water washes back up to your face. CorreCtion The two most likely culprits are your knees breaking the surface of the water and the tops of your feet “pushing” at the water.

Now try the kicking motion again; if you feel your knees touch- ing the board and making it bounce up and down, you are not finish- ing you kick underwater and are probably leading with your heels or bicycling your kick. 40 --- Page 60 Text --- Manipulating the Water Figure 2.9 Dolphin KicKing on Your BacK Preparation 1.

As your feet get to the surface, keep in mind that your goal is to put pressure on the water, which means that your legs must be in the water. The keys here are to sustain a steady rhythmic kick (do not worry about being fast just yet) that feels like you are putting pressure on the water all the way down your leg.

the water all the way down your leg. Once you have mastered this skill, it is time to move on to the next part of the progression. 41 --- Page 61 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Dolphin Kick Drill 1 Kickboard The next part of the progression is to ensure that your kick is indeed propulsive. In the water, use a kickboard for balance only, placing your hands on the lower corners of the board. Facing away from the wall, pull your feet up, place them on the wall, and push off on your front. Make sure that your face is in the water and look directly at the bottom of the pool. Now begin the same rhythmic kicking motion that you developed earlier in this progression. It should propel you down the length of the pool at a very slow speed. If you come to a stop or even go backward, check for correct positioning from your hands to your toes. Many swimmers come to the pool with a limited range of motion in the ankles. Make sure that your ankles are slightly plantar-flexed, so that your toes point away from your body but not so much as to make your legs rigid. When you need to breathe, simply apply pressure to the kickboard and lift your head for air. Make this motion quick in order to maintain your balance in the water and get your face back in the water to stabilize your balance.

The new challenge here is that when you breathe, you should use the same sculling motion described earlier in this step.

Competitive freestyle was born in the late 1800s, when John Arthur Trudgen witnessed native South Amer- icans swimming with an overhand recovery and a wide, scissorlike kick. He carried the stroke back to England, where it took on his name despite being characterized as un-European barbaric thrashing. Around the turn of the century in Australia, a similar stroke was used with a flutter kick by a Solomon Islander named Alick Wickham. That version was devel- oped further by coach Richmond “Dick” Cavill into what we now recognize

mimicking the motions of a frog, though the modern version differs somewhat in terms of the kick. In any case, it can be traced back at least to the Stone Age, when cave paintings were made in what is now western Egypt to depict people using the stroke. The breaststroke was also the only stroke used for the first recorded crossing of the Eng- lish Channel by a swimmer. There are several advantages: It is possible to breathe after every stroke, see where you are going, and use the stroke for survival and safety once you know how to do this stroke effectively. Though it is technically the slowest of the four competi- tive strokes, its subtleties and nuances make it arguably the most complex as well. Though everyone can learn to do the breaststroke—and should, since a slower vari- ant of it is essential in swimming long distances when necessary—learning to swim it fast takes a great deal of patience and time. Breaststroke and butterfly are considered “short-axis” strokes but are really tim- ing-and-rhythm strokes. Granted, you do rotate on a shorter axis (i.e., through the chest, laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes: • Good body position • Effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Kicking rhythm • Effective breathing • Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these components, you are well on your way to an effective breaststroke. The breaststroke is the only one of the four competitive strokes that derives its propulsive force equally from the pull and the kick; therefore, you should give equal attention to both elements. This double focus is one factor that makes the

Point the feet and toes in opposite directions away from the midline of the body. 3. Push the heels out while keeping the knees tucked in. 4. Sweep the heels together while pushing against the water with the insides of the b calves and the instep of the foot. 5. Hold the position, glide, and then repeat. c 100 --- Page 120 Text --- Breaststroke MissTep You draw the knees outside before the heels. correcTion Leading with the knees causes you to wedge the water with the whole leg and places an increased stress on the hips. Instead, think of the knees as being separated by the width of just your hands. Alternately, placing a small buoy higher above the knees when kick- ing during the breaststroke will accomplish the same thing. Many swimmers experience the following problems in kicking with the breaststroke. To avoid these common mistakes, review the drills from step 2. • Kicking “out” as if doing a side kick rather than anchoring the instep and pushing • Bringing the heels up either too far or not far enough • Kicking with the toes pointed • Drawing out with the knees rather than keeping them in • Keeping the legs together • Not controlling the core and thus making the finish more of a dolphin kick Keep these pitfalls in mind in order to avoid later problems that can result from the lack of an effective propulsive kick. Drills for kickinG As mentioned in step 2 (manipulating the water), a good propulsive breaststroke kick is all about putting pressure on the water with the legs from the knee down.

The following drills will help you establish a good head position and help with breathing. Breathing Drill Tennis Ball 2 This drill helps you maintain proper head position while going to get air or breathing in breaststroke. To perform the drill, place a tennis ball beneath your chin and hold it to your chest. This action keeps your neck in line and prevents you from coming up too high when you breathe. Swim the regular breaststroke and try breathing both earlier in the stroke and later in the stroke to find out which works best for you. Avoid pushing down on the water with your palms.

Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 2 Two kicks per stroke This classic breaststroke drill increases your awareness of timing and body posi- tion; it also helps you with balance. It is performed by simply kicking twice in the stretched-out position with your hands far forward (but not on top of each other) and kicking twice per catch–pull sequence. Keep your head down with a long neck during each pair of kicks. To increase DifficulTy • Count to “three hippopotamus.” To Decrease DifficulTy • Use a pull buoy far above your knees and kick. 110 --- Page 130 Text --- Breaststroke Success Check Score Your Success • You can perform the drill while 1 point: You can go 10 yards. maintaining a long body line. 3 points: You can go 25 yards. • You do not move your hands 5 points: You can go 25 yards in 10 or and feet at the same time. more pulls. 7 points: You can go 25 yards in 9 or fewer pulls.

BreasTsTroKe PullouT The modern breaststroke is done with what is referred to as a pullout (figure 5.4), both at the start and during each turn at the wall. To perform the pullout, the swim- mer pushes off the wall underwater (or starts from a dive) in a streamlined position. As the hands separate, they can pull all the way down to the hips just once. The swimmer is allowed to perform one dolphin kick at any time in this part. As the swimmer slows, the hands are brought up the body and close to the body to get into a breast stroke swimming position with the hands out in front. It is at this point that the stroke as described earlier actually begins. 111 --- Page 131 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 5.4 BreasTsTroke pullouT Preparation 1.

It was developed in the 1930s as a way to minimize the drag caused by underwater recovery of the arms in the breaststroke. Early variants of the butterfly (referred to as the butterfly breaststroke) used an over-the-water recovery with a breaststroke kick. This technique was much faster than the breaststroke but required a great deal of strength. It was not until the 1950s that the butterfly was con- sidered a separate stroke from breaststroke, and the use of a dolphin kick was added to the official competition rules governing the new stroke. As mentioned in step 5, the butterfly, like the breaststroke, is considered a “short- axis” stroke but is really a timing-and-rhythm stroke. It does involve rotating on a shorter axis (i.e., through the chest, laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes: • Good body position • Effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Acceleration throughout the stroke •

laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes: • Good body position • Effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Acceleration throughout the stroke • Kicking rhythm • Effective breathing • Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective butterfly. The basic motion of the butterfly involves an undulating rhythm in which the legs and arms are synchronized by precise timing. The most important element of a good butterfly stroke is the use of the body’s core, which is the greatest source of power. Here are the basic movements as you flow through the stroke. From the neutral position described in step 1—facedown in the water with your arms stretched out above your head—press your chest down toward the pool bottom. To help you do so, you can use a downward motion of your feet with your legs together in a dol- phin-kick downstroke. Next, push your hips down while arching your back to bring your head and chest back toward the surface. Again, you are encouraged to use your legs in a dol- phin-kick upstroke; you should feel some pressure on the backs of your legs and the bottoms of your feet. You use the dolphin kick here both to provide propulsive force and to manipulate the position of your center of buoyancy to produce an undulating motion. 115 --- Page 135 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success As you complete the undulating and kicking motion, pitch your fingers down toward the bottom of the pool and bend at the elbows in a motion similar to that of pushing yourself up out of

to produce an undulating motion. 115 --- Page 135 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success As you complete the undulating and kicking motion, pitch your fingers down toward the bottom of the pool and bend at the elbows in a motion similar to that of pushing yourself up out of the pool. Once your hands and forearms are close to verti- cal, push back while accelerating your hands and arms. The propulsive force of your hands and forearms—along with a slight forward push of your chin—causes you to rise out of the water high enough to get a breath. The last element involves acceleration of your hands past your hips and out of the water. With your head and shoulders out of the water, a forceful movement of your hands at the finish allows you to recover your arms in a straight fashion. The arms remain straight rather than bent over and parallel to the surface of the water. The entry of your hands and arms should be above your head in front of your shoulders, if not a little wider, thus returning you to your original neutral position to begin the next stroke cycle. You will practice each of these elements in the following sections, which include drills to help you master each element and culminate in a discussion of putting it all together. Dolphin KicK Unlike the flutter kick, the dolphin kick derives its power from the middle part of your core—from the lower part of your rib cage down through your pelvis. In addi- tion, your legs stay together the whole time. The basic motion involves driving your hips back and forth with the strong muscles of your core and using your legs merely to finish off the kick. Your legs should be long and loose; let

cage down through your pelvis. In addi- tion, your legs stay together the whole time. The basic motion involves driving your hips back and forth with the strong muscles of your core and using your legs merely to finish off the kick. Your legs should be long and loose; let your strong core muscles initiate most of the work. A good mental image for this kick is the motion of a dolphin or whale. Try to mimic that motion with your body, from your chest on down. Some swimmers also find it helpful to imagine that their legs are glued together and cannot be separated. In this step, you will work on the following skills: 1. Developing a propulsive and symmetrical kick 2. Laying your hands on the water and achieving a good catch position 3. Getting from the catch to the pull and making sure that the force is applied in the correct direction 4. Accelerating your hands through the pull 5. Synchronizing the kick and the pull 6. Effective breathing 7. Recovery of the arms Dolphin Kick With Face Out of Water The key here is to sustain a steady rhythmic kick (don’t think about speed just yet) that feels like you are putting pressure on the water all the way down your leg. Remember to start the kick with your core and move fluidly down through your legs. Once you have mastered this motion (figure 6.1), it is time to move on to the next part of the progression. 116 --- Page 136 Text --- Butterfly Figure 6.1 Dolphin KicK WiTh Face ouT oF WaTer Preparation 1.

The goal is to kick in a streamlined position. If you were able to do so with a kickboard, then this transition should be a little easier. The new challenge here is that when you breathe, you should use the same sculling motion described earlier in step 2: Simply sweep your hands out and in rhythmically to apply enough pressure on the water to allow you to lift your head for a quick breath. Once you have mastered this technique—and it may take a few tries—it is time to move to dolphin kicking on your back. Figure 6.4 Dolphin KicK WiThouT KicKBoarD Preparation 1.

The upstroke of the kick is propulsive, whereas the downstroke is used to propel the arms in the recovery and entry. Once again, it is helpful to develop an effective mental image. As with kicking on your front, imagine the joints of each leg being connected by a rubber band; staying long and loose is still a key.

Many swimmers start off stiff and mechanical in their kicking rhythm; with practice, however, they develop a smoother and much more propulsive kick. Here are a few drills to help you master this skill. Dolphin Kicking Drill 1 Vertical Kicking After you have achieved propulsion in dolphin kicking, work on kicking both up and down. This drill helps you develop a symmetrical kick. Find water deep enough to be over your head, then begin by treading water with your head out and using a flutter kick. Once you are comfortable, switch to a dolphin kick. The goal here is to remain stationary in the water without making much use of your hands. If you kick more forcefully in one direction, you will drift around in the pool. Staying in place, on the other hand, means that you are putting pressure on the water with both the fronts and the backs of your legs. You should feel the pres- sure most on the tops and bottoms of your feet, since they are the body parts that finish off the kick. To increase DiFFiculTY • Do not use your hands at all for balance. • Put your hands on top of your head. • Raise your hands straight above you in a streamlined position.

Once you have felt an effective • You feel your body lift slightly out propulsive force with the lower part of of the water. your body, it is time to start working on applying this force in a horizontal rather than a vertical direction. Dolphin Kicking Drill 2 Kick on Your Back This drill helps you continue to develop a symmetrical kick. Now that you feel the pressure on the water, it is time to ensure that it is propulsive pressure by moving through the water. The next part of the progression for an effective dolphin kick is to lie on your back in the neutral position described in step 1 with your hands at your sides for balance. Begin dolphin-kicking with special emphasis on the pressure on the bottoms of your feet. As with the backstroke flutter kick, keep your knees underwater; do not just “push” at the water with the tops of your feet. Some swimmers find it beneficial to think of curling the toes in order to feel the feet in a stretched-out position while keeping the ankles loose. Important note! You will not be able to see where you are going during this drill. Make sure that the backstroke flags are in place—5 yards from the wall—or have your coach or instructor stop you when necessary!

BuTTerFlY arMsTroKe Since its inception, the butterfly armstroke (figure 6.6) has been taught in many ways. In the early years, many instructors advocated an outsweep of the hands and a movement in a keyhole fashion. Later variants included an insweep, as well making almost a figure-eight pattern. The modern butterfly uses more of a straight pull with the maximum amount of arm area perpendicular to the direction in which you are going. 124 --- Page 144 Text --- Butterfly Figure 6.6 BuTTerFlY arMsTroKe Preparation 1.

BuTTerFlY arM recoVerY Many swimmers struggle with arm recovery (figure 6.7) if they perform the pull incorrectly. It is easy for the arms to recover over the water if the hands accelerate through the stroke and finish at or slightly wider than the hips. The reason is that the momentum of the stroke carries the hands through the exit, which means that less effort is required to bring the arms and hands back to the forward position. The key is to finish the stroke fast and feather the hands so that they exit the water smoothly, pinkies out first.

is required to bring the arms and hands back to the forward position. The key is to finish the stroke fast and feather the hands so that they exit the water smoothly, pinkies out first. If the stroke is finished with an acceleration, the forward movement of the arms requires less effort. It should be done in the same position: little fingers up, thumbs down, and forearms and upper arms parallel to the water. The specifics of how the hands enter the water are matters of style. Some swimmers do it thumb first, whereas others rotate the wrists before entry. Regardless of style, one must ensure that the fingers are down as described in the catch-and-pull phase. Therefore, if you use the thumbs-first option, make sure to rotate your fingers and hands to be perpendicular to the direction in which you are traveling. 127 --- Page 147 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 6.7 BuTTerFlY arM recoVerY Preparation 1.

If this movement is done with great force, your hands and arms will recover almost by themselves. If you find yourself struggling to get your hands out of the water, check your positioning and practice the following drills. Butterfly Arm Recovery Drill 1 Dolphin Dive This classic drill helps you get used to the undulating motion and provides buoyant force support while you coordinate the over-the-water recovery. To perform it, stand in waist-deep water with your hands at your sides, then bend at the waist so that your chest is in the water but your shoulders are out. Your chin should touch the water as you look at a spot 8 to 10 inches (20-25 cm) in front of your face. Next, rotate your hands—so that your pinkies are up and your thumbs down— and sweep them forward over the water; near the beginning of the movement, put your face in the water. Now place your hands in the water in front of your shoulders or slightly wider. Push yourself forward off of the bottom and stretch out on the water while pushing your chest and your hips down toward the

### Swimming STEPS TO SUCCESS_full_text.txt
near the beginning of the movement, put your face in the water. Now place your hands in the water in front of your shoulders or slightly wider. Push yourself forward off of the bottom and stretch out on the water while pushing your chest and your hips down toward the bottom. This is the same kicking motion described earlier. Pull yourself forward and, when your hands reach your hips, stop and stand up. Repeating this drill causes an undulating motion that serves as the basis for your stroke and allows you time to isolate the recovery por- tion of the stroke.

you perform all elements of the stroke, except that when you finish the stroke you sweep your hands and arms forward and out to the sides, near the surface of the water but still in it. Start with your hands and arms extended out front and lie on the water in the neutral position. Do a dolphin kick, both up and down, as well as a catch and pull. As you finish the pull, sweep your hands and arms out in a semicircular motion with your arms straight. It is okay for your arms to skim the surface of the water. When your hands reach the front, stop and stand up to reset the stroke. When performing this drill, keep your arms straight and lead with your thumbs while in the water. This technique helps with body positioning so you do not get the body too vertical.

BreaThing The timing of the breath is critical to a good butterfly stroke. As with the breast- stroke, breathing at the wrong time during the butterfly stroke cycle not only slows the stroke but also increases the rate of fatigue. However, whereas mistimed breath- ing in the breaststroke mainly makes you slow, mistimed breathing in the butterfly exhausts you and forces you to stop. 130 --- Page 150 Text --- Butterfly To learn when to breathe and how to do so with proper technique, you use a few simple mental cues and drills (figure 6.8). The first cue addresses how high to rise out of the water when getting air. Rising too high reduces momentum and undulation. As a corrective, think of pushing your chin forward rather than lifting your head. The next concern is the timing of your breathing. Many swimmers breathe late. To avoid this pitfall, initiate the forward chin movement as you start your pull and make it a quick breath. How often you breathe depends on your individual needs and development as a swimmer. Conventional wisdom used to recommend breath- ing on every other stroke and leaving your face in the water rather than getting air on each stroke. However, after several Olympians chose to breathe either on every stroke or in a one-two pattern, it became apparent that butterfly swimmers should breathe as often as they need to—but not more.

152 Text --- Butterfly From the neutral position, push your chest down and your hips up while kicking down, then push your hips down and your chest up while kicking up. Position your fingers down and your elbows up while pushing your chin forward. Pull through and accelerate your hands while coming up for air. Flip your hands and arms out, down past your hips, and around in a sweeping motion while also placing your face back in the water and kicking down again. Drills For TiMing anD rhYThM Here are a few simple drills that you can do to emphasize timing. Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 1 1-2-3-4-5 Butterfly This drill separates the propulsive movements. Perform each distinct movement described in the summary of butterfly rhythm, waiting one or two seconds between movements. As you get more comfortable with the movements and with the timing, reduce the wait interval until you are swimming the full-stroke butterfly. Breathe on every stroke if necessary and less often if possible. To do the drill, lie facedown on the water in the neutral position with your hands in front. Then implement the five elements referred to in the numbers of the drill name (1-2-3-4-5 Butterfly): (1) push your chest down, (2) push your hips down and your chest up, (3) pitch your fingers down, (4) pull through, and (5) recover. The idea here is to slow the movements into separate and distinct actions. You can speed up as you become more comfortable with the rhythm. To increase DiFFiculTY • Speed up the rhythm.

To do it, perform one pull for every four dolphin kicks. This technique isolates your hand positioning upon entry and immediately afterward. Lay your hands on the water directly in front of you so that your arms are above the head in an outstretched position like that of Superman when flying. Perform four dolphin kicks to continue moving forward while adjusting your hands and arms if necessary. If you find yourself having to lift your head and pitch your hands up to get back to the stretched-out position, you are driving the stroke too much with your upper body. Instead, think of laying your hands on the water and landing on your armpits. Remember to breathe only in the beginning part of the stroke. To increase DiFFiculTY • Speed up the rhythm.

In competition, an effective turn saves race time when changing direction. For recreational and fitness swimmers, an effective turn maximizes your workout time and enhances your proficiency in the water. Every turn, regardless of the type, consists of four key elements: 1. Approach

### Swimming STEPS TO SUCCESS_full_text.txt
sure that you are on your side. Open Turn fOr BacksTrOke You can also use an open turn with the backstroke, even in competition (figure 7.4). For safety reasons, you should practice this technique only in a pool equipped with backstroke flags. As mentioned in the backstroke step, these are placed 5 yards from the end of the pool. Swimmers also count strokes from the flags to get to the wall, and for many swimmers it takes about three strokes. 142 --- Page 162 Text --- Turns As you approach on your back, roll toward your side, as in freestyle. Make sure not to go past vertical with your shoulders; that is, remain slightly on your back. The exchange is the same as in freestyle, and the streamline is similar except that you push off slightly on your back. The streamline is faceup, and the breakout is the same as before except this time of course transitioning into the backstroke. Figure 7.4 Open Turn fOr BacksTrOke Preparation 1. When approaching on your back, roll toward your side. Do not go past vertical with your shoulders; instead, remain slightly on your back. 2. Push off slightly on your back. 3.

push, and the second is the kicking. These phases are closely linked; there should be little or no gliding prior to getting into your kicking rhythm. The third phase involves pushing your chin forward to initiate the breakout. Each of these three elements constitutes a separate skill that must be put in place with good timing. Use trial and error to determine how many kicks to perform and when to break the surface. Practice this drill on both your front and your back, using both the flutter kick and the dolphin kick.

TwO-hanD TOuch Turn The two-hand touch turn is the one used in competition and recreational swimming for both the breaststroke and the butterfly. To perform this turn, the approach (figure 7.5) is made on the front, and in competition pools it can be gauged by markings on the pool bottom. Specifically, the centerline of each lane has a T shape close to the wall that provides competitive swimmers with a target. Since both the breaststroke 147 --- Page 167 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success and the butterfly are forward-looking strokes, you can also easily sneak a peek at your distance from the wall. Many pools also have a spillover gutter system or a

that provides competitive swimmers with a target. Since both the breaststroke 147 --- Page 167 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success and the butterfly are forward-looking strokes, you can also easily sneak a peek at your distance from the wall. Many pools also have a spillover gutter system or a low coping that allows you to grasp the wall with your hands. This technique reduces your length and thus the resistance during your turn and causes your feet to come up close to the wall for the exchange. Figure 7.5 TwO-hanD TOuch Turn: apprOach Preparation 1. As you approach the wall, take a final stroke and reach for the wall with both hands. 2. Stretch for the wall rather than taking an additional short stroke. a Execution 1. As your momentum carries you into the wall, grasp it (or push away from it with your hands). 2. Drive your knees up toward your chest. 3. Rotate your feet toward the wall. b MissTep You come to a stop before reaching the wall, or you end up with your face very close to the wall or hit the wall with your arm. cOrrecTiOn Take one more stroke, or one fewer, to adjust your distance. MissTep You have to take a half-stroke because you are too close. cOrrecTiOn It is better to be long on the turn than short. In breaststroke competi- tion, the drag is increased and slows you down, and the pull must also be followed by a kick, according to current rules. This could lead to a disqualification, so it is preferable to glide to the wall. 148 --- Page 168 Text --- Turns During the exchange (figure 7.6), your body rotates and you draw one arm back toward the other end of the pool and then extend your

addition, since you are on your side, you need to rotate to the correct position during the streamline. Also as before, your head position controls your depth on the streamline. 149 --- Page 169 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 7.7 TwO-hanD TOuch Turn: push-Off anD sTreaMLine Preparation Execution 1.

MissTep You rotate on the wall and are facedown. cOrrecTiOn Draw your knees up while twisting only slightly so that you are on your side when you are ready to push. The last part of the turn is the breakout (figure 7.8), in which you transition from the streamlined position to a swimming position. For the butterfly and breaststroke, the first movement is the kick, so you will need to be near the surface. To get there, simply push your chin forward. Please note that you should not necessarily lift your head; instead, bring your chin forward, which causes you to rise to the surface grad- ually. As in all of these breakouts, make sure to be neither too shallow nor too deep. 150 --- Page 170 Text --- Turns Figure 7.8 TwO-hanD TOuch Turn: BreakOuT Preparation 1. Push off in a streamline.

The key is to get on and off of the wall quickly with no energy wasted. With this goal in mind, the best turners avoid having their feet and their hands on the wall at the same time. Work toward that goal as you practice the following drills. 151 --- Page 171 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Two-Hand Touch-Turn Drill 1 approach Both the breaststroke and the butterfly are based on good timing and rhythm, and this holds true for the turn. One of the ways to practice being ready for the turn is to make sure you that are aware of your location as you approach. To do this drill, start 5 to 10 yards from the wall. Push off of the bottom and begin kicking toward the wall to get a feel for the rhythm of your approach. Touch the wall with both hands about shoulder-width apart. Now, try the drill again, but this time add one or two armstrokes. Adjust your distance until you have a good feel for your momentum

to perform. There is, of course, more to it. A successful flip turn depends on keeping your hands stationary and using your core for the turn. The following drills help you keep your core engaged and avoid relying on your hands and arms to manipulate the water. Flip-Turn Drill 1 kickboard The purpose of this drill is to keep your hands in the same place while doing the flip turn. To perform the drill, hold the bottom of a kickboard in each hand. Starting in the middle of the pool, lie on the water facedown with your hands and the kickboards at your sides and your palms and thumbs up. Tuck your chin to your chest and give a little dolphin kick while you bend at the waist. Throw your feet over so that you end up faceup at the top of the water with your arms above your head.

a lot of energy to the start and makes pool depth all the more important. Though traditionally performed from a starting block, this forward dive start can also be done from the side of the pool. Starting blocks may be either removable or permanently installed. They come in a variety of designs, depending on the manufacturer, but generally include a platform angled slightly forward or down toward the water. Some also include a wedge at the back, and this feature is currently considered state of the art for competitive racing blocks. Let’s turn now to the various dive starts. ForWarD or grab Start The forward or grab start (figure 8.3) can be done from the deck or from a block and is used for freestyle, breaststroke, and butterfly. To perform it, stand at the front edge of the block with your toes curled over the edge, then bend at your waist and bend your knees slightly. Next, grab the front edge of the block with both hands; it is very important to keep your neck loose and look down or only slightly forward. This is the set position, in which you should be reasonably comfortable with your center of gravity directly above your feet and ankles. As your feet leave the block, your hips, knees, and ankles should all be on the same line, parallel to the surface of the water, in order to generate maximum forward velocity. Your upper body is angled toward your entry position and your fingers are pointed directly to that spot. As your feet enter the water, you should be 2 to 2.5 feet (0.6-0.75 m) under the sur- face. It will take several attempts to find your ideal depth, which depends on which stroke you are swimming and what is most comfortable to you.

are pointed directly to that spot. As your feet enter the water, you should be 2 to 2.5 feet (0.6-0.75 m) under the sur- face. It will take several attempts to find your ideal depth, which depends on which stroke you are swimming and what is most comfortable to you. After your feet enter the water, you are in the streamline phase. Perform this part of the start as described in the stroke-specific step chapters. 164 --- Page 184 Text --- Starts Remember that at the instant you enter the water, you are traveling at the fast- est speed you will achieve in your swim. Therefore, it is crucial to achieve a tight streamline in order to avoid slowing down and to minimize drag. The streamline for freestyle and butterfly involves powerful kicking at very high frequency, whereas the breaststroke streamline involves the breaststroke pullout. The breakout, once again, is the transition from streamlining to swimming. In all of these strokes, the first few strokes after the streamline are crucial for maintaining the momentum you generated in the start and the streamline. To do so, focus on making your first few strokes powerful and flawless. Figure 8.3 ForWarD or grab Start a bb Set 3. At the same time, bring your hands forward toward the stream- 1.

By the 1990s, the technique had become more widespread, and it is now the standard starting technique for most swimmers.

see which one gets you farther down the pool. After your feet enter the water, you are in the streamline phase. Perform this part of the start as described for each stroke in previous steps. Remember that the instant you enter the water, you are traveling at the fastest speed you will achieve in your swim. Therefore, it is crucial to achieve a tight streamline in order to avoid slowing down and to minimize drag. The streamline for freestyle and butterfly involves pow- erful kicking at very high frequency, whereas the breaststroke streamline involves the breaststroke pullout. The breakout, once again, is the transition phase from streamlining to swimming. As mentioned earlier, push your chin forward slightly to adjust your depth and bring you to the surface for swimming. In all of these swimming strokes, your first few strokes after the streamline are crucial for maintaining the momentum you generated in the start and the streamline. To do so, focus on making your first few strokes powerful and flawless. In addition, this particular type of start involves a few more variables that must be managed. Whether you have your hips forward or back, your timing, and the amount of verti- cal force you put into the start all influence the entry. If your feet do not enter through the same hole in the water as the rest of the body, you may twist, which will influence the way you streamline. You may have to make adjustments with your body and in your streamline to ensure that you can manage the breakout effectively. MISStep You look up, lose your balance, and fall in.

and the start (figure 8.5) is no exception. The backstroke start can be performed from the deck or a block; either way, it is done in the water with the feet on the wall and the back facing down the pool. For the entry, push off and do a back “dive,” which brings you underwater and sets up the streamline. An effective backstroke start begins, of course, with the set. Competitive blocks are outfitted with grab bars for backstroke, but even then some swimmers opt to use the deck. The set is performed by placing the feet flat on the wall with the elbows bent. Next comes the push, for which the key is timing. The result should be almost a back dive. The most efficient swimmers follow an arc and their feet go from under the water to out of the water and then back through the same hole that the upper body goes through. Strong swimmers get the entire body out of the water at some point and basically go through the same hole as the hands. Depth on the entry differs from that of the chest-down strokes. In the backstroke, the streamline and the dolphin kick are important elements. In fact, one of the fastest recorded backstroke swims was done mostly on an underwater streamline with a dolphin kick. With this in mind, if you are a good dolphin kicker, it works to your advantage to go deeper and longer on the entry. In competition, your streamline is allowed to extend for a maximum of 15 yards. Experiment to find out which head and body positions produce the best streamline for you while keeping you underwa- ter for the correct amount of streamline.

Keep your hands in front, let your feet leave the bottom, and push your chest forward. This approach allows you to cover more horizontal dis- tance with less energy than walking. 3. Pull one knee up, find the bottom with that foot again, and repeat the upper-body motion as you draw your other leg past the first leg. 4. Repeat as often as neces- b sary to reach a swimming depth. The preceding skill is practiced in a zero-entry pool, but it can also be used at an open-water venue, as shown in the photos. The zero-entry pool is safer, and many skills can be practiced there first prior to open-water trials.

from a beach or other shore with a shallow and long run out to deeper water. To do the drill, get clear knowledge of the bottom terrain, then wade into ankle-deep water. Continue wading out until the water is at least waist deep, then lean in, almost as if doing the butterfly stroke; be sure that your hands are in front of you before you push off of the bottom. Come up, stand, and repeat as necessary until you are in water of good swimming depth. To do this drill in a pool, find a zero-entry pool or practice by diving over a lane line or noodle in shallow water. If you are in a zero-entry pool, be sure that it has sufficient depth for performing the drill safely. Keep your hands in front of your head when dolphining into the water so that any change in depth is felt by your hands— not your head. You can also dive under a lane line or noodle as if it were a wave coming in to the shore; swimming over such waves is a waste of energy, so it is better to simply duck under them. tO inCreaSe diFFiCulty • Push with one foot while maintaining forward movement with your other leg, as if you were striding on land. tO deCreaSe diFFiCulty • Stop after each dolphin.

Moreover, much of the world’s open water provides you with only a few feet of visibility (if that), which limits the value of lifting your head for vision, especially since doing so can compromise your body position. In addition, without the benefit of a pool marking, most swimmers tend to pull to one side or the other, thus com- pounding the problem of navigation and encouraging you to look up more often than you need to. 191 --- Page 211 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Combine these factors with challenging wind, waves, or currents and you can end up all over the place. To make matters worse, the buoys that mark open-water courses are often are hard to see. In many cases, therefore, it is better to find a more prominent landmark on an opposite shore or some other stationary object to assure you that you are swimming straight (figure 9.4). Here are a few skills and drills to help you ensure that you swim in the right direction. Figure 9.4 In open-water swimming, it’s best to use a prominent landmark when sighting and navigating.

Survival SWimming Sidestroke, though not a competitive stroke, is a great stroke to master for open-water and survival swimming. It allows you to have your face out of the water to breathe and uses a powerful scissorlike kick. Like breaststroke, it derives propulsion almost equally from armstroking and kicking. As the name implies, sidestroke is done on the side; one shoulder and arm are toward the bottom of the pool, and the other shoulder is out of the water with the majority of the arm submerged. As with the other strokes discussed in this book, the best way to master the sidestroke is to master its individual elements separately and then put them all together. Sidestroke Kicking The sidestroke employs a scissor kick (figure 9.7), which differs from the flutter kick in that the legs are wide apart and the swimmer is on his or her side. To perform the scis- sor kick, bring the leg that is closer to the surface forward by drawing the knee toward your chest. The leg that is closer to the bottom of the pool extends back so
