After all, we use our bodies from head to toe to perform our sport. The complex system of muscles that weaves together over our frames allows us to do the quick, explosive movements, and the long, repetitious movements that make up swimming. Our muscles work in tandem to make it possible to perform tasks as simple as putting on goggles and as lofty as winning Olympic gold. Yet, when we see a fantastic swimmer moving through the water with grace and speed, we don’t associate their speed with muscular strength. Instead we associate it

by swimmers, we see that, without a doubt, competitive swimming provides some of the best cardiovascular fitness of any sport. The full body requirements and repetitive nature of our sport promotes high levels of aerobic capacity and cardiovascular efficiency, much like runners and cyclists possess, but with the added requirement of propelling ourselves through a medium thicker than air. Swimming also requires mastery of breathing timing (more so than any other sport). Whereas on land, athletes have no restrictions on breathing, in swimming getting new air is limited to the time when the face is out of the water, ultimately boosting fitness even further. 13 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 13 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 16 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Swimmers are also very flexible, and in many cases, almost too flexible. The loose joints (especially in the shoulders) that enable a swimmer to reach and stroke effectively, and move so fluidly can also allow the bones to move around at the joint, causing inflammation and pain. The only area where swimmers often lack enough flexibility is at the ankle, where it is desirable to have the ability to easily point the toes and create a straight line to the knee. Still, among land athletes, only ballet dancers have better ankle flexibility than swimmers. Swimmers are very coordinated, as well. The complex nature of swimming uses every part of the body to move forward in a series of movements within each stroke cycle, encouraging an intuitive understanding of the kinetic chain. And, in what other sport does the athlete propel himself or herself at full speed toward a wall, then tuck and reverse directions without slowing down? Finally, we come to strength, the final measure of athletic condition. As we compare the strength developed by swimmers with the strength

tension, the effect that is produced is not forward motion as desired but a fishtailing or bobbing movement. Muscles are often categorized as movers and stabilizers. While some muscles serve exclusively as stabilizers, many muscles actually perform both functions. It is the larger surface layer muscles of the core and limbs that can act both as both movers and stabilizers as the body goes through the series of stroke actions that make up swimming. There are several examples of this dual function in swimming. THE TRAPEzIUS The trapezius muscle is the large muscle of the upper back that connects the neck and the shoulders and the back. The trapezius moves and rotates the shoulders and neck, as well as stabilizes the shoulder blades and upper body. In freestyle, the trapezius is engaged as a primary mover during breathing as the head turns for the inhale, and during recovery, as the arm moves back to the beginning of the stroke. It also serves as a stabilizer assisting the swimmer in maintaining 35 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 35 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 38 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming a positive floating position throughout the entire stroke action. When a swimmer presses his or her chest down to achieve the “downhill” floating position, the shoulder blades move closer together. The trapezius is employed in achieving and holding this position. THE OBLIQUES The obliques are bilateral abdominal muscles located at either side of the “six pack.” The function of the obliques is to assist in rotation and sideways stabilization of the body. In freestyle and backstroke, the obliques act in partnership, one as a mover and one as a stabilizer, to produce the pendulum- like roll that provides leverage to the arm stroke. As the swimmer rolls into the stroke, the oblique muscle

The relatively smaller muscles of the limbs may ultimately apply the resistance, but the larger muscles of the core are able to produce more force and power, allowing a faster tempo to be created and sustained. The muscles of the core, both in the front and the back of the body, are also our primary stabilizers. As the connectors between the upper and lower limbs, the tension held in these muscles is central to producing efficient and coordinated stroke action. Without core tension, we would not be able to achieve a unified stroke, produce leverage, or maintain balance and alignment throughout the changing positions of the stroke. 38 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 38 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 41 Text --- The Swimming Muscles TAKE A SWIMMING LESSON FROM A SEAL Part of the Pinniped order (from the Latin meaning “wing foot”), we have to look in awe at seals, who are not only among the fastest aquatic mammals but are also the most efficient swimmers. Moving through the water at speeds up to 25 miles per hour (about the same speed as dolphins and whales), seals are at the top of the list in terms of least energy cost associated with producing speed. It seems that seals have perfected swimming. Like humans, seals are air-breathing mammals, and like us, they have four limbs. However, over millions of years, these descendents of bears have adapted to using aquatic locomotion so well that we should stop and pay attention. Watching the seal swimming at high speed, we see that it holds its front limbs flat against the sides of its body and uses a narrow, undulating motion that starts at the head and moves down through its body. This wave action is based on movement and stabilization of the seal’s spine by the

major and the deltoids, among others. However, when one part of our body is out of alignment, the mirror image muscles are very adept at taking over the work. Repeated exercise with poor posture can result in bilateral muscles developing unevenly as one side compensates for the other. As swimming depends on bilateral strength, maintaining good posture is very important. 104 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 104 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 107 Text --- The Fundamentals Good posture starts with the awareness of your body position and stance. One of the most positive steps you can take is to develop core strength that stabilizes posture from the front and the back. This will help keep shoulders, hips and knees in alignment, encouraging strength to be developed in a more balanced manner. BREATHING Breathing function is an essential part of athletic performance. Posture plays an important part in good breathing function. Bad posture encumbers breathing capacity by allowing the trunk of the body to be compressed, leaving less room for the lungs to expand and contract. One of the quickest and best ways to improve your breathing during exercise is to stand up straight. Breathing rhythm is very important. Just as we use rhythmic breathing in the pool, it should also be used during strength training. Avoid holding the breath during exertion. Instead, just like swimming, and most all other sports, exhale during exertion and inhale during recovery. Exchanging air properly will keep your muscles better supplied with the oxygen they need to perform. It will also keep you from fatiguing as quickly. CONTROL It is important to control every movement against resistance, both in the power phase and recovery. Always maintain balance and stability during the power phase. Always return to the starting position gently and with less speed. Never allow an

Not top-level racers striving for national championships or dreaming of Olympic glory. Ordinary swimmers. The ones who fall somewhere between Becky Adlington and people who would only swim if they fell out of a boat. In other words, most of us. IS THIS BOOK FOR YOU? There are lots of good books on swimming out there. To work out if this particular one will help you, ask yourself if you fit into one of these categories: • Are you a keen swimmer who turns up at the pool and regularly swims for half an hour or more, getting fitter and fitter – but never much faster? • Does it feel as though you’re splashing your way up and down the pool, while you notice the really good swimmers smoothly gliding along? • Would you like to be able to do triathlons, but find the swim leg so daunting that it puts you off? • Do you find swimming front crawl so tiring that you can only manage a couple of lengths at a time – even though you can swim breaststroke for ages? • Are you aiming to take part

triathlons, but find the swim leg so daunting that it puts you off? • Do you find swimming front crawl so tiring that you can only manage a couple of lengths at a time – even though you can swim breaststroke for ages? • Are you aiming to take part in a long swim for charity and feeling nervous about completing the distance, or maybe wishing you could swim front crawl instead of breaststroke? If you read one or more of these and felt a flash of recognition, Swim Better, Swim Faster can help. SIX SIMPLE ELEMENTS Swim Better, Swim Faster separates front crawl into six key elements. Work on just one of these for even a few hours, and you should feel an improvement in your stroke: --- Page 7 Text --- 1. Flexibility 2. Body position 3. Arm stroke 4. Breathing 5. Kicking 6. Stroke and rhythm People often feel that they have a particular problem with one of these areas, and concentrate on that. But the trick with swimming is to get all the elements of your stroke working together smoothly and in balance. Work on all six over a period of time, and your swimming will quickly improve. TURNS As well as swimming technique, Swim Better, Swim Faster has advice on turns: • Many pool swimmers would like to learn tumble turns, which are a great way of getting more out of your time in the pool. • Triathletes taking part in cold-weather races often do the swim leg in a pool. In some triathlons swimmers are banned from doing tumble turns – but it’s still possible to make up a lot of time by doing the fastest possible touch turn.

has a much neater swimming technique: most of the movement comes from her hips, not her knees, and she is kicking mostly underwater with only her heels breaking the surface. --- Page 10 Text --- SWIMMING IS SIMPLE swim verb float, glide, slip, stroke, submerge, move or propel yourself through water using natural means such as arms and legs At heart, swimming is simple. The basic techniques – arm pull and recovery, kick, and body movement – aren’t especially complicated. But unless you’ve been a competitive swimmer, you probably don’t really have a clear idea of what you should be trying to achieve. This chapter gives you that information. WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR Aim for a smooth stroke, your body rolling from side to side with each arm stroke, but always straight and level in the water. Breathing should be a seamless --- OCR from Page 10 Image 1 --- ea . * gent ye 2 nee --- Page 11 Text --- part of the side-to-side roll that comes with each arm stroke. Your legs kick in a rhythm that matches your arms. FRONT CRAWL ARM PULL Each front crawl arm pull should be a smooth arm movement. However, when thinking about your technique it’s useful to divide each arm stroke into four stages: 1. Entry 2. Catch 3. Pull 4. Recovery The underwater part of each stroke begins slow and gets faster. Your hand accelerates, moving faster as you reach the end of the pull. Stage 1: Entry Your arm enters the water fingertips first, with the thumb side angled slightly downward. It goes in level with your shoulder (rather than your nose). Your hand then stretches forward, still off centre, and turns so that it’s flat to the bottom of the pool. Stage 2: Catch Your arm begins

arm enters the water fingertips first, with the thumb side angled slightly downward. It goes in level with your shoulder (rather than your nose). Your hand then stretches forward, still off centre, and turns so that it’s flat to the bottom of the pool. Stage 2: Catch Your arm begins to bend and your hand sweeps downward, with your elbow bent and staying high. At this point your body has rolled, so that the pulling side is slightly down and the other side slightly up. This stage of your stroke feels like a powered glide, maintaining your speed but not increasing it. Stage 3: Pull The pull is the stage that adds speed. Most swimmers pull in a slightly curved path. Their hand sweeps in from the line of their shoulder to just inside the outer line of their body, then out again to leave the water with their thumb brushing their hip or thigh. Other swimmers find that a feeling of pulling straight back works best (though the roll of their body means they don’t actually pull straight backward). --- Page 12 Text --- Stage 4: Recovery Your elbow leaves the water before your hand, and leads the recovery. Leading with your hand rather than your elbow is a common mistake. It often causes the body to twist and kink, rather than keeping in a straight line. It’s important to relax your arm during the recovery, as this helps you swim smoothly. BREATHING --- Page 13 Text --- Breathing is one of the things lots of untrained swimmers have trouble with. Often it’s because they’re turning their head to breathe by twisting their neck around, lifting their chin, or both. This makes your stroke lumpy and uneven, and tends to lead to snaking along the pool when you should

some elements of swimming technique you’ll never be able to manage. People with stiff neck, shoulders and back find it particularly hard to master technique, but overall flexibility is important in swimming. STRETCHING TECHNIQUES Never do any stretch to a point where it hurts. You need to be able to feel a bit of --- Page 20 Text --- pull in the muscles you’re stretching, but if it starts to hurt, gently ease out of the stretch and try again. It’s best to time your movement into the stretch to happen as you breathe out. If you need to take a breath, stop moving while you breathe in. Use your breath When you’ve taken a stretch as far as is comfortable, concentrate on breathing deeply, from your stomach rather than your chest. It helps you relax and get a little more from the stretch. INCREASING FLEXIBILITY To improve their swimming, most people also need to improve their general flexibility. A great way to do this is to take a yoga course. There are lots of different schools of yoga: a gentle one may be best. Scaravelli yoga seems to be useful for swimming, but it’s not that common, and it can be hard to find courses. Hatha yoga is a good alternative. The exercises on the following pages are mainly targeted at swimming (apart from the sun salute for general flexibility). You can do them just about anywhere: sitting in front of the TV, on the poolside, out in the garden. Try to do some flexibility work every day – 15 minutes spent on this pays dividends in the pool. WARMING UP AND WARMING DOWN As well as using stretches to improve your flexibility, make them part of every swimming session. Spend 10 minutes at the start and finish of

the ground. Place your left forearm outside your right knee then gently move your right knee outward. Hold for five deep breaths, then repeat on the other side. Hip stretch 1. Hip stretch 2 From a standing position, take a lunge step forward. Kneel on your rear knee: this knee needs to be behind your hip. Cup your hands over your front knee, then move your hips forward until you feel the stretch in your hip and upper thigh. Your front knee should be at an angle of at least 90°. Hold the stretch for several deep, long breaths, then repeat with the other leg. --- Page 30 Text --- Hip stretch 2. Side stretch This simple stretch is great is you’re having trouble extending forward after your hand enters the water. Concentrate on breathing deeply and relaxing into the stretch. Stand in the starting position for the sun salute. Make sure your hips are tucked in and relaxed, and your feet shoulder-width apart (this is closer together than most people think – use a mirror or the reflection in a window to check, if you can). Bring your arms above your head, and hold your left wrist with your right hand. Lean to the right: take care to keep your body facing forward, don’t let yourself turn your shoulders or hips in the direction of the stretch. When you feel a stretch down your side, hold the position for several deep breaths, then return to the starting point. Repeat for the other side. --- Page 32 Text --- SHOULDERS AND NECK These two stretches help with your shoulder mobility, which is crucial for swimming front crawl. Doing them regularly makes stretching forward after your arm has entered the water much easier. This starts your body rolling and puts it

but your torso spins around the imaginary straight line running from your head to your feet. There are three big advantages to rolling your body with each stroke. First, you’re more streamlined and slip through the water using less energy. Second, the roll helps your leading hand extend further forward at the front of your stroke, adding to your pull. Third, it makes a smooth breathing action easier to achieve. Swimmer rolled to the side, breathing. Swimmer rolled to the same side, not breathing. Notice how the amount of body roll is similar in both photos See for yourself: Body roll and reach It’s easy to show how rolling your body extends the reach of your stroke: • Stand square to a table, about a metre away, and bend forward so that your --- Page 54 Text --- torso’s parallel to the ground • Reach toward the table with one arm, as you would at the front of your freestyle stroke, but keeping your shoulders square • Now turn your shoulders, so that the one reaching out drops and the other one rises See how much dropping your shoulder adds to your reach? These drills will help you develop good body roll as part of your stroke. In the second drill, the body roll is linked to taking a breath. This helps develop good, smooth breathing technique. Don’t forget, though – you roll with every stroke, not only the ones when you take a breath. Body roll drill 1 This drill allows you to get a feel for swimming in a streamlined position on your side. What you need • Pool with a line along the bottom (always try to swim straight along the line) • Swim fins 1. Push off, and take one arm pull with your right arm.

Push off, and take one arm pull with your right arm. After taking the pull, --- Page 55 Text --- lay your right arm along your side. 2. Stretch your left arm out in front, dropping your shoulder. Your head will turn to the side – just let it turn with your body, don’t twist your neck – and your right shoulder, arm and hip will lift out of the water, so you’re swimming along on your side. 3. Swim like this for a steady count of four, turn your head to take a breath, and carry on. Swim a whole length like this, with your right side up; repeat with your left side up on the next length. --- Page 56 Text --- Body roll drill 2 This is a development of drill 1, but it adds a change of sides. Don’t worry overmuch if your breathing needs work (just turn to Chapter 5 for advice) – in this drill, the focus is on getting used to swimming in a streamlined position on both sides. What you need • Pool with a straight line along the bottom • Swim fins 1. Push off along the line and take one stroke with your right arm, as in the previous drill. 2.

Repeat this drill all the way down the length of the pool. --- Page 57 Text --- Top tip As a way of controlling your head angle, USE YOUR VISION Swim looking down at the bottom of the pool. Then, as you turn your head to breathe, aim to have your vision across the line of the water’s surface. You should see the world on its side: if it looks like normal, you have tilted your head up to breathe (like the swimmer above) and compromised your streamlined position. THE ENERGY-SAPPING EVILS OF TWIST ‘Twist’ is when your spine bends from side to side as you swim. Twist in your swimming stroke slows you down. It increases drag, and forces you to use more energy than necessary to move forward. ONE SIDE OR BOTH? Ask a friend to watch you swim, from head-on and from behind. They can tell --- Page 58 Text --- you if your stroke has twist in it, and whether the twist is to one side or both sides. Twist to one side If the twist is only on one side, it is often linked to the swimmer’s breathing technique. They are usually breathing only to one side of their body, which makes it harder to swim with a balanced stroke. The advice in this section will help solve the problem, but if your stroke only twists one way, it would also be a good idea to start breathing bilaterally.

stroke. The advice in this section will help solve the problem, but if your stroke only twists one way, it would also be a good idea to start breathing bilaterally. See for yourself: twist It’s easy to demonstrate to yourself how twist affects your stroke: • Push off the side of the pool keeping your body as straight as you can, and see how far you glide • Push off again, but with your head and feet twisting as far to the same side as possible You’ll soon get the measure of how badly twist can slow you down --- Page 59 Text --- This swimmer’s stroke has twist on both sides of her body. Twist to both sides Twist to both sides has two common causes: trying too hard, and lack of flexibility. Swimmers trying to swim as fast as possible often throw their arms violently forward. This pulls their shoulders round, and causes their hips and legs to crab around in the same direction. Lack of shoulder flexibility can also cause (or make worse) the twist in your stroke. Rather than extending the shoulders to reach forward and begin the arm pull, swimmers lacking shoulder flexibility have to twist their body. Because of this, the advice on the next pages should always be combined with flexibility exercises. --- Page 60 Text --- ELIMINATING TWIST As part of your effort to eliminate twist from your stroke, try to imagine your spine is part of an inflexible steel rod running down your body from head to toe. The rod can roll, but it can’t be bent. If you don’t like this image (and I don’t blame you), try imagining you’re swimming with your body inside a tube and it mustn’t touch the sides.

allows you to practise the whole arm stroke, concentrating on every aspect of it, before you start swimming using your redesigned arm stroke. --- Page 85 Text --- High-elbow drills Try these drills without swim fins, but if you find your hips are dragging put some on to keep your body position streamlined. What you need • Possibly swim fins 1. Push off into a streamlined position. Instead of swimming alternate right- arm left-arm pull with one arm only. Make sure your focus stays strongly on keeping your elbow high for the catch, and don’t allow your hand to pull in under your body. 2. Allow your body to roll down into the stroke as usual, but make sure you return to a flat, streamlined position after each arm stroke. 3. Having swum a few lengths of this, first on one arm, then the other, try the same action but with alternate strokes. This variation works best with fins: return to a streamlined position after each arm stroke, kick three or five times, then take an arm stroke on the opposite side. Don’t forget to keep your head position looking down at the bottom of the pool. --- OCR from Page 85 Image 1 --- ; | - i --- Page 87 Text --- In this sequence, you can see clearly how the swimmer’s body rolls to the side with each arm stroke, whether he is breathing or not.

The root cause is usually problems elsewhere in their stroke: if you get your body position, arm stroke and leg kick right, breathing fits naturally into the rhythm of your swimming. Even so, it’s important to stay aware not only of how you breathe, but also why. WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR --- Page 90 Text --- The key to breathing technique in freestyle is that it should be part of the general movement of your stroke. Unless you manage this, every time you take a breath it throws your whole technique out of balance, which causes drag and slows you down. • Aim for a smooth turn of the head; really no more than a slight addition to the roll of your body as you take a stroke. • Keep your neck at the same angle as usual: you’re aiming to turn your head to the side slightly, not to lift it from the water.

smooth turn of the head; really no more than a slight addition to the roll of your body as you take a stroke. • Keep your neck at the same angle as usual: you’re aiming to turn your head to the side slightly, not to lift it from the water. • Make sure you have breathed out underwater before lifting your mouth clear of the surface. This gives you the opportunity to take on the maximum possible amount of oxygen. Taking a breath --- Page 91 Text --- The same body and head angle, but no breath being taken Top tip One of the mistakes people make most often is lifting their face too far out of the water when they breathe. Remember: ALWAYS LEAVE ONE GOGGLE IN THE WATER If both goggles come out of the water when you turn to breathe, you’ve turned your head too far or are holding it at too high an angle. --- Page 92 Text --- BREATHING IS IMPORTANT! It’s worth recapping why we breathe while swimming. Taking oxygen on board is what allows your muscles to keep working over time. Without it, they quickly build up lactic acid, which causes a burning sensation and forces you to stop within a couple of minutes. The only swimmers who sometimes don’t breathe are 50m sprinters, whose event is over so fast that they don’t have time to build up lactic acid. Anyone swimming further has to take on oxygen. For events such as triathlon, it’s extremely important that lactic acid doesn’t build up during the swim leg and affect you later in the race. Breathing correctly is therefore key. BREATHE IN, BREATHE OUT Of course, there are two elements to breathing: taking in oxygen, and expelling waste gases. • Take all in-breaths smoothly: don’t

BREATHE IN, BREATHE OUT Of course, there are two elements to breathing: taking in oxygen, and expelling waste gases. • Take all in-breaths smoothly: don’t gasp or snatch at your breath, just take a smooth, deep lungful of air. • Breathe out when your face is underwater, a steady release of bubbles that --- Page 93 Text --- starts as soon as your face goes underwater. That way when you have a chance to take oxygen on board, you get the maximum possible amount. BREATHING PATTERNS Your breathing pattern is the number of strokes you do before taking a breath. Most people find it easier to breathe on one side than the other, and end up breathing every two strokes. Overall it’s better to breathe every three strokes, but there are advantages to each pattern. Breathing every two strokes. Advantage: You get more breaths per length, making it easier to swim longer distances without building up lactic acid in your muscles. Disadvantage: It’s easy for your stroke to become lopsided and unbalanced. Breathing every three strokes Advantage: Your stroke has to be balanced and flexible, because you have to learn to roll your body both left and right. Disadvantage: You can’t take in as much oxygen, so sustaining this breathing pattern takes a greater degree of aerobic fitness and training. The acid test is probably whether you just get too tired when using a three-stroke breathing pattern. If so, it may be best to use a two-stroke pattern until your fitness reaches the necessary level. Even then it’s a good idea to change the side on which you breathe every length or so, so that

whether you just get too tired when using a three-stroke breathing pattern. If so, it may be best to use a two-stroke pattern until your fitness reaches the necessary level. Even then it’s a good idea to change the side on which you breathe every length or so, so that you learn to breathe properly on both sides of your body. HEAD POSITION As well as affecting your body position, your head position has an important role to play in your breathing. Too high or low will not only cause drag but also make breathing awkward. The ideal head position comes from your neck being in line with your spine, when viewed from the side. Look very slightly ahead, but at the bottom of the pool rather than directly forwards. --- Page 94 Text --- See for yourself: head position Well, not quite for yourself: you need a friend to assess your head position. Ask your friend to pay attention to the shape of the water pushed up by your head as you swim toward them: • If the water hits your forehead or hairline, and there’s always a bow wave lifting up at the front and curving around the side of your head, your head position is too high. You need to drop your chin a bit. • If only the back of your head is visible, and the water level never comes lower than your hairline, your head position is probably about right. • If your head never comes out of the water at all, your head may be too low, and you need to look a little more ahead. --- Page 95 Text --- Kick–breathe drill This is a really simple drill, which helps you get used to the small movement you should be making to take

comes out of the water at all, your head may be too low, and you need to look a little more ahead. --- Page 95 Text --- Kick–breathe drill This is a really simple drill, which helps you get used to the small movement you should be making to take a breath. What you need • Swim fins 1. Push off and begin to kick in a streamlined position, with both arms in front of you. Take one arm stroke, but without the recovery. Instead, leave your hand straight back, next to your hip. 2. Reach forward with your leading arm, dropping the shoulder and rolling to add length. As you do this, the shoulder of your trailing arm will lift up, leaving you swimming on your side. Your head will be mostly underwater, and your neck in line with your spine. 3. To breathe, simply turn your head sideways, then lower it again. Make sure you rotate your head – don’t lift it. 4. Give a few more kicks, and repeat the breath. Do a whole length breathing on this same side, then change sides for the following length. Rolling breath drill This drill’s key aim is to establish the timing of when to take a breath. You --- Page 96 Text --- also develop a sensation of what it’s like to breathe on both sides of your body (if you don’t already do so). Finally, the drill helps you to swim with a balanced stroke, returning to a streamlined position after each breath. What you need • Swim fins 1. Put on fins. Push off into a streamlined position, and take an arm stroke without the recovery, as in the previous drill. Reach forward and let your body turn into the breathing position described in step 2 of

streamlined position after each breath. What you need • Swim fins 1. Put on fins. Push off into a streamlined position, and take an arm stroke without the recovery, as in the previous drill. Reach forward and let your body turn into the breathing position described in step 2 of the previous drill. 2. Take a breath, and keep swimming on your side for a count of three. You’ll find that a fast leg kick makes this drill easier to complete. 3. At the count of three, take an arm pull with your extended arm and recover with your trailing arm. Coordinate the two movements. As you roll to the other side during the arm stroke, leave the pulling arm trailing and the recovery arm extended, so that you’re in the breathing position again, but facing the other side. 4. Take a breath, swim on your side for a count of three, and continue down the length of the pool in the same way. Try to keep your movements smooth – it’s tempting to snatch at the arm pull. You’ll find that a strong leg kick helps, as it allows you to concentrate on the motion of your upper body. Extra focus points Some swimmers find the rolling breath drill tricky at first. It’s worth persevering, because this drill is a great way to build up a nice, even side-to- side roll in your stroke. Once you have mastered the basic drill, bring in extra focus points: 1. Make sure that while you’re swimming on your side your ear is cushioned on your shoulder. This should bring your vision perpendicular to the line of the water’s surface. 2. When you take a pull and change sides, keep your vision (and head) at this --- Page 97 Text --- angle. So,

that while you’re swimming on your side your ear is cushioned on your shoulder. This should bring your vision perpendicular to the line of the water’s surface. 2. When you take a pull and change sides, keep your vision (and head) at this --- Page 97 Text --- angle. So, your line of vision should traverse smoothly from an on-its-side view of the edge of the pool, through looking straight down at the bottom of the pool, to an on-its-side view of the opposite wall. Two-pull drill This drill adds a new element to the previous one. Now you’ll be combining a breathing stroke with a non-breathing stroke. Initially, you swim breathing every two strokes, alternating sides after each length. The progression version introduces breathing on both sides during the same length. --- Page 98 Text --- What you need --- Page 99 Text --- • Swim fins 1. Put on your fins, and push off into a streamlined position. Use a powerful leg kick: this drill works best if you’re getting consistent drive from your legs. 2. Take a stroke with your left arm, but without the recovery. Leave your left arm trailing at your hip, and reach forward with your right arm. Your left shoulder will lift so that you’re swimming partially on your side. 3. Swim like this for a couple of beats, until you feel settled in that position, then take a stroke with your right arm and recover your left arm. Notice the timing of when your recovery begins versus when your arm pull begins. As you do this, roll to the right, so that now your right shoulder is up and you’re looking to the right side. 4. Smoothly turn your head to take a long, smooth breath, then let it sink back into

when your recovery begins versus when your arm pull begins. As you do this, roll to the right, so that now your right shoulder is up and you’re looking to the right side. 4. Smoothly turn your head to take a long, smooth breath, then let it sink back into the water. Again, keep the position until you settle, then take an arm stroke with your left arm, returning to the position in 2. Don’t take a breath: just settle, and repeat the sequence all the way down the length. Progression version This drill is done with more pace. You still need a strong leg kick, but the stroke rate (the speed at which your arms move) is also higher. 1. Push off into a streamlined position, using a strong leg kick. Take an arm stroke without the recovery, rolling your body to the side but not taking a breath. Hold this position for a count of 2. 2. Take an arm pull with your leading arm and recover your trailing arm, rolling your body so that you’re facing the other side. Don’t forget to blow out a steady trail of air underwater. Hold this position for a count of two. 3. Take a third arm pull, rolling back to the side you started on, returning to the position you were in at the end of step 1. This time, take a breath as in the previous drill. --- Page 100 Text --- 4. Repeat this breath-every-three strokes pattern, with a count of two on each side, all the way down the pool.

It’s hard work at first, and you’ll probably need to increase your capacity for aerobic swimming. This exercise is really more a way of achieving this than a technique drill, but it will help you to maintain a three-stroke breathing pattern. What you need • Fins are useful at first: discard them as you get more comfortable with the drill 1. Swim in three-length units. Give yourself a rest of 10 seconds between each length. Swim the first length breathing every three strokes, the second breathing every five strokes, and the third every seven strokes. You don’t need to be going full tilt, but don’t dawdle along either: this is meant to be a lung buster. 2. Give yourself a 30-second rest, then repeat. 3. Over a period of weeks and months, make things harder, aiming to increase the difficulty whenever you feel you’ve got this one nailed. First, lose the fins. Next, drop the rest between lengths. Then swim in six-length units (3– 5–7, 3–5–7) without a rest between them. --- Page 103 Text --- Keys to success • Time your breath to fit in with the roll of your body • Remember to keep a streamlined head position • Turn your head to breathe – don’t lift it --- Page 104 Text --- • Only turn as far as you need for a breath – keep one goggle in the water at all times --- Page 105 Text ---

Page 107 Text --- The turbulence of a two-beat kick The turbulence of a four-beat kick The turbulence of a six-beat kick KICK TRAINING PRINCIPLES There are a few principles that are worth sticking to when doing technique training for the flutter kick. 1 Try not to swim head-up Even in most swimming clubs you’ll see swimmers doing freestyle kick training with their arms resting on a float and their head sticking up in the air. You don’t swim freestyle with your head up in the air – if possible, don’t train your body to kick in this unnatural position. Of course, swimming with your face in the water does make breathing tricky. The best way round the problem is to use a special swimming snorkel, which instead of going to the side of your head rises in front of your nose and forehead. --- Page 108 Text --- With a swimming snorkel you can concentrate on keeping a nice, flat body position, rather than lifting your head to breathe every few seconds. Using a swimming snorkel in public does require a certain degree of self-confidence, as it makes you look like an extra from a sci-fi movie. There are significant benefits though. 2 Use fins sparingly Swim fins are a good training aid: they are useful in supporting your body during arm drills, and in fitness work they load your legs and build strength. Unfortunately, fins are also the crack cocaine of the swimming world: highly addictive. Nothing beats the feeling of bombing down the pool like a turbocharged human/seal hybrid. Watch out you don’t get hooked. Overusing fins gives your body a false idea of what can be expected from your legs. Then, once you take them off, your technique falls apart. --- Page 109 Text --- Fins

drill steady, and if your back or neck (or both) feel painful or uncomfortable, ease yourself back to a lying-down position and stop. What you need • A yoga mat or similar cushioning 1. Lie flat on your back with your arms by your sides. Bend forward, and with a slight rocking-back motion get your hips in the air, supported on your hands. Your elbows should be below your hips, resting on the floor. Your legs will be in the air, knees bent. Your weight rests on your hips and shoulders. --- Page 118 Text --- 2. Straighten your legs so that they point up in the air. Gently lower your right leg forward and your left leg slightly backward. The two movements should balance each other out, allowing you to stay comfortably upright. 3. Bring both legs back to vertical, then perform the same movement in reverse. Take care to move slowly, to keep your hips solidly planted on your hands, and not to extend your legs too far and topple over. Repeat the movement five times on each side, alternating sides, then gently let yourself roll back to a sitting position. --- Page 119 Text --- Keys to success • Use small flutter kicks, not big splashy ones • Kick from the hips, not the knees • Kick without breaking the surface of the water with your toes • Keep your ankles loose and relaxed --- Page 120 Text --- STROKE AND RHYTHM rhythm noun pace, tempo, cadence, pulse, a regularly recurring pattern of activity, or repeated functions of the body In this last key section, the focus is on fitting everything together: combining good body position, arm stroke, breathing and leg kick into a smooth, easy, efficient style.

If your stroke feels lurching, as though there are kinks or dead spots slowing you down, try to analyse where these are coming from and go back to the relevant sections of this book. To recap the basic elements of a good freestyle swimming technique: • Keep your body straight and flat in the water • Swim with your neck in line with your spine, looking at the bottom of the pool rather than the wall • Put each hand into the water in line with your shoulder, and begin the pull with a high elbow. Avoid pulling in underneath your body • Move arm and hand through the catch, in-sweep and out-sweep phases with increasing speed • Kick your legs in a continuous flutter kick, kicking from the hips without --- Page 122 Text --- consciously bending your knees Head position, breathing At first, most swimmers find this drill something between very tricky and impossible because they’re used to swimming with their head held too high. It does come to you pretty quickly, though, and it’s a really good drill to return to again and again. It reminds you of good head position, body roll and breathing technique. What you need: • A small, not-too-squishy ball, a bit bigger than a tennis ball 1.

too high. It does come to you pretty quickly, though, and it’s a really good drill to return to again and again. It reminds you of good head position, body roll and breathing technique. What you need: • A small, not-too-squishy ball, a bit bigger than a tennis ball 1. Tuck the ball between your chin and your chest. 2. Push off, and start swimming. Try to keep the ball in place, not only as you swim along but also when you breathe. 3. Don’t tense up: remember to keep your jaw and neck relaxed. You’re aiming to hold the ball in place, rather than clamping it tightly down. --- Page 124 Text --- Three-quarter catch-up This simple drill is good for many elements of your stroke. It emphasises the extension and glide of the hand entry and catch phases of your stroke. The drill is also a good way to develop roll and breath timing, and done without fins it plays up the role of your leg kick in maintaining a good body position. This drill can be hard work aerobically when done without fins, so is probably best tackled one length at a time, with a 15-second rest between lengths. What you need • Swimming lane with line along the bottom • Swim fins for some versions 1. If you want to focus on arm technique and timing, put on swim fins.

2. Push off along the line, concentrating on keeping your head and the centre line of your body directly above it. Take an arm stroke, leaving the other arm extended in front of you. 3. Delay the pull of your extended arm until the recovering arm is just about to enter the water. Repeat this stroke and rhythm with the other arm, and carry on all the way down the pool. There are several versions of the catch-up drill. Two of the most useful are full catch-up and reverse catch-up. Full catch-up This is essentially the same drill as three-quarter catch-up, but harder. Instead of starting your arm pull as the recovering arm is about to enter the water, wait until it has slid beneath the surface and is starting to extend. --- Page 126 Text --- Full catch-up Reverse catch-up This drill demands (and so trains you to) a greater level of coordination between body roll and breathing. In reverse catch-up, instead of one arm being stretched out unmoving in front of you, it rests by your side with your hand by your hip. This is basically putting the ‘stop’ in at the other end of your arm pull, before the recovery instead of after. Tarzan-and-Jane This advanced drill is great for checking how well you’re able to keep your body swimming straight, without twisting or kinking. It’s a good one for open- water racers, including triathletes: it helps you get a sense for swimming in a straight line without being able to see where you’re going the whole time. I call this the Tarzan-and-Jane drill, because I started doing it when I was a kid, after seeing Jonny Weissmuller and Maureen O’Sullivan, as Tarzan and Jane, swimming like this in a jungle pool. --- Page 127 Text ---

long, flat, streamlined position. Butterfly drill I include this drill in almost every warm-up. It combines a freestyle arm stroke with a butterfly leg movement. The drill loosens up your torso, gives a really strong feeling for swimming on your side, and a feel for the rotation of your hips and kicking action as you breathe. 1. Push off the wall and take an arm stroke. Keep your other arm extended, and breathe on this first stroke, as you would coming to the surface after a turn. 2. After the recovery, stay rolled to the side and take a second arm stroke with the same arm. Use the forward movement of your arm as it enters the water and the turn of your head after the breath to create a butterfly motion of your body. Let this motion wave down your body, ending in a kick. 3. After two arm strokes on one side, repeat the pattern on the other side, pulling with the other arm, rolling your body in that direction and breathing on a new side. --- Page 133 Text --- SWIMMING BLIND You do need an empty lane to try this! But it’s a really good way to judge how straight and balanced your stroke is. Most of us are constantly making teeny little body adjustments to keep swimming in a straight line. These are based on visual inputs that you don’t consciously register. Take them away, and a truer idea of how balanced your technique is will emerge. I also find swimming blind is a useful way of concentrating on how your stroke feels. It’s amazing how much easier it is to sense the effectiveness of your arm pull, or the degree of water resistance you’re experiencing, with your eyes shut. Start by swimming along above

pool, a smoother, more efficient stroke uses less energy for the same speed. This is probably even more important in open water: events are over longer distances, so the effect of tiny inefficiencies is magnified. One difference from the pool is in stroke rate: open-water swimmers generally swim with a higher arm cadence than pool swimmers, of between 73 and 85 strokes per minute. ADAPTING TO CONDITIONS Open water swimming sometimes – nearly always, in fact – forces you to adapt your technique to the conditions. The key change is that if the water is choppy, a higher recovery of the forearm and hand is needed. This avoids your hand or arm being caught in the chop or wave face. You may also have to adapt your breathing pattern: if waves are coming from the left, breathe to the right, and vice versa. That way you’re less likely to swallow what feels like a small bucketful of water with each stroke. --- Page 157 Text --- Body-rotation mixed drill Good body rotation is as important in open-water swimming as it is in the pool. This mixed drill is hard work when done without fins, so it’s best to start with them on until you’re comfortable with the drill. What you need • Swim fins • Pull buoy 1. Push off in a streamlined position, but with your arms by your sides instead of stretched out ahead. Kick with a steady rhythm. 2. Keep looking downwards, not forwards. Take breaths on alternate sides, simply by rolling your body. Don’t move your arms or turn your neck to breathe, just roll your body. 3. After one length, take off your fins and put your pull buoy between your ankles (not your thighs as usual) or calves. Swim two lengths like this, concentrating

is a particularly bad idea. As a result, endurance swimmers and triathletes rely less on their legs than pool swimmers, except at the start or finish. They mostly use a two-beat kick, and gain less than 5 per cent of their propulsion from their legs. As a comparison, pool swimmers get closer to 10 per cent of their propulsion from their legs. Head position, direction, and sighting The most streamlined head position for freestyle is to be looking straight down, rather than ahead. In the pool, most swimmers are forced to compromise this: they need to avoid crashing into people in front, and to spot the wall for turns. These aren’t problems in open water, so it’s possible to keep a perfect head position most of the time. The only difficulty is that in an open-water swim you need to check where you’re going from time to time. Training to swim in a straight line is a big help, and the next drill (balanced arms) should be useful. But you will still need to ‘sight’ – lift your head to see whether you’re on course for the turn or finish you’re aiming for: 1. Finish breathing out until your leading hand enters the water. 2. Lift your head forward while pressing down (rather than pulling back) with your leading hand. At the same time, kick harder. 3. As your head rises, take a mental photo of the course, and immediately drop it back down into the streamlined position. Don’t take a breath – if your head comes out that high, you’ve lifted it too far. 4. Take an arm stroke, during which your body rolls to the side allowing you to take a breath as usual. --- Page 162 Text --- Balanced-arms drill This exercise is useful for a) finding

OPEN-WATER SWIMS If you get really into open-water swimming, there are some fantastic events around the world that make a great excuse for a trip away. Bosphorus Cross-Continental: follow in the flipper-prints of Lord Byron, in this annual swim down the Bosphorus from Asia to Europe. Damme-Brugge Open Water: a 5km race along a Belgian canal, which was first held in 1910. Hyde Park Christmas Morning Swim: every Christmas Day, a bunch of loonies turns up to swim in the Serpentine, in London. It’s only 90m from one side to the other, but it’s very, very cold. Manhattan Island Marathon Swim: one for the serious distance swimmers, 46km around Manhattan Island in New York.

This is particularly true if you’ve introduced a new element to your stroke – the high-elbow pulling action, for example. If you’ve been swimming in a particular style for years, it will take a long time for a new style to become automatic. Until then, you’ll need to keep reminding yourself at regular intervals. WHEN TO WORK ON TECHNIQUE You’re not likely to achieve much if you only ever work on your technique after a hard training session, when you’re tired. It’s easy to slip into thinking you should be training hard, getting fitter, getting stronger, but none of these will bring you as much benefit as improving your technique. It’s best to devote a whole swim purely to technique work: your body and mind are fresh, and you concentrate harder, getting maximum benefit from your time in the water. Alternatively, if your time in the pool is severely squeezed, you could make technique work part of your warm-up, or spend the first part of the session doing drills, before getting into the fitness part of the session. SPEED VERSUS QUALITY Whenever you’re doing any of the exercises or drills in this book (or any others that you’ve developed for yourself), try to make an active decision not to go fast. There’s an old saying that applies here: ‘First, do it. Then, do it right. Last, do it fast.’ Technique

Set 2 • 4 × 50m, with a 20-second gap between each 50m Move to the progression version of the first drill. Because you’re breathing every three strokes, this may be more tiring: if 20 seconds rest isn’t enough, take longer. Use your vision to assess the angle and movement of your head. Your sight should sweep across the direction in which you’re swimming. Imagine a line perpendicular to your line of travel, crossing it at the point where your eyes look straight down at the bottom of the pool. If your vision follows this line, your head is turning from side to side without lifting.

Tread water in the deep end, then take a deep breath and allow yourself to float vertical in the water. Immediately begin to breathe out in a controlled, steady way. Keep breathing out until you start to sink (it may take longer than you expect). You’re aiming to sink to the bottom and sit there cross-legged. • 8 × 25m, 15-second gap between each 25m Follow the flutter-kick drill. Each time you take a breath and your face goes back in the water, begin to breathe out steadily as in the sinking practice above. Only lift your head when you need to take a breath. --- Page 180 Text --- (Notice how lifting your head to breathe affects the angle and action of your leg kick: your legs sink lower, and you start to bend your knees more, both of which cause drag.)

Ideally, the first set would be done with a swimming snorkel, if you have one and they’re allowed in your local pool. Warm up Swim 400m, broken down into: • 100m front crawl • 200m alternating front crawl and backstroke every 25m • 100m front crawl Set 1 • 8 × 25m, 15-second gap between each 25m Follow the flutter-kick drill. Whether or not you have a swimming snorkel on, remember to keep breathing out a steady stream of air. This stops your upper body from being too buoyant, and helps you to relax your torso and keep it still. Your movement should be from the hips, with stiff knees and loose --- Page 181 Text --- ankles. Set 2 • 4 × (3 × 25m), 20-second gap between each 75m This set is in parcels of three lengths. Swim the first length following the flutter-kick drill but without a swimming snorkel. Hold a pull buoy on top of your kickboard (this is just to get it down to the other end of the pool, so you only have to do it on this first length of the set). For the second length, put your float on the side of the pool and put the pull buoy between your legs, then swim back arms-only (some people like to put the buoy between their calves, rather than their thighs). For the final length, put the pull buoy on the side of the pool and swim full stroke. As you swim the third

per se, we needed a company that understood triathlon swimming and, crucially, how to coach it in a real context. Swim Smooth has built an impressive international reputation and it is exciting that we can now utilise their experience and skills as part of our coaching programme. Swim Smooth will add significant value to our coaching delivery as the demand for coaches in the fast growing modern Olympic sport of triathlon continues to grow year on year. Feedback from the coaches has always mentioned how the Swim Smooth section has improved their swim coaching. New and developing coaches have engaged with Swim Smooth coaching methods and new drills. One of Swim Smooth’s introductory breathing drills – ’breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe’ – is an excellent example of a simple but highly effective drill any coach can use to make an immediate improvement with any level of athlete. Swim Smooth’s methodical step-by-step approach to swim coaching helps remove the clutter which many swimmers report they feel when trying to improve their technique. We look forward to a long and successful partnership with Swim Smooth, and seeing the benefits and added value for our coaches, athletes and the wider sport. —Paul Moss, Coaching Development Manager, British Triathlon —Giles O’Brien, Coach Education Officer, British Triathlon --- Page 9 Text --- Preface The 11-Year-Old Girl You are in the pool one day, enjoying being in the water and working on your freestyle swimming. You are pretty happy with the progress you have been making and swimming is definitely becoming easier and a little quicker too – which is really satisfying. You set off for a few more laps and then suddenly in the next lane over a young girl jumps in the water, probably about 11 years old, and comes flying past you like you are barely moving.

or suggest an idea you have that would help you and other swimmers. We get inspired by hearing your stories so please let us know! Coaching DVDs If you have enjoyed this book then an excellent accompaniment to it would be one of our coaching DVDs, which cover many of the drills and techniques here but in a visual format. In the DVDs we are able to show you great swimmers (including Olympic champions) in action, and visualising their strokes in the water can be hugely beneficial for your own stroke. At the time of writing we have three DVDs to offer you: 1. The Learn To Swim Programme is a fantastic way to learn freestyle from scratch with no prior swimming experience. We build up your stroke technique and confidence one step at a time, helping you adjust to having your face in the water, developing your breathing technique and constructing your stroke piece by piece. You will be amazed at how quickly you develop and you will soon be swimming your first laps of smooth relaxed freestyle – exhilarating! This DVD covers your first strokes in freestyle in much more depth than we have scope to do in this book. 2. Perfect for intermediate swimmers, The DVD Boxset is actually two DVDs and a CD ROM taking you through all aspects of stroke technique; all the drills you need to improve; open water swimming development and techniques, and a full 25- session training plan to follow in the pool.

All these DVDs are available in our store at www.swimsmooth.com/products --- Page 25 Text --- CHAPTER 2 Introduction to Freestyle Swimming The Freestyle swim stroke, often called Front Crawl in many parts of the world, is the fastest of the four competitive strokes and also the one best suited to long distance events. In the elite swimming world it is the only stroke that is raced for distances of 400 m and longer. Freestyle is unique in that the swimmer has their face in the water for most of the stroke before rotating to the side to breathe very low to the surface. Breathing is a significant challenge when learning freestyle and the struggle to get enough air, without taking on water, is a dominant feature of many beginners’ experiences. Freestyle is the fastest of the four competition strokes. The body rotates along the long axis of the spine during the stroke, which helps the swimmer engage their chest, back and core muscles effectively on every stroke. The lack of vertical movement in comparison to butterfly or breaststroke allows good swimmers to sit very high in the water minimising their drag profile. In comparison to backstroke, freestyle has biomechanical advantages, allowing a better propulsive technique in the water. For triathlon and open water swimming, freestyle is a

movement of the swimmer along the long axis of their spine as they swim, a little like being skewered on a kebab stick (as crude as that sounds!). This roll helps the swimmer generate more power, reduces drag and assists the arms in recovering over the surface. Find out how to develop good rotation in Chapter 11. ‘Body Position’ refers to how high a swimmer sits in the water, particularly the level of the hips and legs. A low-lying body position creates lots of drag as the frontal profile is much larger. You can find out more about this area of stroke technique in Chapter 8. ‘Bilateral Breathing’ refers to breathing to both sides when you swim, if not in turn then regularly swapping sides. ‘Unilateral Breathing’ means the swimmer only ever breathes to a preferred side, either the left or right. Swim Smooth strongly recommend the ability to be able to breathe equally well to both sides, for the benefits of doing so see Chapter 7 and Key 3: Open Water Adaptation. ‘The Bow Wave’ is the wave formed by your body as you pass through the water; it’s a term taken from boating where the wave shape is seen against a boat’s bow. The bow wave forms as your head passes through the water with a slight rise in the water’s surface in front of the head followed by a dip past the head and neck area, known as the ‘trough’. A good freestyle breathing technique takes advantage of the bow wave as the --- OCR from Page 28 Image 1 --- freestyle stroke terminology “body position” is the height of the swimmer’s body, hips, legs and feet in the water mn” or “bod I” is the rotation of the at side with every stroke --- Page 29

This is known as ‘Bow-Wave Breathing’. The bow wave is formed by the head and body passing through the water. ‘Feel For The Water’ is a term used to describe the sensation of the water on your hands and arms as you swim. When a swimmer is feeling the water well they are timing their stroke movements to create good propulsion resulting in a good feeling of connection with the water. We use drills and visualisations to help you develop this in your own stroke, see Chapter 13. ‘Stroke Length’ is a commonly discussed area of swimming as we shall see in this book. The normal way to measure it is to count how many strokes you take to swim a length of the pool counting both arms. A lower number indicates a longer stroke. When quoting this figure you should always mention the length of the pool too – e.g. 25 yd, 25 m, 33 m, 50 yd, 50 m. Typical stroke counts in a 25 m pool are between 11 and 30 strokes per length – which you will often see abbreviated to SPL. ‘Stroke Rate’ (not to be confused with stroke length) is how many strokes you take per minute, counting both arms. This is like cadence on a bicycle except with cadence you only count one leg, not both! The higher your stroke rate, the faster you are turning your

swimmers as they push off from the wall. This position has a very low level of drag, lower than when swimming normally. The quickest way to swim is to push off from the wall and hold this streamlined position until the speed drops to normal swimming speed and then ‘break-out’ into full stroke. The length of this push-off is normally around 5 m (15 feet) but some elite swimmers can hold the position up to the maximum FINA-legal limit of 15 m (45 feet) and accompany it with a powerful kick. See Chapters 9 and 10 for a discussion of the other benefits of using a good torpedo push-off when you swim. --- Page 31 Text --- A pace clock has two opposite second hands – with practice you can time yourself over any distance using it. In open water swimmers gain an advantage from swimming behind or to the side of other swimmers, a technique known as ‘drafting’. ‘Short Course’ and ‘Long Course’ pools are technical terms to describe 25 m and 50 m (or yards) pools respectively. The Olympic Games always uses a long course pool and generally they are slightly slower to swim in than a short course pool as the swimmer turns less often and so loses the speed benefit from a strong push-off from the wall. FINA world championships are swum in both long course and short course pools. Two separate sets of world records are kept for long and short course pools. The Wikipedia page at www.swimsmooth.com/worldrecords has a full and up-to-date listing of these complete records and makes for fascinating reading when comparing it to your own times! ‘Hypoxic Breathing’ is the process of swimming whilst limiting your supply of oxygen by breathing less frequently than normal, typically every five, seven or nine

page at www.swimsmooth.com/worldrecords has a full and up-to-date listing of these complete records and makes for fascinating reading when comparing it to your own times! ‘Hypoxic Breathing’ is the process of swimming whilst limiting your supply of oxygen by breathing less frequently than normal, typically every five, seven or nine strokes. Many coaches state that this helps to build lung capacity and aerobic endurance but definitive studies demonstrating this are lacking. At Swim Smooth we use sets of restricted breathing frequency to allow the swimmer to focus on a deeper exhalation in the water rather than holding your breath. When breathing less frequently you should aim to stay calm and to allow yourself time to focus on the symmetry of your stroke. ‘Drafting’ is the act of swimming behind or to the side of another swimmer to gain an advantage. This is perfectly legal in open water swimming and triathlon and viewed --- Page 32 Text --- as fair-play with swimmers looking to maximise the benefit they gain when racing. As we shall see in Chapter 36, there are two positions to draft in, either directly behind or to the side and slightly behind another swimmer. ‘Sighting’ is the act of raising the head above the water’s surface to look forward and navigate in open water whilst swimming. Lifting the head places downward pressure on the legs as the body pivots around its centre and this creates extra drag. As we shall see in Chapter 35, a good sighting technique minimises the head lift to minimise additional drag.

wary of the desire to become stronger by using them – it’s usually the stronger athletes, who need a little more finesse in their stroke, who tend to reach for the big dinner-plate paddles before anyone else in the squad. 9. Finis Snorkel – snorkels are a good way of taking the breathing action out of the freestyle stroke giving you uninterrupted time to focus on other aspects of your stroke like rotation and your catch. Many swimmers find that they feel quite claustrophobic when using a snorkel because they subtly reduce the air flow and make the process more hypoxic than normal swimming. For this reason it is well worth trying one before investing to see how you get on with them. 10. Finis Tech Toc – developing your body rotation can feel like quite an alien concept for those who have swum completely flat for years but the Tech Toc helps you to tune into the rhythm and timing of this essential part of your stroke. The Tech Toc is a hollow cylinder containing a large ball bearing, which sits on your lower back held in place by a waist strap. As you swim it provides an audible click and kinaesthetic sensation as to how well you are rotating. Its name comes from the fact that if you are rotating efficiently you will hear and feel the ball bearing roll to one end of the tube and make a ‘toc’ sound and then with the next stroke it should roll to the other end and make a ‘toc’ sound. If you are not rotating well enough it will remain silent! 11. Swimming watches by Finis, Garmin and Swimovate – great for gadget lovers everywhere!

a little ‘cluttered’ in the past by trying to correct multiple aspects of your stroke at the same time. As we look at each area of freestyle stroke technique in turn we will take a look at the cause of every stroke flaw and provide you with drills and visualisations to remove that underlying cause. OK, let’s get to work! --- Page 48 Text --- CHAPTER 7 Breathing It would not be an overstatement to say that breathing technique is the single most important aspect of freestyle swimming. Good breathing technique is much more challenging in freestyle than the other strokes because the head is in the water at all times and the swimmer must keep their head low and breathe out to the side very near the surface. For swimmers learning freestyle, breathing can be extremely challenging and it’s normal to experience high levels of anxiety about getting enough air and not swallowing water! If you feel this way then developing your exhalation into the water and your bow-wave breathing technique is going to be critical to improving your swimming; these are the first two aspects of breathing technique we’ll look at here. Don’t worry, work on the technique of breathing and you’ll soon be feeling much more calm and relaxed when swimming freestyle. Holding your breath underwater will cause a build-up of CO in your lungs and 2 blood stream and make your swimming feel tense. For intermediate level swimmers, brushing up on bow-wave breathing and exhalation into the water is going to be useful for you and will make a real difference to your efficiency and level of relaxation. We also strongly encourage you to learn to breathe bilaterally, which is important as a natural way of keeping your stroke symmetrical and can even help you develop

the water is going to be useful for you and will make a real difference to your efficiency and level of relaxation. We also strongly encourage you to learn to breathe bilaterally, which is important as a natural way of keeping your stroke symmetrical and can even help you develop the catch phase of your stroke. Don’t worry if you’ve tried bilateral breathing before and struggled, we’ll show you why that was and how to conquer it. Breathing timing, specifically breathing late, can also be a problem for more advanced swimmers. We’ll look at breathing timing in the final part of this section. --- Page 49 Text --- Exhalation For all swimmers it’s important to constantly exhale whenever you are face down in the water. This rids your lungs and bloodstream of CO and means that when you do rotate 2 to breathe you have more time to inhale as you don’t have to exhale first. It also helps to improve your body position as too much buoyancy in the chest lifts your front end up and puts downward pressure on the legs. PAUL: If you’ve ever done any yoga you’ll intuitively understand the relationship between breathing technique and relaxation. If you hold your breath you automatically become tense – please never never do this when swimming! Instead focus on exhaling into the water with a long constant stream of bubbles. I ask swimmers I’m coaching to experiment with making sounds into the water as they exhale, for example the ‘brrrrrr’ sound of a motorboat or motorbike. As simplistic as this sounds it can really make a huge difference to your swimming. Exhaling into the water sounds easy but can be surprisingly hard to learn. For many swimmers it simply doesn’t feel like a natural thing to do. To develop

‘brrrrrr’ sound of a motorboat or motorbike. As simplistic as this sounds it can really make a huge difference to your swimming. Exhaling into the water sounds easy but can be surprisingly hard to learn. For many swimmers it simply doesn’t feel like a natural thing to do. To develop good exhalation technique use the Sink Down Exercise in Appendix A. Experiment between exhaling into the water using either your mouth or nose or a mix of both; there’s no right or wrong here, see which feels more natural for you and then stick with that method. It should feel like you are sighing and not forcing the air out. Try to be loose and floppy as you sink down to remove all the tension from your body. Your ability to sink to the bottom of the pool during the Sink Down Exercise is totally determined by how relaxed and efficient your exhalation is into the water. Many swimmers with poor body positions would expect to sink like a stone but often the opposite is true and they find it harder to sink than other swimmers. This is an interesting insight into their swimming as it shows how their tendency to hold onto their breath is actually harming their body position: the excess buoyancy in the chest lifts their front end up but the body then pivots around its centre and so pushes the legs downward. Once you are able to sink down easily to the bottom of the pool with a nice relaxed exhalation try some easy laps of freestyle swimming. Simply focus on a smooth exhalation into the water using your normal breathing pattern to whichever side you feel most comfortable. For those who normally only breathe to one side, don’t be surprised if you notice that you

with a nice relaxed exhalation try some easy laps of freestyle swimming. Simply focus on a smooth exhalation into the water using your normal breathing pattern to whichever side you feel most comfortable. For those who normally only breathe to one side, don’t be surprised if you notice that you are suddenly able to go from breathing every two strokes to breathing every four strokes and feel more comfortable doing so. Sometimes breathing every two strokes does not physically give you enough time to exhale properly especially if you have a naturally high stroke rate. Develop your relaxation in the water using the Sink Down Exercise at the beginning of your training sessions. --- Page 50 Text --- PAUL: Traditionally swimmers were taught to hold their breath as it increases the level of buoyancy in the chest. This is certainly true but most swimmers already have plenty of buoyancy in the upper body, it is in the legs where it is lacking, especially if you are a triathlete with muscular legs. By smoothly exhaling into the water and removing excess buoyancy in the chest, we can counteract this and get your legs higher in the water. This is a classic example of our philosophy of ‘Cause and Effect’ in swimming. Elite swimmer Jono Van Hazel shows us his excellent exhalation technique through the nose. To really contrast the difference a good exhalation technique makes, trying swimming 100 m straight through as: 25 m exhaling smoothly 25 m holding your breath and exhaling at the last second 25 m exhaling smoothly 25 m holding again ADAM: The key point to remember with exhalation is that as swimmers we are not usually restricted by how much air we can get in but how efficiently we exhale out.

and exhaling at the last second 25 m exhaling smoothly 25 m holding again ADAM: The key point to remember with exhalation is that as swimmers we are not usually restricted by how much air we can get in but how efficiently we exhale out. Clearing the lungs smoothly before taking a deep breath of air on the next inhalation (without gasping) will really help to keep you more relaxed and aerobic in the water. --- OCR from Page 50 Image 2 --- ey eee eS --- Page 51 Text --- You will really notice the contrast, the difference a good exhalation technique can make is truly amazing! THE BUBBLE BUBBLE BREATHE MANTRA Now is an excellent time to experiment with some bilateral breathing if you have not done so already – a better exhalation technique will make things much easier for you to go from breathing every two strokes to breathing every three. As we will see when we look at bilateral breathing in a little more depth later on, it is usually the fear that if breathing every two strokes is challenging already, how could you possibly breathe every three? Try this simple mantra: Take a breath and then on each of the following two strokes say ‘bubble’ into the water. Literally speak it into the water to emphasise the exhalation during each stroke! On the third stroke take a breath to that side whilst saying ‘breathe’ to yourself (not out loud!). Swimming down the lap repeating ‘breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe’ is a great way to coordinate good exhalation with the timing required to breathe every three strokes (bilateral breathing). The chances are you might still feel rather strange breathing to your unfamiliar side but with the tips that follow, we will show you how to improve that too. Using the

is a great way to coordinate good exhalation with the timing required to breathe every three strokes (bilateral breathing). The chances are you might still feel rather strange breathing to your unfamiliar side but with the tips that follow, we will show you how to improve that too. Using the Bow Wave An efficient stroke technique keeps the head low in the water when breathing. Many swimmers feel that they need to lift their heads to find air but lifting the head excessively causes the whole upper torso to lift and the legs to sink, creating a large amount of drag. The secret to keeping your head low in the water is to breathe into the trough of air formed by the bow wave created around your head. Every swimmer has a bow wave, it’s formed as the head pushes forwards through the water creating a small rise in the water in front of the head and then a trough alongside the chin and neck – a channel of air beneath the main surface level of the water. It’s important to appreciate that the bow wave forms off the top of your head and is just deep enough to breathe into by the time it passes the level of your mouth. If you lift your head clear out of the water to breathe then the bow wave will not form off the top of your head and so the trough will not be there for you! This is a very common occurrence for those swimmers who feel they must lift their heads excessively high to keep from swallowing water. Ironically enough, if this instinctive action can be controlled and the head kept lower when breathing, it becomes much easier to get a breath in. Equally though, some swimmers completely bury

common occurrence for those swimmers who feel they must lift their heads excessively high to keep from swallowing water. Ironically enough, if this instinctive action can be controlled and the head kept lower when breathing, it becomes much easier to get a breath in. Equally though, some swimmers completely bury their heads in the water in an effort to improve body position which, as we will see in Chapter 8, might not be necessary for every swimmer. Furthermore, the act of burying the head may be problematic if it is too deep to cause the bow wave to form cleanly. The bow wave forms at the top of your head as it travels through the water; it causes a trough of air beside your mouth to breathe into. --- Page 52 Text --- When developing a good bow-wave breathing technique think about keeping the top of your head low in the water and try and breathe ever so slightly behind you into area (A) shown in Figure 7.4. If you crane your head forwards (B) then the bow wave isn’t as deep, which makes breathing much harder. Many swimmers who spend a lot of time training in the open water often develop position (B) from trying to sight forwards and breathe at the same time, as we will see in Chapter 35 this is something to be avoided. FIGURE 7.4 The ideal breathing angle is (A) where the bow wave is quite deep. If you breathe slightly too far forwards (B) then you will have to crane your head high to reach air. Popeye Breathing: A great way to avoid taking on water when breathing is to angle your mouth to the side like Popeye when he’s chewing his spinach! This lets you keep your head a little lower whilst

(B) then you will have to crane your head high to reach air. Popeye Breathing: A great way to avoid taking on water when breathing is to angle your mouth to the side like Popeye when he’s chewing his spinach! This lets you keep your head a little lower whilst still breathing into the air in the bow-wave trough. --- Page 53 Text --- One simple way to make sure you have this position correct is to ask a friend or coach to walk along the side of the pool with you as you swim. Ask them to walk as close to the water’s edge as possible and ever so slightly behind the level of your eyes. When you go to breathe, you should be able to see their feet walking alongside you. Avoid turning the head too much to see their whole body, seeing the feet is enough. Experiment with making subtle adjustments to the walker’s position relative to you until you find a comfortable breathing point where you are not lifting your head too high or looking too far forward or back. Looking too far back (C) in Figure 7.5 may cause you to bend in the middle and start snaking down the pool or crossing over in front of your head. FIGURE 7.5 Breathing a little too far behind you (position C) can bring your hand across the centre line in front of your head, as we see Serena doing here. --- Page 54 Text --- SPLIT SCREEN VISUALISATION When you are working on keeping your head position low in the water, use fins and aim for a Split Screen View with the lower goggle beneath the water and the upper goggle above.

SCREEN VISUALISATION When you are working on keeping your head position low in the water, use fins and aim for a Split Screen View with the lower goggle beneath the water and the upper goggle above. You should be able to see under and over the water at the same time. This is a useful visualisation to revisit when training or racing and your stroke starts to feel ragged, especially during long distance swims when it can be hard to maintain concentration. Keep one goggle under the water as you breathe and you will see the split screen view. PAUL: Have you ever wondered why elite sprinters breathe so infrequently during a 50 m or 100 m freestyle race? Even at the pointy end of the field a swimmer’s balance and alignment in the water can be thrown off by turning to take a breath, which can make the difference between first and last place in close races. As a result elite sprinters breathe as infrequently as they can. For distances over 100m we need to maintain a much more regular stream of air into the lungs by using a much more frequent breathing pattern: breathing only two or three times per 50 m is not an option over longer distances! With regular breathing we need to maintain a close eye on your stroke while you are taking a breath; it’s easy to switch your focus completely towards getting the air in, and it is then that things go wrong in your stroke technique. As we get into other areas of stroke technique we’ll often be asking you to let the breath take care of itself and maintain an awareness of another part of your stroke. Bilateral Breathing Bilateral breathing is the ability to breathe to the left and the

in your stroke technique. As we get into other areas of stroke technique we’ll often be asking you to let the breath take care of itself and maintain an awareness of another part of your stroke. Bilateral Breathing Bilateral breathing is the ability to breathe to the left and the right, swapping sides regularly as you swim. We are big fans of bilateral breathing at Swim Smooth for a very practical reason: it helps keep your stroke symmetrical. Many swimmers find bilateral breathing hard at first, if you have tried and failed before don’t worry, we will help you crack it! Most people think of bilateral breathing as breathing every three strokes. This is certainly the most common way and the one we’d recommend for you to use as it’s about the right duration between breaths. However, any breathing pattern where you swap sides regularly is bilateral breathing too, for example: Breathing 2-3-2-3: This means breathing twice to one side in a row and then performing three strokes to swap to the other side for two breaths in a row. This breathing pattern is used by many elite swimmers when racing. --- Page 55 Text --- Breathing 5s: Breathing every five strokes can be useful for those with a fast stroke rate who find that breathing every three comes around too often. Swapping sides every lap of the pool: This is often done for tactical reasons to keep a close eye on a competitor in another lane, or simply for something different and engaging. Breathing just to one side is the leading cause of a lopsided stroke, creating issues such as snaking and scissor kicks. If you are a triathlete or open water swimmer then you should be seriously concerned with the symmetry of your stroke. A lopsided stroke is

something different and engaging. Breathing just to one side is the leading cause of a lopsided stroke, creating issues such as snaking and scissor kicks. If you are a triathlete or open water swimmer then you should be seriously concerned with the symmetry of your stroke. A lopsided stroke is never a good thing but in the pool you can minimise the harm done by keeping yourself straight with the guidance of the black line and the lane ropes. However in open water a lop-sided stroke is a serious liability as it will cause you to constantly track off course and swim much further than you have to. What is the most natural way to keep your stroke symmetrical? Bilateral breathing of course! Even if you feel you are slightly slower in the pool breathing bilaterally, you’ll gain back all this time and much more in open water by swimming much straighter. How much of your training should you perform breathing bilaterally? If possible, all of it. Some swimmers struggle with hard sets breathing every three strokes; if that is you then we would still encourage you to perform as much as possible breathing to both sides, even if you only think of bilateral breathing as a drill. As long as the majority of your training is bilateral then your stroke should stay symmetrical. PAUL: Perhaps you’re thinking: ‘this is all very well but I just can’t hold my breath for three strokes!’. But right there lies the problem – you should never hold your breath when you swim! We started this chapter by developing a good exhalation technique and this is the key you need to unlock the door to bilateral breathing. If you hold your breath the CO builds up in your lungs and blood stream, and you

you should never hold your breath when you swim! We started this chapter by developing a good exhalation technique and this is the key you need to unlock the door to bilateral breathing. If you hold your breath the CO builds up in your lungs and blood stream, and you start to feel 2 very desperate for air. You would never hold your breath when cycling or running and you shouldn’t when swimming either. Rid yourself of that CO and bilateral breathing becomes a whole lot more achievable. 2 There are certain situations, when racing in the pool or in the open water, when unilateral breathing would be more beneficial than bilateral breathing, which we will discuss further in Chapter 36. Your ability to breathe equally well to either side will be a tactical trump card in racing situations so that you can draft another swimmer closely or --- Page 56 Text --- keep a close eye on a competitor who might put in a surge at any point. Practicing breathing to both sides in training will give you this ability in races. The Two-Week Bilateral Hump If you are lucky you will take easily to bilateral breathing but most swimmers find it a little strange and awkward at first breathing to their less favoured side. That’s OK, allow yourself about two weeks (or six sessions) to persevere and keep your discipline with it. We call this the ‘two-week bilateral hump’ after which breathing to both sides should start to feel progressively easier every time you swim. The mistake many swimmers make is to try bilateral breathing for a session or two and then give up – keep your discipline a little longer and you can crack it! PAUL: But what about the argument that bilateral breathing makes you less

The mistake many swimmers make is to try bilateral breathing for a session or two and then give up – keep your discipline a little longer and you can crack it! PAUL: But what about the argument that bilateral breathing makes you less aerobic when racing? Any breathing pattern will make you less aerobic when you’re racing if you’re holding your breath under the water; as such good exhalation practice is always essential. The irony is that breathing every two strokes to just one side when racing often doesn’t give you enough time to exhale properly and consequently inhalation becomes shallower and more of a gasp. Whatever breathing pattern you ultimately choose – please always remember to exhale! Always bear in mind that if you find bilateral breathing awkward or uncomfortable there is usually something amiss elsewhere within your stroke, which, if fixed, will not only improve your stroke in its own right but also make bilateral breathing easier. A win-win if you’re prepared to commit to making the change and becoming a better, more versatile swimmer. ADAM: During my eight years as a competitive triathlete I only ever breathed to my right, in fact when swimming a hard set today I still feel a compulsion to breathe just to my right, which I have to resist. Since I joined Swim Smooth in 2008 I’ve made the effort to transition to bilateral breathing – it took me around six swim sessions to feel comfortable doing it and then another few months of swimming before it felt natural. The interesting thing is that if I switch back to breathing to one side now, within just 50 m I start to feel awkward and crabby in my stroke! By 100 m I’m starting to veer

comfortable doing it and then another few months of swimming before it felt natural. The interesting thing is that if I switch back to breathing to one side now, within just 50 m I start to feel awkward and crabby in my stroke! By 100 m I’m starting to veer around in the lane and have to really focus on staying straight. Bilateral Breathing and Overgliding As we’ll see in our Swim Types section (starting at Chapter 17), some swimmers have focused on lengthening out their strokes by adding in an extended pause and glide at the front, something we call ‘Overgliding’. As we will see, this style of stroke is not only inefficient but it also slows down the stroke so much that it becomes very hard to breathe every third stroke – the time between breaths is simply too long. It’s no coincidence then that many Overgliders become very lopsided with their strokes as they are stuck breathing to one side only. In Chapter 21 we will take a close look at Overgliding and show you how to improve the rhythm and timing of your stroke for --- Page 57 Text --- enhanced efficiency. Lifting your stroke rate into the ‘normal’ range will allow you to breathe every third stroke and maintain your symmetry much more effectively. Breathing Timing The timing of breathing is something that is often overlooked by coaches and swimmers. When the swimmer rotates to breathe, the head should rotate with the body at the same time: With good breathing timing, the head slightly leads body rotation. Many swimmers, even some elite swimmers, turn the head a fraction later once the body is already rotated. If breathing to your right for example, the right arm will already be into its recovery phase over the top

same time: With good breathing timing, the head slightly leads body rotation. Many swimmers, even some elite swimmers, turn the head a fraction later once the body is already rotated. If breathing to your right for example, the right arm will already be into its recovery phase over the top of the water before you start breathing. When viewed from the side of the pool this can look like the swimmer will knock their nose with their right shoulder as the arm comes over. Late breathing reduces the time available to inhale and makes breathing feel a little tense and hurried. TURNING YOUR HEAD AWAY FROM YOUR ARM This is a useful visualisation to help you improve your breathing timing. If you are about to breathe to your left then as your right hand passes your head and extends forwards, turn your head smoothly away from that arm. This should be one fluid motion with the head rotating as the hand enters the water. If you breathe late, you’ll still be trying to inhale as the top arm is about to enter the water. --- Page 58 Text --- The top sequence shows classic late breathing with the body rotated (1–2) before breathing high in the air (3). The bottom sequence shows good timing and technique with the head turning away to a low breathing position as the body rotates. It’s common for your breathing timing to be better on one side of your stroke than the other and in fact it is normally your preferred breathing side which has late timing! Although you may feel less comfortable breathing to your un-favoured side you will not have developed any bad habits there and so are likely to have better breathing technique, with better timing and less head lift. --- Page

fact it is normally your preferred breathing side which has late timing! Although you may feel less comfortable breathing to your un-favoured side you will not have developed any bad habits there and so are likely to have better breathing technique, with better timing and less head lift. --- Page 59 Text --- CHAPTER 8 Body Position A high body position in the water is very important for fast, efficient swimming: the legs, hips and feet should all be in one horizontal line near the surface. A swimmer with low-lying legs in the water creates a huge amount of drag, slowing them down dramatically. If you swim more quickly or more easily with a pull buoy between your legs, or are dramatically quicker in a wetsuit, then this is a strong indication that a low body position is a serious issue in your stroke. If you have a low body position in the water then you need to work on improving it as an absolute priority for your swimming: it will be the single biggest thing holding you back. The most common causes of a poor body position are: Holding Your Breath Underwater (Chapter 7). Holding onto your breath creates excess buoyancy in the chest, which lifts you up at the front and sinks your legs. Work on developing a nice smooth exhalation into the water. Michelle has a great body position in the water with chest, hips, legs and feet all in a horizontal line. A High-Lifting Head When Breathing (Chapter 7). In a similar manner to holding your breath, lifting your head high to breathe causes you to pivot at your hips and sink your legs. Developing your bow-wave breathing technique is essential to improving your body position. Looking Too Far Forward in the Water (this chapter). Many

Breathing (Chapter 7). In a similar manner to holding your breath, lifting your head high to breathe causes you to pivot at your hips and sink your legs. Developing your bow-wave breathing technique is essential to improving your body position. Looking Too Far Forward in the Water (this chapter). Many new swimmers with poor natural buoyancy and a feeling of breathing anxiety will swim looking too far forward in the water which in turn can sink the legs at the back. --- OCR from Page 59 Image 1 --- TOR ET ETRE --- Page 60 Text --- Kicking From The Knee (Chapter 9). A poor kicking technique with excess knee bend adds a lot of drag and sinks the legs. Work on moving to a kicking technique with a straighter leg driven from the hip. Scissor Kick (Chapter 9). A scissor kick is normally caused by a crossover of the lead arm in front of the head. This causes a loss of balance and with it an involuntary scissoring of the legs to avoid toppling onto your back. By improving your hand entry and swimming posture (Chapters 10 and 12) you will remove the scissor kick and so improve your body position. Dorsi Flexed Ankles (Chapter 9). Poor ankle flexibility is a problem for many triathletes with a running or cycling background. Such sports create a lot of stability in the ankle, which harms the swimmer’s ability to point their toes. The resultant drag causes the legs to drop down. Under Kicking (Chapter 9). Swimmers who are focusing on making their stroke very long often try a two-beat kick to further reduce effort. For many swimmers with poor natural buoyancy or poor ankle flexibility this does not produce enough lift and their legs sink downward. Poor Core Stabilisation (Chapter 10).

your improved posture helps drive the stroke. ADAM: In the Swim Smooth squads in Perth we perform a lot of these side kicking drills. They really help you maintain your stroke, simultaneously working on your posture, and as we will see later, helping you set up for a good catch too. One quick pointer on 6-1-6: make sure you breathe after the stroke not before. You could think of the drill as: 6-1-breathe-6. Once you’ve tried the side kicking exercises perform some full-stroke swimming using the Middle Finger Visualisation described in Chapter 12. Focus on entering into the water and extending your middle finger gun-barrel straight down the pool in front of --- Page 76 Text --- the same shoulder. If you own a pair of the excellent Finis Freestyler Paddles (see Chapter 3) you can also perform some swimming using them. These have a keel on the bottom of the paddle, which gives you kinaesthetic feedback on how straight you are in the water – crossover and you’ll feel them trying to spin off to that side! As you introduce arm strokes, maintain a focus on your lead arm staying straight and aligned. PAUL: Take the time to carefully read the pointers for these exercises in Appendix A. When you feel like you can perform them quite well, really aim to perfect them with perfect rotation (45° to 60° during the strokes and side kicking at 90°), perfect alignment and a good hand position out in front of you. Stay relaxed and keep exhaling smoothly and continuously into the water. THE 1-2-STRAIGHT MANTRA As you develop your swimming posture you may find that you stay well aligned on normal strokes but on a breathing stroke your crossover returns. This is only natural as during a breathing stroke your focus

Stay relaxed and keep exhaling smoothly and continuously into the water. THE 1-2-STRAIGHT MANTRA As you develop your swimming posture you may find that you stay well aligned on normal strokes but on a breathing stroke your crossover returns. This is only natural as during a breathing stroke your focus tends to shift towards ‘get that air in’! To help you stay straight whilst breathing repeat to yourself ‘1 - 2 - straight - 1 - 2 - straight....’ The 1 and 2 fall on normal strokes and the straight on a breathing stroke, which will help keep your focus on that lead hand during the breath. Other Posture Drills The Broken Arrow Drill described in Appendix A is ideal for swimmers with tight shoulders and upper backs. The drill has a similar timing to 6-1-6 but the recovering arm is taken vertically and paused there for a second. The elbow is then bent to at least 90° before the hand spears into the water. To perfect the drill, as the arm reaches the vertical position consciously relax the shoulder and feel it sink back down into its socket. This will help you loosen off your upper back and shoulder muscles ready for moving back to full-stroke swimming. Lower Core Stability --- OCR from Page 76 Image 1 --- ~~" Cele et weer i ae? oF {.. oo “Pe = ee — walt ores Petes Sayan --- Page 77 Text --- The ‘lower core’ of your hips, lower back and abdominal area is important in swimming to keep you straight in the water and to help rotate your hips and shoulders together as one. Good core control during swimming has a slightly different feel to it compared to other sports, which can cause some confusion. The key to developing your

the fins and swim some laps of freestyle focusing solely on maintaining that sensation of reaching and rolling with each stroke, always being mindful of maintaining good alignment and not crossing over. Focus on stretching forwards with the lead arm as you press the other hand underneath the water towards the hip, with the sensation of needing to rotate this hip out of the way to allow you to finish the stroke off correctly. We’ll revisit this concept of ‘timing the rotation to the arm stroke’ in Chapter 13, which is about how the catch phase affects your rhythm and timing. Rotation and Bilateral Breathing All swimmers rotate a little more on a breathing stroke than a normal stroke. You do this subconsciously to ensure that you get your head in a good position to breathe. Over time this develops a good stroke habit and your rotation becomes good to that side. However, if you only ever breathe to one side (unilateral breathing) then we’ll see your rotation become good to that side but poor to the other. This will give you a lopsided stroke and is one of the major reasons why bilateral breathing is so important for maintaining symmetry in your rotation. The Right Amount of Rotation A great tool to help you monitor your rotation is the Finis Tech Toc. This neat device sits on your lower back, held by a strap around your waist. The Tech Toc has a large ball bearing in it that slides up and down the tube, making a loud ‘click’ when it hits the end. The ball bearing will only slide and hit the end of the tube if you are rotating sufficiently. If you’re struggling to develop your rotation, the Tech Toc is a very worthwhile investment in your swimming.

wrist is important as it will help you initiate the catch itself. If you create too much of a downward angle you will feel your hand pull down towards the bottom of the pool. This is a bit like having your hand out of a car window, changing the angle of your hand in the airflow to pull it up and downward. Experiment with the lead hand in the same way when you are kicking on your side in the pool. --- Page 106 Text --- By aiming to start his catch from very near the surface of the water, Paul C has unwittingly dropped his elbow and from here will have to press down on the water during the initial catch. Spearing forwards a little lower in the position shown will give Paul a much greater use of the effective arc of his catch. Supporting Yourself while Breathing A significant benefit of entering the water and extending forward in this position is that it offers you good support and stability at the front of your stroke. In contrast many swimmers’ lead arms collapse down when breathing, removing any support offered to them. This causes the head to sink and the mouth to drop below the surface, making breathing a real struggle! If you take on water when you swim then introducing a better catch set-up position in your stroke will give you much more support when breathing. Clare’s arm drops down when breathing, giving her very little support. You may find, however, that your arm still wants to drop down as the movement has become a habit. To help break this, use the mantra 1 - 2 - Stretch as you swim, the 1 and --- Page 107 Text --- 2 on non-breathing strokes and the Stretch when breathing

To help break this, use the mantra 1 - 2 - Stretch as you swim, the 1 and --- Page 107 Text --- 2 on non-breathing strokes and the Stretch when breathing to keep you focused on keeping the lead arm extended and offering you support. Developing Your Catch Step 2: Catch Mechanics The key to a great catch and pull through is to press the water backwards using the hand and forearm as a paddle. Pushing the water downward or to the side harms the catch and wastes a great deal of energy. To help you develop your catch we are going to use three main drills: Scull #1, Scull #2 and Doggy Paddle. Each will help you get a feel for pressing the water backwards in a bent elbow position. PAUL: Any time you struggle to perform a drill I think you should actually look at this as a positive: you’ve simply uncovered an area of your stroke technique or proprioception that needs work and you stand to benefit greatly from working on it! Sculling is a very valuable exercise, which helps to develop your ‘feel for the water’ – learning how the water should feel to you during the catch and how to time the stroke movements to create good propulsion. Most swimmers find sculling challenging at first but that’s OK, follow our pointers carefully and you will soon get better at it. --- Page 108 Text --- SCULL #1 Referring to the full drill description for Scull #1 in Appendix A, push off down the lap with a pull buoy between your legs and raise your head above the surface. Start sculling the water left and right in

by developing an improved catch technique. This will give you a more fluid stroke and will also lift your stroke rate slightly, giving your swimming a renewed sense of rhythm. --- Page 115 Text --- UNCO DRILL The Unco drill is described fully in Appendix A and is a one-arm drill performed with the inactive arm resting by the swimmer’s side. Using fins is essential to propel you through the water as the active arm recovers over the top. Breathe on every stroke away from the stroking arm. The key to Unco is to emphasise your body rotation, particularly thinking about the shoulder of your inactive arm and dipping it down low into the water as the active arm recovers over the surface. A good mantra for the drill is ‘breathe and dip, breathe and dip . . .’ to help you remember to breathe away from the stroking arm and emphasise dipping the inactive shoulder and hip. PAUL: Australians are fond of shortening words and Unco is Aussie slang for uncoordinated! It’s quite an advanced drill and you may struggle with coordinating it at first, particularly if your stroke timing needs some work. The irony is that when you get this drill right it is anything but uncoordinated as it forces you to time your stroke to your body rotation without the assistance of the recovering arm. The transition to full-stroke swimming is important as you will feel an immediate benefit to your stroke’s timing. We suggest you swim sets of Unco as 100 m continuously: 25 m left arm Unco (breathing to the right) 25 m freestyle (only breathing to the right) 25 m right arm Unco (breathing to the left) 25 m freestyle (only breathing to the left) As you transition into the freestyle portions you should

sets of Unco as 100 m continuously: 25 m left arm Unco (breathing to the right) 25 m freestyle (only breathing to the right) 25 m right arm Unco (breathing to the left) 25 m freestyle (only breathing to the left) As you transition into the freestyle portions you should feel a nice easy rhythm to your stroke. ADAM: In Chapter 10 we discussed how good swimming posture helps connect the arm stroke to the body, allowing your body rotation to assist in driving the stroke. To maximise this transfer of power, the swimmer also needs good timing of the arm stroke in relation to the body roll. As a former Overglider with poor timing Unco is personally my favourite drill, it’s fantastic for tuning up the timing of my stroke. WATERPOLO DRILL Head-up Waterpolo swimming is a great drill to help upper-intermediate and advanced level swimmers to improve the rhythm of their stroke. It is especially effective for removing dead spots from stroke timing as it is almost impossible to swim head-up with a long pause in the stroke! As described in Appendix A, the key to the drill is to swim it quickly at near sprint pace to really focus you on a fast stroke rate. Perform it with your chin on the surface for just 25 m at a time. If you struggle to complete the drill well try it with fins to give you more lift and drive. Perform the drill as 4 × 25 m Waterpolo with about 15 seconds rest between each 25 m. Immediately transition into 100 m of steady paced swimming focusing on an easy rhythm to the stroke. PULL BUOY AND BANDS Swimming with a pull buoy between your legs and a rubber band around your ankles is a simple way

of symmetry and problematic hand entries. e.g. in (1) the thumb-first could potentially cause an injury. Do not shoot from this angle alone as it does not show many stroke flaws. The Overhead View (2, 3, 4) is perhaps the most confronting view you can see of your stroke as it immediately highlights one of the most common flaws – a mid-line crossover that leads to a scissor kicking of the legs (2), causing significant drag. This angle also examines how your breathing pattern (unilateral or bilateral) affects your stroke’s symmetry. If you are either a Bambino (4) or an Overglider (3) you will be able to see how your stroke timing is affecting your stroke. Overgliders can spot a near catch-up in their stroke and Bambinos will notice their lead hand collapsing down so that they lack any support in front of the head while breathing. --- Page 137 Text --- The Perfect Side View (5, 6, 7) is your first glimpse of how your body position may be holding you back in the water and what might be causing this. From above the water it is easy to misinterpret how high your legs sit but from this angle under the water we can easily see how much ‘sinky’ legs might be holding you back (5). This is also a great angle to see how pressing down at the front of the stroke is one of the primary causes of ‘Sinky Leg Syndrome’. --- Page 138 Text --- For Overgliders, this is a very powerful image to demonstrate how your catch-up style (6) can lead you to overglide and apply the brakes at the front of your stroke (7).

Overgliders, this is a very powerful image to demonstrate how your catch-up style (6) can lead you to overglide and apply the brakes at the front of your stroke (7). Given that many true Overgliders are intentionally targeting a slow stroke rate, you can see here how applying the brakes would slow your stroke rate down – for this reason putting on the brakes and Overgliding are strongly linked. Use the process in Chapter 13 to develop a better catch technique and your stroke rate will naturally lift, returning a nice sense of rhythm to your stroke. --- Page 139 Text --- The Front View (8) shows parts of the catch and pull-through in more detail. If you are a more advanced swimmer you may be wondering how you can improve your catch – this angle will give you a prime insight into that. What is the angle of your elbow bend during the pull-through? Is it greater than 140° or less than 90°? If so your catch probably needs some refining (8). Many swimmers will press down with a straight arm rather than bending the elbow and pressing backwards. You are also looking to examine the amount of bubbles coming off the arms too. If you fight the water you will see a sleeve of bubbles compared to someone with an efficient stroke having a clean pull-through. Other flaws to watch out for from this angle are crossing over of the centre line under the body (9) and also whether you are holding your breathing underwater – we should see a constant stream of bubbles exiting from either your nose or mouth. --- Page 140 Text --- PAUL: One word of caution when performing your own video analysis: don’t become so pedantic about your stroke that you invoke ‘paralysis

whether you are holding your breathing underwater – we should see a constant stream of bubbles exiting from either your nose or mouth. --- Page 140 Text --- PAUL: One word of caution when performing your own video analysis: don’t become so pedantic about your stroke that you invoke ‘paralysis by analysis’. Rome wasn’t built in a day, so after breaking your stroke down work on a single aspect at a time, this will be much more productive than trying to change everything at once. As you go along, use the Stroke Technique (Key 1) chapters of this book to recognise the Cause and Effect nature of your stroke flaws and discover what the underlying causes are. Remember: one at a time! Should We All Swim The Same? --- Page 141 Text --- CHAPTER 17 The Swim Types System Coaching the Swimmer, Not the Stroke Since Swim Smooth’s creation in 2004, we’ve talked a lot about the need for an individual approach in swimming; how swimmers needed to work on different aspects of their technique based on their age, height, experience, gender and even personality. In contrast to this, many traditional swimming programmes treat everyone the same and have them repeat the same visualisations and drills constantly with one ideal stroke in mind. This one-dimensional approach has several major disadvantages: Ceinwen is 1.60 m tall and Andy is 2.00 m. Should these two swimmers adopt the same stroke style? The vision of a perfect stroke may not suit the swimmer’s physical attributes e.g. height, strength, gender, natural buoyancy. The starting point of the swimmer is ignored and so the coaching is never tailored to their individual needs. As a consequence their rate of progress is dramatically slowed or stops completely. --- Page 142 Text --- No account is taken of

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
conventional logic. They only respond slightly to balance and streamlining exercises (the approach for an Arnie for instance) but make much larger improvements by working on their catch and stroke rate, which is traditionally left to more advanced swimmers. This is because they have such poor feel for the water and are so lacking in rhythm that they find it very hard to progress without some attention in these areas first. --- Page 157 Text --- the bambino Many Bambinos are quite short with small hands and short arms. This means that a long gliding stroke style is unlikely to work well for them. If you are a Bambino be very wary of adding a glide into your stroke as more than any other type you are vulnerable to the inefficiencies of doing so. A faster stroke rate style with more ‘oomph’ will work for you much more effectively. PAUL: If you can find a nice friendly swim group or squad we highly recommend that you join their sessions. Whilst you won’t be the fastest swimmer there, having other swimmers around you will push you along and help you achieve things you didn’t know you could do! This really will do wonders for your confidence and give you a real buzz of achievement!

This is a contributing factor to a Bambino’s anxiety in the water. A slow stroke that lacks rhythm and ‘oomph’. The more anxious a Bambino is in the water, the less positivity there is in their stroke movements. A poor ‘feel for the water’ where the arms slip through with very little purchase or propulsion. Like Arnies, Bambinos often kick from the knee with a jittery action, which creates a lot of drag and pulls the body low in the water. --- Page 159 Text --- A tendency to cross over in front of the head, which further reduces ‘feel for the water’. This poor feel means that the lead hand collapses down when breathing offering very little support. This is why breathing feels challenging to many Bambinos and they commonly take on water when trying to breathe. Poor kicking technique, often kicking from the knee. This is hard work as it uses

This poor feel means that the lead hand collapses down when breathing offering very little support. This is why breathing feels challenging to many Bambinos and they commonly take on water when trying to breathe. Poor kicking technique, often kicking from the knee. This is hard work as it uses the large muscle groups of the quadriceps and hamstrings, and it creates large amounts of drag. A tendency to push the water upwards rather than backwards at the rear of the stroke. This upwards push pulls the legs downward and does not create any propulsion. For the full Bambino stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 160 Text --- CHAPTER 20 The Kicktastic --- Page 161 Text --- Like Bambinos, Kicktastics are often female but unlike Bambinos, they normally have a background in swimming to a greater or lesser extent. As the name suggests, they have a dominant 6-beat kick which powers them through a relatively poor catch phase of the arm stroke in front of the head. They generate very little propulsion from the front of their stroke and make up for this with a push from the legs. Many Kicktastics swam as a young child and then stopped swimming in their teens. This is a very common scenario as young kids always swim with a dominant leg kick before they develop the arm length and proprioceptive feel required for good upper-body propulsion. When Kicktastics resume swimming as an adult they carry on where they left off with the trademark Kicktastic style. PAUL: The problem with over-kicking is that it’s such an inefficient source of propulsion. If we could transfer your propulsion over to your arm stroke you would be swimming much quicker or much easier at the same speed. Despite having a very dominant kick, the action

the trademark Kicktastic style. PAUL: The problem with over-kicking is that it’s such an inefficient source of propulsion. If we could transfer your propulsion over to your arm stroke you would be swimming much quicker or much easier at the same speed. Despite having a very dominant kick, the action is so familiar to Kicktastics that most are unaware of how hard they are kicking. Ironically, many feel their kick is quite weak! In some cases this may be true in terms of propulsion — although all Kicktastics have a vigorous kick, some do not have very good kicking technique and so generate very little propulsion despite the high level of effort. Kicktastics like to kick and kick hard! --- Page 162 Text --- One disadvantage of working so hard with the legs is that it uses a huge amount of oxygen in the body making many Kicktastics short of breath when they swim. Most are aware of this shortness of breath and assume that there’s something wrong with their fitness. ADAM: A good way to prove that it’s the kick causing your shortness of breath is to swim with a pull buoy and keep your legs held straight behind you. Despite potentially being slower as you lose your propulsion from the legs, monitor your breathing and if it feels much easier then that’s cast- iron proof you’re over-kicking in your stroke. Kicktastics vary hugely in terms of swimming speed, ranging between 2:00 per 100 m to under 1:20 per 100 m depending on their level of arm propulsion and also the effectiveness of their kicking technique. At the very fast end there is a crossover with the Smooth Swim Type who also use a propulsive 6-beat kick, albeit with extremely good arm propulsion too! For obvious reasons Kicktastics dislike

physical) you deserve to swim much more effectively in this environment. Overglider Key Stroke Flaws The Overglider’s dominant stroke flaw is a large dead spot in their stroke timing caused by the introduction of a long glide into their stroke. Working on their catch technique and developing their stroke rhythm will get them off the speed and efficiency plateau they find themselves on. A long pause-and-glide is always present at the front of an Overglider’s stroke, interrupting their rhythm and causing them to decelerate significantly during the resultant dead spot. Many Overgliders’ recovering arms ‘catch up’ at the front giving what is known as ‘catch-up timing’. A much better timing is where the hands just pass in front of the head with the stroking arm already into the catch phase as the recovering arm comes past the head. A poor catch technique with the elbow dropping and very often the palm of the hand facing forwards ‘putting on the brakes’. This is a by-product of trying to swim with a long slow stroke style since the poor catch technique acts to slow the stroke down (see Chapter 13) and so supports the desire to glide. After the glide, the swimmer has to rush the catch to get the stroke back underway. A hurried catch action causes the hand to slip backwards with very little purchase on the water. It is common to see Overgliders only breathing to one side as they swim, normally this is because their stroke rate is so slow that it’s too long between breaths to breathe every three strokes. Over time breathing to one side develops a lopsided stroke with a lack of symmetry, this is particularly a problem for open water swimming where it can cause the swimmer to track off course constantly. After the

so slow that it’s too long between breaths to breathe every three strokes. Over time breathing to one side develops a lopsided stroke with a lack of symmetry, this is particularly a problem for open water swimming where it can cause the swimmer to track off course constantly. After the long glide phase, Overgliders literally have to kick-start their strokes with a large knee-driven kick. --- Page 169 Text --- A pulsing kick is often used to kick-start the stroke again after the long glide phase. To create the required impetus to restart the stroke the knee is often bent too far during the kick, creating drag and harming the swimmer’s body rotation. A light flutter kick is normally much more appropriate for Overgliders as it keeps the body position high and helps maintain stroke rhythm. For the full Overglider stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 170 Text --- CHAPTER 22 The Swinger --- Page 171 Text --- PAUL: If I told you about a swimmer who takes around 50 to 52 strokes per 50 m lap of the pool it’s unlikely you’d be very impressed, you might think they couldn’t be a very good swimmer — they should be taking far fewer strokes per length than that. But what if I told you that swimmer was Frenchwoman Laure Manadou who won Olympic Gold in the 400 m freestyle at the 2004 Athens Olympics and also held the world records at 200 m and 400 m? Laure and swimmers like her defy the conventional swimming logic that you must always swim with a long stroke in order to be efficient. Here lies the Swinger: fast and efficient but unappreciated and unloved — until now! See Laure swim here: www.swimsmooth.com/manadou Swingers are nearly always experienced swimmers with many years

swimmers. In either case this needs to be rectified because of the high risk of shoulder injury from a thumb-first entry — in fact many Swingers already suffer from shoulder pain for this reason. A hurried catch phase results from a Swinger’s desire to get on and swim at a high tempo. Taking a little longer over the catch will allow the swimmer to get into a better high-elbow catch position and gain a better purchase on the water. Many Swingers have become a little too flat in the water over the years and need to stretch out just a little more in their strokes. The right balance always needs to be struck between stroke length and stroke rate — whilst a Swinger definitely sits towards the shorter faster end of this spectrum it’s possible to take this a little too far and ‘over-rev’. In these cases adding a touch more stroke length is recommended. Sam shows us three common Swinger flaws in one photo: holding breath, thumb-first entry and crossing the centre line underwater. Despite their experience as swimmers, Swingers can be some of the worst culprits when it comes to holding their breath under water. By improving their exhalation technique Swingers should be able to breathe bilaterally quite easily; in fact with their fast stroke rate breathing every five strokes may be an option. For the full Swinger stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 175 Text --- CHAPTER 23 The Smooth --- Page 176 Text --- The Smooth Swim Type is what everybody thinks of when they imagine a long efficient stroke style. They are the envy of the pool with their relaxed style moving them seemingly effortlessly through the water accompanied by a 6-beat kick. They are strong technically in all areas with great turns

Over-kicking slightly (perhaps becoming a little Kicktastic) is another common flaw with Smooths and is related to that slight deterioration in arm stroke propulsion. When you restore your catch and ‘feel for the water’ to its former glory this leg kick will fall away naturally and you’ll notice the reduced oxygen demand from a less vigorous kick. --- Page 179 Text --- Michelle is a classic Smooth who’s been out of the water for a while. Her kicking technique and exhalation is still in good order but she’s just overreaching a little and dropping her elbow a touch. This will harm her ‘feel for the water’. A slight overglide with the wrist dropping on arm extension is another common flaw if the Smooth has been trying to emphasise the length of their stroke. With so much literature on the internet focusing on this aspect of swimming technique it’s little wonder some Smooths are influenced by it and introduce a small glide into their stroke timing. Professional triathlete Guy Crawford is a Smooth who needs a little tune-up with his catch technique. He’s about to bend his elbow to catch the water but he needs to do this a little sooner — we should already start to see the elbow bend in this shot. Holding onto your breath is something that is taught to many sprinters, which by definition includes most Smooths! With a powerful sprint kick, the extra buoyancy in the chest does not cause the swimmer’s legs to sink and effective breathing is not critical over sprint distances. However for distance freestyle it’s very important to use a constant smooth exhalation whenever your face is in the water. Late breathing timing is a surprisingly common flaw seen in Smooths.

and effective breathing is not critical over sprint distances. However for distance freestyle it’s very important to use a constant smooth exhalation whenever your face is in the water. Late breathing timing is a surprisingly common flaw seen in Smooths. This occurs where the rotation of the head to breathe is a little late, following after the rotation of the body when it should in fact be simultaneous. This reduces the time available to inhale and makes breathing feel quite hurried — work on fixing this and you’ll notice a major improvement in your level of relaxation. For the full Smooth stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 180 Text --- KEY 2 Training Specific fitness training for swimming --- Page 181 Text --- CHAPTER 24 The Importance of Fitness Training The sport of triathlon has seen a huge boom in the last 10 to 15 years and with it a large influx of people with little or no swimming background taking up the sport for the first time. More recently, open water swimming events have experienced a similar boom allowing those enthusiastic swimmers who have previously been stuck within the confines of their local pool to appreciate the freedom of swimming in some amazing open water locations. Whilst the challenge of training for the three sports of triathlon might be unattainable for those with busy professional and family lives, training for open water swimming is much more achievable and equally rewarding. At Swim Smooth we are passionate about open water swimming and are very excited about the growing number of open water events and challenges available for swimmers around the world. Even if you don’t view yourself as being a super-competitive person and are more interested in achievements and self-fulfilment than competitive placings, you still stand to gain

Text --- When it comes to swimming, a big limiting factor for many triathletes is a lack of flexibility. Poor flexibility can give rise to many stroke technique flaws including crossovers, dropped elbows and sinking legs, all of which will severely limit your potential in the water. Swim, bike and run training keeps us very busy but improving your flexibility doesn’t have to eat into your training time, you can make some big improvements by performing a stretching routine in front of the TV in the evening. In particular, triathletes and swimmers needs to focus on the following areas when stretching: Upper back / shoulders. Hips. Ankles. Studies show that to avoid injury athletes should either stretch regularly or not at all [1] — it tends to be those athletes who stretch every now and again that experience issues with muscle injury and strains. For this reason you should keep stretching regularly to avoid injury and always warm up properly beforehand. Think of your muscles and tendons as a little like toffee — when cold they are brittle and subject to micro-tears if over-stretched, with some gentle mobilisation and warming up they become a lot more pliable. Stretching prior to a training session should only be used to gently loosen off and not to develop muscle length or range of motion. Such work is best left until after training or in a specific stretching session where you warm up beforehand. Stretches should never be painful and should never use a bouncing action. Aim to hold each stretch for approximately 20 seconds and repeat each two to three times. Practise deep controlled breathing while stretching. Stretching: Upper Back and Shoulders Doorway Chest Stretch. Standing in a doorway or beside a post, place your arm in the position shown with your elbow

bouncing action. Aim to hold each stretch for approximately 20 seconds and repeat each two to three times. Practise deep controlled breathing while stretching. Stretching: Upper Back and Shoulders Doorway Chest Stretch. Standing in a doorway or beside a post, place your arm in the position shown with your elbow at a right angle. Gently press forwards with your chest and feel the stretch across the front of your shoulder and through the pectoral (chest) muscle. Avoid pushing the shoulder itself too far forward — instead think of drawing your shoulder blades together and back. --- Page 211 Text --- Telescope Arms and Rotation Stretch. This looks complicated but is easy when you get the hang of it! Start by lying on your side with knees bent to approximately 90° and one hand on top of the other. Take a deep breath in and as you exhale rotate the top arm all the way over to open yourself out into a crucifix position whilst following the arm with your gaze. Take a few deep breaths in this position and feel your back and shoulders sinking into the ground with every exhale. This fantastic stretch develops your chest, shoulder and back mobility all in one. Take care to perform it in a slow controlled manner and do not attempt it if you have had any major back problems in the past. --- Page 212 Text --- Triceps and Lats Stretch.

performing what is called an anterior pelvic tilt (arch back) and a posterior pelvic tilt (flatten back). 7. Now to locate your neutral spine, find the middle position between flattening and arching your back. Here are four simple exercises that you can use to improve your core conditioning: Controlled Roll Ups Lie flat on your back on the floor, legs straight out in front of you placing your arms and hands by your sides. Gently and slowly lift your head off the floor and draw your lower stomach to spine as you slowly start to sit up. Slowly breathe in as you continue sitting up until you are straight, then pause. Begin rolling back down whilst breathing out. Start at your pelvis and slowly unfold your spine as you return to the starting position. Repeat 10—15 times. --- Page 216 Text --- Bridging Lie flat on your back, find your neutral spine and draw your lower stomach in. Slowly push down through your feet and lift your bottom right up so that your trunk is straight with your shoulders, hips and knees in a line. Breathe in as you lift and out as you lower, and hold the lift for 5—10 seconds thinking of squeezing your buttocks as you lift. Repeat 10—15 times. Wall Squats Standing with your back to the wall take one step away with both feet whilst keeping your back to the wall. Your toes should be in line and slightly turned out. Find your neutral spine position and draw your lower stomach in. Holding this position, slowly perform a half squat keeping your bottom against the wall. Hold the squat for five seconds and then lift to return to the start. Complete three sets of twelve squats. --- Page 217 Text --- Front Plank Place your

were taught that body rotation along the long axis of the spine was a bad thing and a waste of effort (5). Conversely in the 1990s there was a strong and concerted effort to encourage swimmers to rotate to a full 90° by ‘stacking their shoulders’. Neither method is correct but both still persist in some swimming programmes today. To avoid shoulder injury, good body rotation between 45° and 60° is essential on every stroke (not just when you are breathing) and aids the recovery phase of the freestyle stroke by allowing the arm to clear the surface of the water without excessive internal rotation of the shoulder. This is best demonstrated by the land-based exercises as listed in Chapter 11. To avoid shoulder injury and improve your stroke efficiency, aim for rotation along the central axis of the spine demonstrated by Miss Smooth (6). A Straight Arm Catch and Pull-Through A straight arm pull-through is another very common stroke flaw and is a precursor to shoulder injury in many cases. When the arm pulls through with a straight elbow (7) it --- Page 229 Text --- creates a large amount of force on the unstable and relatively weak shoulder and rotator cuff muscles. This is exacerbated if the swimmer trains with large hand paddles as they put further force through the shoulder when in a very compromised position. Large hand paddles have a bad reputation for causing injury for this reason, but it is not directly the fault of the paddle, it is poor technique combined with a large paddle that creates shoulder injury. In fact when used in moderation with a bent elbow pull (8), hand paddles carry a very low injury risk. An Excessive Flick at the Exit (Push) Phase Some coaches and swim programmes encourage their

a progression move your arms over your head in a snow angel fashion to increase the stretch and lengthen out the muscles at the front of the shoulders (4). 2. Telescope Arms Referring to Figure 30.22 lie on your side with your knees and hips bent to 90° and your arms stretched out, one on top of the other at shoulder height. Begin the stretch by reaching your top hand past your bottom hand as though you are reaching toward the wall in front of you. Keeping your elbow straight and rotating from your trunk upwards (avoiding rolling your hips), reach your arm toward the ceiling and back toward the opposite wall as though you are carving an arc in the air. Your goal is to finish the stretch with your upper shoulder on the floor. Repeat four to six times on each side. FIGURE 30.22 Telescope Arms Exercise --- Page 232 Text --- 3. Scapular Setting Scapular setting is important to re-establish a more balanced position of the humeral head (ball) in the glenoid fossa (socket) thus improving your overall shoulder posture. Sitting upright in a comfortable chair, gently pull your chin in and open your chest. As you do so, imagine pulling the lower part of your shoulder blades together without arching your back or throwing your rib cage forwards. Only a 30%-40% effort should be used to perform this exercise and you should not feel any tension in your shoulder blades or neck. Keep breathing normally and aim to hold the position for 1-2 minutes until it becomes comfortable, then aim to hold it for longer periods during the day.

in the air like a ‘posh’ person would walk around. This stops the common mistake of bringing the chin towards the chest, which causes the swimmer to sit up in the water and drop the legs and buttocks down low. Breaststroke — whilst used by many swimmers who cannot swim freestyle, breaststroke is actually the least economic and slowest stroke due to the width of the body cutting through the water during the wide ‘frog’ kick. The reason breaststroke is favoured by many swimmers is because of the ease of lifting the head out of the water to breathe. Coordinating breathing in the freestyle stroke can initially be quite daunting whereas breaststroke is significantly easier and for this reason is a very valid way of becoming accustomed to the water when starting out in swimming. One of the keys to a great backstroke is to make sure your head is pushed back into the water. --- Page 243 Text --- Good breaststrokers often have very good hip flexibility, which helps with the angles required to gain a propulsive kick. The key to a good breaststroke is good coordination between the arms and legs and to aim to reduce the frontal profile by not pulling or kicking too wide. A simple focal point for developing a better breaststroke is to focus on snapping your elbows into your sides as you pull through and then driving your arms forwards in as sleek a motion as you possibly can. Try visualising scooping out a bowl of cake mix with your hands as they pull through to develop this motion! A fast breaststroke uses a snappy arm movement, returning to the front of the stroke as soon as possible.

tackling anxieties is working out what it is that specifically brings on an attack — for example it could be swallowing some water and fearing you’re going to choke or perhaps losing your orientation and sense of direction. Other common triggers can be the cold itself, fear of the deep, fear of marine life or swimming into reeds. The reasons will be very personal to you and your circumstances. During the anxiety of an open water swim start it is essential that you block out everything around you and focus just on yourself. --- Page 253 Text --- 2. Become Selfish. When you’re training in the pool and thinking about your technique, you’re only ever concerned about yourself and how well you’re performing the exercise. The environment is calm and controlled and you can go about your task easily. As soon as you enter open water that calm internal focus can be rapidly replaced with thinking about external factors which are out of your control such as other swimmers, waves, fish, the thought of touching something, etc. A key skill for swimming well in open water is to block out those thoughts and return your focus on to you, your stroke and your breathing. We call this ‘becoming a selfish swimmer’! 3. Use Cue Words. Often referred to as mantras, repeating cue words such as ‘relax’, ‘breathe’, ‘control’, ‘smooth’ can help keep you focused on the here and now of each stroke rather than letting your mind wander to things out of your control. One of our best teaching mantras that also works well in the open water is ‘breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe’ as outlined in Chapter 7. Give it a try — simplicity of focus is key in the open water. 4.

out of your control. One of our best teaching mantras that also works well in the open water is ‘breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe’ as outlined in Chapter 7. Give it a try — simplicity of focus is key in the open water. 4. Practise With Friends. Any time you go for a swim in the open water you should set up some practice sets with a group of friends. Swimming in a group supports everyone’s safety in the water and with the support of non-threatening, non-competitive training partners you will really start to tune up your skills and grow your confidence. Practise some of the more advanced concepts like drafting and open water turns in the pool first so that you get a good head-start before using them in open water. PAUL: If you only remember one open water tip from this book, let it be to remember to exhale into the water at the start of a race. When the gun goes off far too many swimmers set off at break-neck speed, hold their breath and so become very tense. Holding your breath is a sure-fire way to trigger a panic attack and potentially ruin your whole race. By all means set off at a good pace but remember to breathe out under the water as though you are sighing and you’ll have a fantastic swim! --- Page 254 Text --- CHAPTER 35 Swimming Straighter --- Page 255 Text --- PAUL: We started this section with a very common question: ‘How fast do you think I can swim this event in the open water?’ I was asked this exact question by an athlete that had just started swimming with us in early 2010, prior to the Busselton Half Ironman.

have the technology to find out. Whilst Dan’s example might sound quite extreme, as we see more and more GPS data at Swim Smooth we find that swimming 10% or more too far in a race is really very common. If you don’t --- OCR from Page 255 Image 1 --- i. * Busselton Jetty, Western Australia Lap 1 ne --- Page 256 Text --- swim as well as you expect in open water then investing in a GPS watch and wearing it under your swim cap could be exactly what you need to find out what’s going wrong. For Dan discovering this and gaining the motivation to improve this aspect of his swimming was worth a massive 10 minutes over 1.9 km! Let’s take a look at some of the tactics Dan used to prepare more specifically for open water swimming: 1. Avoiding Crossovers As discussed in Chapter 10 of this book, crossing over in front of your head as your hand enters into the water is an extremely common stroke flaw; in open water that crossover pulls you constantly off course. Crossovers are normally at their worst when breathing as your thoughts are simply about getting in air and you forget your stroke alignment, so it is no coincidence that most swimmers go off course when breathing. Without the constraints of the pool lanes and a black line to follow you can be pulled a long way off line and add considerable distance to your swim. Use the side kicking drills and visualisation in Appendix A to improve your swimming posture and alignment in the water. Also shift your focus when breathing back to the alignment of your lead hand; to do this you might count each stroke by repeating to yourself ‘1-2- straight-1-2-straight’ where the word ‘straight’

side kicking drills and visualisation in Appendix A to improve your swimming posture and alignment in the water. Also shift your focus when breathing back to the alignment of your lead hand; to do this you might count each stroke by repeating to yourself ‘1-2- straight-1-2-straight’ where the word ‘straight’ coincides with your breathing stroke. 2. Bilateral Breathing and Frequency of Sighting We are big fans of bilateral breathing at Swim Smooth for the simple reason that it naturally helps maintain the symmetry of your stroke and so helps you swim straighter in open water. Even if you only treat bilateral breathing as a training practice you then have the choice of either side to breathe to unilaterally whilst racing. We have heard some swimming coaches state that you should only ever breathe to one side in open water as this gives you a greater oxygen uptake. This makes sense, however, usually the reason swimmers start to feel starved of oxygen is due to the fact that they are not exhaling properly into the water between breaths. By improving their exhalation such swimmers find it much easier to breathe bilaterally even at racing levels of effort. Also, as we mentioned earlier, holding onto your breath is never a good idea as it can bring on anxiety attacks followed by hyperventilation. Sighting technique sequence: lift your head just enough to sight forwards and then breathe to the side. --- Page 257 Text --- Many unilateral breathers accept the fact that they might lose stroke symmetry and swim off course as a result; to counter this they sight forwards more frequently to correct their course. The problem with this solution is that sighting carries an energy cost of its own as you have to lift your head to breathe which sinks your

might lose stroke symmetry and swim off course as a result; to counter this they sight forwards more frequently to correct their course. The problem with this solution is that sighting carries an energy cost of its own as you have to lift your head to breathe which sinks your legs downward even in a wetsuit. In an ideal world every swimmer would be able to swim so straight that they would never have to sight but everyone is eventually moved off course slightly by waves, current and even other swimmers. The key point here is that the less often you need to sight the faster you will swim and the best pathway to swimming straighter is bilateral breathing. --- Page 258 Text --- ADAM: You can experiment with keeping your eyes closed in a safe open water environment or an empty pool without lane ropes to see how straight you can swim. The furthest you can travel without moving off course is the answer to how often you should be sighting, give or take a few strokes – at least in calm conditions! Take caution when attempting this though, as hitting an object in the water when swimming can be potentially injurious! Another way of performing a similar exercise is to have your eyes closed when your head is down but then open your eyes whenever you go to sight forwards. This can help to simulate the sensation of swimming in murky water conditions. 3. Minimal Head Lift When Sighting Every swimmer needs to sight forwards in order to stay straight but developing the movement and timing of their sighting technique is something very few people practise regularly. The most common mistake to make when sighting forwards is to lift your whole face out of the water and try

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
ADAM: The other Swim Smooth coaches and I refer to something called the ‘Lane 1 Magneto Effect’. This is where the lane one swimmers in our squads gravitate towards each other despite us setting them off at 5 or 10 second intervals. Normally within 100 m-200 m of any set they are all circulating round as one big group in the lane! They have intuitively learned that there’s a distinct advantage to swimming close behind another swimmer and at the start of any swim put in a big effort to catch the person in front. 2. To the Side and Within the Wake of a Faster Swimmer Each swimmer creates a V-shaped wake when they move forwards in the water, the size of this wake will be determined by the size of the athlete and also their speed. By sitting to one side of the swimmer, positioned so that your head is somewhere between their hips and chest, you will be within this wake and can experience a very powerful drafting effect. The key to this skill is to be able to adjust your stroke rhythm so as to synchronise your stroke timing with theirs. This is important otherwise your arms will clash and both of you will become frustrated. A more technical way to draft is close to the side of the lead swimmer, within their wake. From the perspective of breathing easily it would make sense to breathe away from the person you are drafting so that you’re breathing into undisturbed water. --- Page 265 Text --- Unfortunately, doing this tends to pull you wide of the other swimmer, which can easily drop you out of the draft zone and lose you all the benefit of it. For this reason the golden rule is to always breathe in

breathing into undisturbed water. --- Page 265 Text --- Unfortunately, doing this tends to pull you wide of the other swimmer, which can easily drop you out of the draft zone and lose you all the benefit of it. For this reason the golden rule is to always breathe in towards the stronger swimmer even if this makes breathing itself slightly harder. This is one occasion where unilateral breathing (breathing to one side only) is advantageous to you. Of course you still need the ability to breathe to either side so that you can draft on either side of a swimmer as opportunities present themselves during a race. The perfect way to train in open water is by taking a coached skills session like this Swim Smooth one in Perth. A further advantage of drafting alongside another swimmer in this manner is that should you start to get dropped you can move directly behind to jump onto their feet, providing you with a very useful lifeline. PAUL: You will encounter situations in races where you are drafting another swimmer and feel that the pace is too easy for you. Before trying to break free by yourself, contemplate how much benefit you might be gaining from the draft and if this could explain why it feels quite slow. Often moving out of the draft and going solo becomes a shock as the extra effort of swimming by yourself suddenly catches up with you. You might also finish the swim and find the swimmer you overtook happily swimming on your toes! If you are really in a group of swimmers that are too slow for you then you will need to break free and swim solo but a better strategy might have been to start slightly quicker to find a better group

waters here in Perth and have found them to be amazingly quick. If your budget will stretch to one we’d highly recommend them for warm water swims. --- Page 275 Text --- CHAPTER 39 Adapting Your Stroke to a Variety of Conditions PAUL: In February 2011 I took a group of our Swim Smooth Perth squad swimmers down to the 4 km Busselton Jetty Swim, a three hour drive south of Perth. This is one of the most popular open water swims on the calendar and conditions are usually relatively flat. The Busselton Jetty is the longest jetty in the southern hemisphere and extends just under 2 km out to sea with a slight kink in the middle. Navigation in this event is relatively simple – keep the jetty on your left side all the way out to the end, swim round the very end of the jetty before returning on the other side, still keeping the jetty on your left. Simple. On this particular year though a strong wind had stirred the Indian Ocean up considerably with a significant swell running from right to left across the course as you looked out to sea. It made for extremely challenging conditions such that it was nearly impossible to breathe to the right on the outward leg and equally impossible to breathe to the left on the return leg. Attempting to breathe towards the direction of the oncoming swell resulted in a nasty mouthful of salty water! Those swimmers unable to adapt their breathing patterns were at a severe disadvantage, which saw over 60% of the field withdraw from the race. Just three days before the event I had set a training session for my swimmers of 15 × 100 m with 20 seconds rest between each. The goal was to

adapt their breathing patterns were at a severe disadvantage, which saw over 60% of the field withdraw from the race. Just three days before the event I had set a training session for my swimmers of 15 × 100 m with 20 seconds rest between each. The goal was to hold their best maintainable pace for the whole set. This set is nothing new or unique and all the swimmers had performed this sort of set before. What we did do though was instruct all the swimmers that they must only breathe to their left for the first five repetitions, only to their right for the next five repetitions and finally bilaterally (every three strokes to both sides) for the last five repetitions. Looking at the weather forecast it was my belief that the conditions down in Busselton could prove challenging and I didn’t want to risk the old adage of ‘failing to plan is planning to fail’. During the set the swimmers monitored their times per 100 m for each of the three breathing patterns to identify how much faster and more comfortable they were on one side versus the other. What was very interesting was that whilst for some breathing to their weaker side felt unusual, the time differential to their stronger side was much smaller than anticipated. This simply showed the swimmers that if they had to breathe to their non- dominant side because of conditions, they wouldn’t lose much or any time in doing so. This was a great confidence booster to them when they got in the water on race day. I’m very pleased to report that of the 34 squad members who raced from our team, not a single person pulled out of the event and of the 1000+ entrants we claimed three top-10

as you swim is an essential skill for efficient freestyle. Exhaling constantly sounds easy but can be a challenge to get the feel of to begin with, especially if you have many years of holding your breath underwater behind you. --- Page 284 Text --- To help develop your exhalation technique use this sink down exercise at the deep end of your pool. Sink downs are an excellent way to start your swimming session, even before your warm-up. Tread water and take a breath before bringing your arms down by your side and start exhaling into the water. You’re aiming to sink straight down to the bottom without any pauses or delays. Experiment between exhaling from your mouth and nose to see which is most natural to you. Tipping Point When you exhale you may find that you struggle to sink or that you might sink a little and then come back up to the surface. That’s a sign that you’re not exhaling quickly --- Page 285 Text --- enough and that perhaps you are subconciously holding on to your breath. If you initially sink a little but then immediately return to the surface don’t give up, keep exhaling! You will find that you pass through a tipping point and then start to sink down again. As you continue to practise your sink downs aim to get to this point more quickly and sink straight down without the initial delay near the surface. Relaxation The key to getting rid of the air in your lungs is relaxation, if you’re anxious in the water then this will hold you back from exhaling properly. Imagine you’ve had a stressfull day at work and you get home and collapse onto the couch with a big sigh. That is exactly the feeling you’re aiming

the air in your lungs is relaxation, if you’re anxious in the water then this will hold you back from exhaling properly. Imagine you’ve had a stressfull day at work and you get home and collapse onto the couch with a big sigh. That is exactly the feeling you’re aiming for as you swim – the sensation of sighing into the water. Also experiment with making sounds as you exhale. Try a ‘brrrrrr’ sound through your lips like a motorbike or humming through your nose. As overly simple as this sounds, these cues really can help you tune into exhaling into the water in a relaxed way. Caution for Beginners If you are new to freestyle swimming it is well worth getting a friend or coach into the water with you to make you feel more comfortable. A bit of moral support can go a long way here as you become accustomed to having your face under the water. Three in a Row When you are able to sink down smoothly and quickly, move on to performing three sink downs in a row. This makes the timing much more like swimming: Take a breath and sink down ridding your lungs of air, when you are empty of air push off and return to the surface. As soon as you surface take an easy deep breath in and sink down straight away again. --- Page 286 Text --- Repeat this three times through. The key point to this exercise is that you are either inhaling or exhaling, you are never holding your breath. As soon as you have completed the three sink downs, push off from the end of the pool and start swimming using the breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe mantra. breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe

you are either inhaling or exhaling, you are never holding your breath. As soon as you have completed the three sink downs, push off from the end of the pool and start swimming using the breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe mantra. breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe As you swim repeat the phrase breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe to yourself. Literally say ‘bubble’ into the water to remind you to exhale; on a breathing stroke say breathe to yourself as you rotate and take a breath in. This mantra helps you to coordinate bilateral breathing and exhalation together. We’re confident that you’ll find it useful to combine these two important areas of good freestyle stroke technique. Ballet Leg Kick Ballet Leg Kick focuses on improving your kicking technique so as to reduce drag and improve your body position in the water.

Move on to swimming 200 m easy freestyle thinking solely about your chosen focus. You can return to your chosen visualisation any time you swim if you feel as though your stroke is becoming ragged. Kick on Side Kicking on your side seems like a simple idea but don’t let that fool you, this is a very powerful drill. This exercise and its progressions, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6, are at the core of the Swim Smooth drill pack. Traditionally swim coaches used side-kicking exercises to help swimmer’s become accustomed with swimming on their side to develop their body rotation. This is a worthy goal but Swim Smooth use these drills to develop two other critical parts of the freestyle stroke: The swimmer’s posture and alignment in the water. An excellent catch set up position. Use these drills to improve these two aspects of your swimming and you can dramatically increase your speed and efficiency in the water. --- Page 291 Text --- Side Kicking Use fins and push off from the end of the pool, bringing yourself perfectly onto your side at 90°. Kick at a steady pace and take your lower arm out in front of you and rest your top arm lightly by your side. Face downward and exhale into the water whilst you are kicking. When you need to take a breath simply turn your head to breathe before returning it to the water: --- Page 292 Text --- Without any further thought, try this exercise and see how you perform. Do you track straight or weave about in the lane? Perform a single arm stroke to swap sides after 25 m, are you better or worse on the other side? Now try the exercise again and become aware of the position of your lead hand. Is it

Continue on this side for six more kicks before swapping sides again. As you perform the arm stroke recover the back hand over the top of the water first and keep the lead hand in position. Let your hands nearly catch-up in front of your head before starting the underwater stroke to rotate onto your other side. In your full stroke you would not fully catch-up in front of your head in this manner but this is good technique for 6-1-6. If you are a Bambino or an Arnie Swim Type you may find that you have a strong tendency for the lead hand to collapse down before the recovering arm reaches it. That’s fine and perfectly normal. If you struggle to keep it in front, try using something as a relay baton, in Perth we use Berrocca vitamin tubes. Keep this tube held between the thumb and first finger of your lead hand and when the top hand comes over, transfer it into your other hand. This will help you coordinate the catch up action. The timing of the breathing is important in 6-1-6: take the breath immediately after the stroke, not before! So the drill is really 6-1-breathe-6. This makes the breathing timing as close as possible to full stroke freestyle. 6-1-6 challenges you to maintain your hand positions and posture during the arm stroke. It’s common to see swimmers crossover or drop their elbow as the new hand enters the water and then immediately correct themselves. Instead of doing this, aim to enter straight into the correct position by maintaining

6-1-6 challenges you to maintain your hand positions and posture during the arm stroke. It’s common to see swimmers crossover or drop their elbow as the new hand enters the water and then immediately correct themselves. Instead of doing this, aim to enter straight into the correct position by maintaining your posture during the stroke. A good indication that you are doing this right is in how straight you are able to track down the pool. Over-Rotation With side-kicking drills you may feel unstable on your side as if you are going to topple onto your back. If your lead hand is not crossing over in front of your head then the cause is likely to be that you are slightly over-rotated beyond 90°. To improve this, bring your resting hand towards the front of the thigh as if it is in a jeans pocket. That should help you regain your balance. It’s worth highlighting that whilst these drills bring you to 90° of rotation, in your normal stroke we are looking for 45–60°. The drills emphasise the rotataion with the --- Page 296 Text --- view that you will transfer some of it into your full stroke. 6-3-6 As a further progression to 6-1-6, kick on the side for six kicks before performing three strokes, each nearly catching up in front of your head. Perform each stroke with perfect alignment and a great catch set-up position - fingertips below wrist and wrist below elbow. If you can, breathe immediately after the three strokes: 6-3-breathe-6. If that’s too little breathing, add in a breath during the arm strokes as well. Middle Finger Visualisation A useful visualisation whilst side kicking, and during the arm strokes in 6-1-6 and 6-3- 6, is to think solely about the middle finger on your lead

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
after the three strokes: 6-3-breathe-6. If that’s too little breathing, add in a breath during the arm strokes as well. Middle Finger Visualisation A useful visualisation whilst side kicking, and during the arm strokes in 6-1-6 and 6-3- 6, is to think solely about the middle finger on your lead hand and where it is pointing. Keep it pointing straight down the lane at all times. Use this visualisation during full- stroke freestyle too, to help you maintain your alignment as you swim and avoid crossovers. Progressing to Full-Stroke Freestyle The sequence of side kicking, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 progressively builds up the freestyle stroke whilst focusing on your posture and alignment in the water and your catch set-up position with the elbow higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips. The next step is to perform some full-stroke freestyle. We recommend that you perform this immediately after performing the drills, whilst you still have your fins on. For instance: 3x 100 m as : 25 m kick on left side + 25 m kick on right side + 50 m freestyle 4x 100 m as : 2x : 50 m 6-1-6 + 50 m freestyle 2x : 50 m 6-3-6 + 50 m freestyle As you enter into full-stroke freestyle following the drill think about maintaining your alignment and extending your hand in front of the same shoulder. For examples of how we recommend integrating these drills into full training sessions see Appendix C. Broken Arrow The Broken Arrow drill is designed for swimmers with tight shoulders and upper backs to help them loosen off. It’s a derivative of the 6-1-6 drill and should always be performed wearing fins. --- Page 297 Text --- As in 6-1-6, kick on the side but without delay take the top

Drill Unco is a special drill which helps you to develop the rhythm and timing of your stroke. We love Unco at Swim Smooth as it brings so many elements of your stroke together and forces you to time your catch, pull and body rotation correctly. You can even use it to polish up the timing of your breathing. Australians love to shorten any word and put an ‘o’ on the end - in this case shortening ‘uncoordinated’ to make Unco. This probably tells you straight away that it is quite a challenging drill! We’d encourage any swimmer to give it a try but it is probably best suited and most beneficial for upper-intermediate and advanced level swimmers. If you are a bit of an Overglider or have any dead spots or pauses in your stroke then you’ll find Unco challenging but very useful. Unless you have an exceptionally propulsive kick, always use fins when performing Unco. It’s a one-arm drill, performed with one arm by your side whilst the other arm performs a full stroke. Try 4 × 100 m with each 100 m swum as: 25 m left arm Unco + 25 m freestyle breathing right + 25 m right arm Unco + 25 m freestyle breathing left How Should It Feel? Since you are only using one arm with a gap between strokes, Unco is always going to have a surge to it: the surge should be forwards with the propulsion coming from the stroking arm. If you feel like you are bobbing up and down a lot then this highlights that you are pressing down on the water at the front of the stroke. This only lifts you up, which doesn’t generate any propulsion and acts to sink your legs, creating drag. If you feel like

or a priority for you right now. The Arnie: plenty of power, needs more control! --- Page 315 Text --- PAUL: As an Arnie you may feel impatient to become a strong swimmer but ironically that may be one of the things holding you back. You need to slow things down a touch and work on areas of your stroke technique at a slower pace. I often tell swimmers such as yourself to recognise that impatience and to ‘Tame The Arnie!’. You won’t have a problem speeding things back up in the long run but taking the time and patiently working on your stroke technique is so important for your progress. 1. Develop your exhalation technique using the Sink Down and Breathe - Bubble - Bubble - Breathe exercises, you are looking to exhale as if sighing into the water – it is not as easy as it sounds to let that air go! Try to relax and develop a real sense of calmness as you perform these exercises and with your swimming in general. You may be surprised at how relaxed you can become whilst swimming. 2. Improve your breathing technique by keeping your head lower as you swim using the bow wave, Popeye Breathing and Split Screen visualisations. Refer to Chapter 7 for more information. 3. Tune up your kicking technique using the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick and Swim Back exercises. These may seem overly simple but they can make a huge difference to your body position and so your drag profile in the water. As you swim after these drills become aware of how high your legs are in the water, you are looking to feel your ankles gently breaking the surface but do not do that by bending at the knees! You’ll know when

at what you can achieve in the water; most Bambinos are much better swimmers than they allow themselves to believe! The Bambino: more confidence and a better ‘feel for the water’ is required! --- Page 318 Text --- 1. Develop your exhalation technique by using the Sink Down and Breathe - Bubble - Bubble - Breathe exercises listed in Appendix A. This is critical for your stroke because a build-up of CO in your system will make swimming feel much 2 more tense than it needs to be. Exhale smoothly into the water with a relaxed sigh – If you have ever done any yoga you will understand how powerful this can be for your relaxation. As you start swimming use the breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe mantra to help coordinate bilateral breathing and exhalation together. Do not worry if the breath itself still feels a struggle, we will come to that later. 2. Tune up your kicking technique using the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick and Swim Back exercises. A relaxed flutter kick that comes from the hip (not the knee) will burn less oxygen and bring your legs up higher in the water, creating less drag. You’re not looking to kick hard in your swimming so make sure that your kick is just light enough to bring your legs up so that your ankles break the surface. 3. Tune in to good stroke timing using the Kick On Side and then 6-1-6 drills. These may feel quite strange and hard to coordinate at first but that’s OK. A weak point in a Bambino’s stroke is that their lead arm slips down in the water when breathing, when in fact it should be out in front of the head offering support. As you perform the 6-1-6 drill you may find that the

coordinate at first but that’s OK. A weak point in a Bambino’s stroke is that their lead arm slips down in the water when breathing, when in fact it should be out in front of the head offering support. As you perform the 6-1-6 drill you may find that the lead arm wants to collapse down as the top arm comes over during the arm stroke. If this happens practise using a Vitamin tube as a relay baton, as described in Appendix A. Move on to 6-3-6, all the time catching up for the moment with your arms in front of your head. You should immediately notice more support when breathing. Developing a good exhalation technique is critical to helping you relax in the water. 4. Reinforce your stroke timing by repeating the 1-2-stretch mantra to yourself as you swim. The 1 and 2 being on normal strokes and the stretch on a breathing stroke, this will help to remind you to keep that lead hand out in front of you for support whilst breathing. You should be able to let your breath take care of itself whilst you think about keeping that lead hand stable. --- Page 319 Text --- 5. Work on your head position whilst breathing using the Popeye Breathing and Split Screen visualisation described in Chapter 7. You are aiming to keep your head low in the water and breathe into the bow-wave trough. If you have tried this before it will be much more achievable now that we have improved your stroke timing in steps 3 and 4. 6. Develop a basic ‘feel for the water’ using the Scull #1 drill. You may well find sculling quite a challenging exercise at first but that’s OK, this is highlighting a bit of a hole in your

sense of rhythm will benefit your stroke. Kicktastic Stroke Correction Process If you are a Kicktastic, use the following process to develop your swimming. The main feature is in step 4 where we develop your catch and ‘feel for the water’. As you make the shift to upper-body propulsion you should find that the reliance on your leg kick naturally starts to drop away. 1. Tune up your exhalation technique using the Sink Down and Breathe - Bubble - Bubble - Breathe exercises in Appendix A. Despite being quite experienced swimmers, many Kicktastics hold their breath under the water, which makes swimming much harder than it needs to be. Developing your ability to breathe out smoothly into the water will make swimming feel easier and give you more time when you do go to take a breath as you will only have to inhale, not exhale and inhale in the same short window! Many Kicktastics returning to swimming after years off from the sport feel that they never regain their swimming fitness. However, this can simply be due to poor exhalation technique and essentially turning what should be a very aerobic activity into something much more anaerobic by never releasing the build-up of CO in their system. 2 --- Page 320 Text --- The Kicktastic: a better catch and ‘feel for the water’ will allow them to moderate their kick. 2. Give your kicking technique a once over using the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick and Swim Back exercises. Despite having powerful leg kicks, many Kicktastics kick hard from the knee rather than kicking with a relatively straight leg from the hip. Developing an improved kicking technique will reduce the oxygen demand from the kick, making breathing much easier. 3. Work on improving posture and rotation using the Kick

Despite having powerful leg kicks, many Kicktastics kick hard from the knee rather than kicking with a relatively straight leg from the hip. Developing an improved kicking technique will reduce the oxygen demand from the kick, making breathing much easier. 3. Work on improving posture and rotation using the Kick On Side and then 6-1- 6 and 6-3-6 drills. Poor body rotation is a feature of the Kicktastic’s stroke and is often accompanied by a crossover in front of the head. Many other Swim Types would experience a scissor kick as a result of the crossover but Kicktastics normally do not as the strong 6-beat kick smothers this tendency. However, the crossover is still very damaging for a swimmer’s catch, which requires good alignment into the water. These drills will also improve a Kicktastic’s swimming posture, which is often quite poor and results in them swimming quite flat in the water (see Chapter 11). As you perform the side-kicking exercises work on opening up your chest and drawing your shoulder blades together and back. This will help drive body rotation and set up for a propulsive arm stroke. 4. Develop your catch mechanics using the Scull #1 and Doggy Paddle drills. As a Kicktastic you can expect these drills to feel quite alien and challenging at first, which simply highlights the catch as a weak point in your stroke. Perform the drills using a pull buoy and resist the temptation to add a little kick to the drill – that is very much cheating! Perform Scull #1 first, focusing on developing a good catch position with the elbows higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips. Once you are beginning to feel the water on the palms of your hands, move on and try Doggy --- Page

investment in your swimming, especially if you train outside of a squad. Use it to control and monitor your stroke rate as you continue to refine your catch technique and stroke timing. 8. Experiment with a light 6-beat flutter kick if you do not use one already. Although a 2-beat kick uses less energy it naturally suits a shorter faster stroke style, not a long smooth one. Depending on your natural buoyancy you may find that your body position is higher in the water with a light 6-beat flutter kick. This will create less drag and lower your energy expenditure overall despite the extra kicking. Swinger Stroke Correction Process If you are a Swinger follow the process outlined below and refer to the relevant sections of this book to develop your swimming. 1. Brush up on your exhalation technique into the water using the Sink Down and Breathe - Bubble - Bubble - Breathe exercises listed in Appendix A. Despite being experienced swimmers, Swingers are some of the worst culprits when it comes to holding their breath underwater. It’s possible that their fast stroke rate lets them get away with this more than other types since their breathing comes around quicker. However, by improving your breathing technique you’ll feel much more relaxed in the water and might be able to move to breathing every five strokes rather than three. Breathing less often is always an advantage as all swimmers lose stroke efficiency when breathing. The Swinger: experienced swimmer with excellent stroke rhythm who needs a tune-up. --- Page 326 Text --- 2. Work on improving posture and alignment in the water using the Kick On Side and then 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills. After many years of swimming, Swingers often slip into a few bad habits and start to cross over

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
these changes may well have subtly altered the timing of your stroke, which may feel strange at first. To help synchronise these changes to your body rotation use the Unco drill, focusing on the mantra Stroke And Dip as you do so. Feel how your body rotation drives the stroke, and, when you start swimming, feel that easy rhythm to your stroke. As discussed above, you may end up at a slightly lower stroke rate than you are used to. That is fine if it means better alignment and propulsion in your stroke as you will be swimming quicker overall. 6. Optional: formalise your 2-beat kick using the process below. This is an advanced skill and is only suitable for Swingers whose strokes are becoming quite refined. A 2-beat kick only really suits swimmers with fast stroke rates – those with a slower stroke rate are normally much more suited to a light 6-beat flutter kick. Kick on your front with fins on and both arms down by your side. Use a deep vertical scissoring of the legs to kick – we are looking for large movements switching between the two positions: left leg up + right leg down and right leg up + left leg down. As you kick down with one leg, dip the opposite shoulder into the water. --- Page 328 Text --- As you kick notice how the opposite shoulder naturally dips into the water. Continue this for at least 50 m, becoming used to the sensation, making it feel quite snappy through the hips and core. Keep the fins on and move to a lap of freestyle only breathing to the left. As your right hand enters into the water, roll and breathe to the left and simultaneously try the big deep kick down with

sensation, making it feel quite snappy through the hips and core. Keep the fins on and move to a lap of freestyle only breathing to the left. As your right hand enters into the water, roll and breathe to the left and simultaneously try the big deep kick down with the left leg. Make this a very positive movement each time the right hand enters into the water. Repeat the exercise but this time breathing to the right and kicking down with the right leg as the left hand enters into the water. You are unlikely to be able to think about both sides simultaneously as you swim so just focus on one side and simply mirror the other side of your stroke. Progress to swimming using bilateral breathing, timing the leg kick against your hand entry as described. A 2-beat kick looks easy but is an advanced-level skill. Always practise using fins at first and using big exaggerated movements. Once you feel accustomed to the timing of the kick try integrating it into your normal swimming without using fins and with a much more compact and tidy kicking amplitude. Smooth Stroke Correction Process In contrast to the other Swim Type processes, which work on specific weaknesses, these steps are really an all-round once-over on your stroke. As a Smooth there won’t be too much amiss but you will notice the benefits from tuning up a few areas of your stroke that have slipped a little. 1. Give your exhalation technique a tune-up using the Sink Down exercise in Appendix A. Despite your experience as a swimmer, the chances are that your exhalation is not what it could be. This won’t be hard for you to improve but you will need to constantly remind yourself to exhale smoothly and efficiently

technique a tune-up using the Sink Down exercise in Appendix A. Despite your experience as a swimmer, the chances are that your exhalation is not what it could be. This won’t be hard for you to improve but you will need to constantly remind yourself to exhale smoothly and efficiently into the water whilst you develop the habit. The Smooth: the envy of the pool but may need to adapt their stroke for high- performance in open water. --- Page 329 Text --- 2. Give your posture and alignment in the water a once-over using the Kick On Side and then 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills. As a Smooth this should be a strong area of yours but it is worth becoming aware of the importance of good posture in swimming. As we all get older we lose our natural flexibility so a little on-going maintenance in this area is well advised. If you have only been breathing to one side (see Chapter 7 and steps 4 and 5 below) then this is going to be important to you as you might have become a little lopsided in your stroke from doing so. Pay particular attention to your catch set-up position here using a slightly cocked wrist set-up with the fingertips lower than the wrist. This will help you initiate the catch effectively and help you to develop your ‘feel for the water’. 3. Revisit your catch mechanics using the Scull #1 and Doggy Paddle drills. You are probably familiar with these or similar exercises from your youth but might not have tried them in a while or focused on the right areas when doing so. We are looking to reignite your ‘feel for the water’, which will have already been assisted by an improved catch set-up from step 2. If

these or similar exercises from your youth but might not have tried them in a while or focused on the right areas when doing so. We are looking to reignite your ‘feel for the water’, which will have already been assisted by an improved catch set-up from step 2. If you feel like your catch is not what it once was then pay attention to bending your elbow early in front of your head – both drills will assist you in doing so. 4. Introduce bilateral breathing if you are not already breathing to both sides regularly. With a good exhalation technique into the water and no hint of overgliding in your stroke you will find breathing every three strokes straightforward for the majority of your training. Bilateral breathing helps you to balance out your stroke and gives you practice at breathing to both sides – an important tactical consideration for racing well in the open water. 5. Check your breathing timing by visualising turning your head away from your arm as it enters the water and extends forwards on a breathing stroke. Turn your head smoothly away so that you never get a glimpse of it entering the water and --- Page 330 Text --- you will find that you have more time to inhale, which will make things feel much more relaxed. Late breathing is shown on the top sequence: the body rotates between (1) and (2) and then the head lifts to breathe (3). Correct timing is shown on the bottom row. The head rotates to breathe in time with the extension of the arm forwards. 6. Rhythm and timing is an important component of any great freestyle stroke and after steps 1–5 it is time to revisit it in your stroke. Use the Unco drill to

Sport of Swimming than resolutely resisting you in the way that a solid does. Similarly, speed in swim- ming comes not necessarily from moving your body parts faster but from using your movements to put pressure on the water in an effective manner. As anyone who has participated in water aerobics can attest, you can work awfully hard in the water yet go nowhere. Swimming also changes the priorities typically placed on the human senses, as well as the feedback they provide. On land, much of our typical interaction with our environment revolves around the senses of sight and hearing. Underwater, however, both of these senses are diminished and therefore often take a backseat to the sense of touch, or “feel.” Of course, one component of this sensory feedback involves water temperature, which can greatly affect one’s comfort and enjoyment when swimming. In addition, both very cold water and very hot water both pose health risks. Specifically, water temperatures below 72 degrees Fahrenheit (about 22 degrees Celsius) or above 92 degrees Fahrenheit (about 33 degrees Celsius) require special caution because they make for an uncomfortable learning environment. Last—and this is perhaps the most striking difference between swimming and other sports—one must purposefully address the question of when (and where) to breathe. In most other sports, breathing happens without much conscious thought. In swimming, however, breathing is often a primary focus because inhaling water is not a pleasant experience. As a result, many swimmers feel that they must take a big gulp of air and then hold their breath for as long as they can while swimming. This approach typically leads to a bad experience, such as hyperventilating or even concluding that swimming is just too hard and giving up altogether. Each of these defining characteristics of swimming is discussed in

water (figure 1.4). You can try this first exercise while holding your breath. One indicator of success is being able to look straight down at the bottom of the pool while relaxing on the water in a horizontal position with your back straight. After you become comforta- ble in this position, try it again—only this time breathe out slowly. Breath holding causes tension, which can lead a swimmer to sink or struggle with balance; exhaling slowly, on the other hand, aids relaxation and is also a necessary skill for performing the competitive strokes. To control your breathing, rather than exhaling forcefully, breathe out through your nose while humming. 8 --- Page 28 Text --- Floating Figure 1.4 FronT FloaTing WiTh arms exTended Preparation Execution 1.

Kicking Drill 1 Fingertip Pressure Move about a yard (m) away from the wall, then establish a neutral buoyant posi- tion on your front by lying on the water in the streamlined position described in step 1. Using only your kicking skill, kick toward the wall with your hands stretched out so that your fingertips touch the wall first. Once your fingers have touched the wall, continue kicking so that you feel pressure on your fingertips. This pressure indicates that you have developed a propulsive kick and can purposefully manipulate the water using your legs.

Boardless Kicking Drill 2 underwater Kicking Once you have mastered flutter kicking on both your back and your front on the surface of the water, it is time to fine-tune your kick for maximum benefit. In previous parts of this progression, you have learned how to apply pressure to the water with your legs, feet, and toes. The instructions have emphasized kicking in a specific direction, but the most effective and efficient swimmers can manipulate the water by applying pressure with both the tops and the bottoms of their legs and feet. 36 --- Page 56 Text --- Manipulating the Water The next part of developing this ability involves kicking on a streamline under the water. Remember that at no point should you engage in extended breath holding! Remember also to exhale slowly. As described in step 1, put both feet on the wall and assume a position in which your head, knees, and toes are up. Release the hand from the wall, touch your hands together under the water, and push off in a streamlined position while keeping your head down.

on his name despite being characterized as un-European barbaric thrashing. Around the turn of the century in Australia, a similar stroke was used with a flutter kick by a Solomon Islander named Alick Wickham. That version was devel- oped further by coach Richmond “Dick” Cavill into what we now recognize as some- thing closer to freestyle, which was referred to as the Australian crawl. In the modern era, coaches added a six-beat (i.e., six kicks per one arm stroke) kick, and the stroke became the front crawl, which later came to be referred to simply as freestyle. Tech- nically speaking, freestyle races can be swum using any stroke, but the crawl stroke is the fastest of the competitive strokes and therefore has become synonymous with freestyle. The Three rs Good freestyle depends on the three Rs: reach, rotation, and relaxation. Reach is dis- cussed with the catch and pull. Rotation involves turning the body over by rotating around the anchor point—the hand. It is crucial to ensure that your hip and shoulder stay in the same plane. Relaxation involves learning to relax the body parts that are not helping you swim more efficiently. Good freestyle is efficient and effective. Swimmers who master freestyle find it is as easy as walking. To that end, this step helps you develop the following skills: • Horizontal body line • Rotation on a long axis • High elbow catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Kicking rhythm • Effective breathing • Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective freestyle stroke. 51 --- Page 71 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success One key element of effective freestyle is maintaining a good horizontal position on the water.

BreaThing As land-based creatures, we cannot process oxygen out of water as fish do; therefore, we must find a way to breathe air while swimming. In freestyle, this need is met by rotating the head so that the mouth and nose are out of the water at a good time during the stroke cycle (figure 3.4), thus allowing the swimmer to breathe without interrupting his or her rhythm. The best way to do so is to rotate the face out of the water as an arm is finishing a stroke at the thigh and beginning the recovery. The rotation is initiated at the shoulder and hip, and the head follows. This technique is less about rotating the neck and more about proper positioning. There is a bow wave with the forward propulsion that allows for a

is finishing a stroke at the thigh and beginning the recovery. The rotation is initiated at the shoulder and hip, and the head follows. This technique is less about rotating the neck and more about proper positioning. There is a bow wave with the forward propulsion that allows for a trough to be pro- duced; the depth and utility of that differ from swimmer to swimmer. A bow wave in the world of fluid mechanics is a wave that is produced by the vector displacement of water by another object. The size of the crest and trough produced depends on the mass, velocity, and displacement buoyancy of the object. As the body moves through the water, the crown of the head will cause the water in front of it to increase in pressure as the head moves forward. The water will seek equilibrium from this high pressure state by moving to a lower pressure. Due to the incompressibility of water, the water molecules “choose” a direction to go with some moving down and others moving up or to the side with and infinite number of vector possibilities. The rising part is offset by a falling part producing both a crest and a trough which is below the waterline and will be helpful when trying to rotate the mouth and nose toward the air to breathe. The objective here is to get your air as quickly as possible so that you can get your face back in the water before your hand finishes the recovery, thus readying you for the next catch. 62 --- Page 82 Text --- Freestyle Figure 3.4 single-sTrOke BreaThing Preparation 1.

While stroking with your arms, slowly exhale until you have expelled much of the air from your lungs. 2. As you finish your next stroke, rotate your body and face so that your face is out of the water, then breathe in and stop. b At this point, you should be on your side or back with one arm at your side and the other arm above your head, in front of your shoulder. Practice this sequence several times. Most people prefer one side or the other for rotation, so multiple repeats are helpful to identify which side is preferred. Then move on to continuous breathing (figure 3.5). 63 --- Page 83 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 3.5 cOnTinUOUs BreaThing Preparation 1.

MissTep Your hips sink when you go to breathe. cOrrecTiOn Make sure that you are looking to the side of the pool rather than lift- ing your head to look forward. 64 --- Page 84 Text --- Freestyle Drills FOr BreaThing Breathing is more about timing than about anything else. Swimming is one of only a few sports in which your breathing is a life-and-death decision. When running or partici- pating in other sports, your respiration is not really something you have to consciously think about when participating. Swimming on the other had is different. Inhaling with your face in the water will produce some unwanted consequences, including death. This factor is particularly important for new swimmers. As you progress through the skills, you may find yourself holding your breath, which is a mistake. Make sure to exhale slowly and inhale rhythmically rather than gulping at the air. Breathing Drill 1 One-arm The one-arm freestyle drill comes in several versions. One of the most effective approaches is to stroke with only one arm down the length of the pool with the other arm at your side. On every stroke, breathe to the nonstroking side and be sure to rotate to the stroking side. The timing of this drill is crucial. It must be done slowly, and the shoulder of the stroking arm should be touching your ear when you breathe. In addition, your stroking arm should be fully extended until your face is back in the water to initiate the catch.

stroking side. The timing of this drill is crucial. It must be done slowly, and the shoulder of the stroking arm should be touching your ear when you breathe. In addition, your stroking arm should be fully extended until your face is back in the water to initiate the catch. Repeat the process by switching arms. Breathing on both sides is a great skill to master, but many swimmers prefer one side or the other. Forty years ago, coaches advocated that one needed to learn to breathe on both sides in order to be a good swimmer. Enter Grant Hackett, multiple world-record holder and Olympic champion, who breathed exclusively on the right side. Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, does the same thing. In addition, forcing the issue of breathing on both sides detracts from the needed focus on your propulsive movements. The breathing question can be addressed (if at all) once you progress far enough to work with a swim coach. TO increase DiFFicUlTy • Perform six kicks per stroke. TO Decrease DiFFicUlTy • Use fins to prevent that stalling feeling and isolate the catch and pull, as well as the timing of your breathing.

It is not designed to have swimmers hold their breath. The numbers (3, 5, 3, 7) indicate how many strokes you should take between breaths per 25 yards. In other words, for the first 25 yards, breathe every three strokes; for the second 25, breathe every five strokes, and so on. This drill is challenging even when done slowly and with effective movements, and the odd numbers cause an alternating of the breathing pattern. This alternat- ing pattern is a great skill to have, especially for racers, triathletes, and open-water swimmers. It helps with having a faster breathing rate at higher workload levels, and it can aid in navigation for open-water swimmers.

Although you start by kicking with a kickboard, you incorporate rotation when breathing. When done correctly, kicking not only provides propulsive force but also assists with balance. The flutter kick, in particular, uses an alternating leg movement, and the whole leg is moved both up and down to put pressure on the water both on the down stroke of the kick and on the upstroke. Many novice swimmers have difficulty with this skill because their legs are too rigid and produce no propulsive power. When done properly, the kick’s power comes from the hip, and the strong muscles of the lower core are actively engaged. The rest of the leg is kept long and loose, and you are encouraged to think of the knee joint and ankle joint of each leg as being connected by a rubber band. In this way, the kick is more likely to be long and fluid rather than stiff and mechanical. It is okay to point your toes slightly, but pointing too aggressively (rather than using your ankle’s natural flexion) can lead to a rigid and unproductive kick. An unproductive kick can also be caused by having your foot out of the water. Remem- ber, the goal is to exert pressure

It is okay to point your toes slightly, but pointing too aggressively (rather than using your ankle’s natural flexion) can lead to a rigid and unproductive kick. An unproductive kick can also be caused by having your foot out of the water. Remem- ber, the goal is to exert pressure on the water; generally, therefore, only your heel should break the surface. MissTep Your kick is rigid and not propulsive. cOrrecTiOn Narrow your kick and speed it up just a bit. Remember that a splash indicates simply that the water is absorbing your energy. Think of trying to kick with your feet inside of a bucket or a basketball hoop. Rather than pointing your toes, think about curling them and keeping you knees and ankles “floppy” or loose. 67 --- Page 87 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success MissTep You go nowhere or even backward when kicking. cOrrecTiOn Check your feet and ankles. Are they pointed and rigid? Are they dorsiflexed (in an L shape)? Keep the lower part of your legs loose and your feet slightly pointed. Keeping your legs long, with little knee flexion, prevents “bicycling” or pushing at the water. Remember that the kick should come from the hip. Drills FOr kicking Kicking is critical to taking pressure off of your shoulders and engaging your core in the swimming motions. The following drills help you to practice your propulsive kick. Kicking Drill 1 kickboard This is a good drill for developing flutter-kick basics. To do it, grab the kickboard at the bottom and extend your arms. Push off of the wall and begin flutter-kicking on your front with your face in the water. Exhale slowly and drop one arm to your side while rotating. This drill is also a good way to practice your breathing; make sure

the kickboard at the bottom and extend your arms. Push off of the wall and begin flutter-kicking on your front with your face in the water. Exhale slowly and drop one arm to your side while rotating. This drill is also a good way to practice your breathing; make sure to turn your hip over and catch a quick breath to the side. Recover your hand over the water as usual. At this point, you may feel your hips sink. This is a problem because it disturbs the line of travel and impedes efficiency. Experiment with the amplitude, size, and frequency of your kicks to keep the hips up. TO increase DiFFicUlTy • Place one hand on the kickboard and kick on your side (right side for 25 yards and left side for 25 yards). • Eliminate the kickboard and kick in a streamlined position. • Kick underwater in a streamlined position. TO Decrease DiFFicUlTy • Use fins to prevent that stalling feeling and avoid rushing the drill. • Rest your upper arms across the kickboard by gripping the top to keep your face out of the water.

The object is to sink under- water, achieve a streamlined position, and push off of the wall forcefully. Then start kicking as fast as you can in order to go as far as you can underwater, keeping in mind that of course you will need to come up for air. Remember that your body posi- tion dictates your depth; if your head is down you will stay down, but the moment you lift your head you will rise to the surface. Repeat this drill several times to increase your distance traveled from the wall. Exhale in a slow, controlled fashion throughout the movement.

modern backstroke led to several technique changes, as well as revised notions of how to swim the stroke most effectively. The original back- stroke was performed with the arms straight underwater and somewhat loose on the over- the-water recovery, almost as if it were the front crawl or freestyle turned upside down. Later, Australian swimmers used a bent-arm pull and developed a stroke closer to what is recognized as backstroke today. The great advantage of backstroke over other strokes is that the swimmer’s face is out of the water. In addition, swimmers who master the backstroke develop great balance on the water, which also benefits their freestyle stroke. In this step, you will develop the following skills: • Horizontal body line • Rotation on a long axis • Splashless entry and effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Kicking rhythm • Effective breathing • Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective backstroke. A good horizontal position is a key element of an effective backstroke and also lays the foundation for applying force to the water to achieve propulsion. As mastered in step 1 (floating on your back), the basic position involves lying on the water with your head, hips, feet, and hands at the surface. As you remain stretched out on the water, ensure that you are comfortable and balanced. Basic BacksTroke A good armstroke for the backstroke (figure 4.1) consists of four basic elements that provide the bulk of the propulsive force in swimming: catch, pull, finish (with your palm toward your body, not toward the bottom of the pool), and recovery. At some point when the strok- ing arm is near vertical, rotate your hand so that your pinkie finger leads the

If you rotated over—as in the spine being an axis and the arc of rotation includes the hip and shoulder together in the same plane at a fixed distance—your hand and thigh should be at or above the water’s surface.

• You finish the stroke with your palm on your thigh rather than toward the pool bottom. 87 --- Page 107 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success BreaTHing Although your face is out of the water in the backstroke, you should practice a few techniques for effective breathing as you put your backstroke together. Many swim- mers find it effective to breathe in through the mouth and exhale through the nose. This way, if water is drawn toward your face and falls into your mouth, you can expel or swallow it, which most people find preferable to inhaling it through the nose. In addition, the technique helps many swimmers with control, rhythm, and timing. Since swimming is a rhythmic motion, synchronizing all of the motions of the body including breathing makes for good swimming. Most people can establish a good breathing rhythm after just a little practice. Complete the following to practice backstroke breathing. PreParation 1. Push off of the wall and begin your armstrokes. execution 1. While stroking with your arms, practice exhaling when one arm is pulling and inhaling when the other arm is pulling. MissTep You swallow a bunch of water when trying to breathe. correcTion Are you flat or rotating? Rotate each time, with your recovering side out of the water. MissTep Your hips sink every time you breathe. correcTion Are your hands stopping and meeting at your hips? A good oppo- site-hands rhythm prevents a lot of the stalling encountered by many swimmers. Drill For BreaTHing As with many things requiring a physical effort, swimming is no different, and although your face is out of the water and breathing timing seems less important backstroke breathing is still a skill that should be mastered. 88 --- Page 108 Text --- Backstroke Backstroke Breathing Drill Backstroke Breathing

BreaTHing As with many things requiring a physical effort, swimming is no different, and although your face is out of the water and breathing timing seems less important backstroke breathing is still a skill that should be mastered. 88 --- Page 108 Text --- Backstroke Backstroke Breathing Drill Backstroke Breathing pattern Most backstroke swimmers inhale on one armstroke and exhale on the next. They also inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose. If you have ever gotten water up your nose while swimming the backstroke, you know that it is not a pleasant experience. Make sure that you have the breathing pattern down by following these instructions. Ensure that the lane is clear. Ensure that backstroke flags are in place. Push off in the streamlined position. As you break the surface, exhale through your nose. Choose which arm is your inhale arm and which is your exhale arm. Start slowly and breathe in through your mouth on one armstroke and out through your nose on the opposite armstroke. Experiment to find out which pattern works best for you. Increase your effort and velocity while maintaining control. To increase DiFFiculTy • Perform six kicks per stroke.

The kick used for the backstroke is the flutter kick (figure 4.4). It fea- tures alternating leg movement, and the whole leg is moved up and down to put pressure on the water both on the downstroke and on the upstroke. This kick is generally the same one used in freestyle swimming but with a few minor points of difference. As in freestyle, think of each leg’s knee joint and ankle joint as being connected by a rubber band. In this way, the kick is more likely to be long and fluid rather than stiff and mechanical. In another pitfall, many swimmers tend to “paw” at the water by emphasizing the downkick and neglecting the upkick or by raising the leg too high out of the water. Figure 4.4 BacksTroke kicking Preparation 1. Make sure that the lane is clear and the backstroke flags are in place. Execution 1. Lie on the water in the neutral a position. 2.

As you can tell from the previous sections, this step involves a number of components; as a result, you need not get frustrated if you don’t get it right on the first try. Generally, the fastest backstroke swimming happens with six kicks per armstroke, in which case you are moving the lower part of your body much faster than the upper part. Try this progression to maximize your chance for success (figure 4.5). Figure 4.5 BacksTroke TiMing anD rHyTHM Preparation 1.

mimicking the motions of a frog, though the modern version differs somewhat in terms of the kick. In any case, it can be traced back at least to the Stone Age, when cave paintings were made in what is now western Egypt to depict people using the stroke. The breaststroke was also the only stroke used for the first recorded crossing of the Eng- lish Channel by a swimmer. There are several advantages: It is possible to breathe after every stroke, see where you are going, and use the stroke for survival and safety once you know how to do this stroke effectively. Though it is technically the slowest of the four competi- tive strokes, its subtleties and nuances make it arguably the most complex as well. Though everyone can learn to do the breaststroke—and should, since a slower vari- ant of it is essential in swimming long distances when necessary—learning to swim it fast takes a great deal of patience and time. Breaststroke and butterfly are considered “short-axis” strokes but are really tim- ing-and-rhythm strokes. Granted, you do rotate on a shorter axis (i.e., through the chest, laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes: • Good body position • Effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Kicking rhythm • Effective breathing • Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these components, you are well on your way to an effective breaststroke. The breaststroke is the only one of the four competitive strokes that derives its propulsive force equally from the pull and the kick; therefore, you should give equal attention to both elements. This double focus is one factor that makes the

BreaThinG One of the many advantages of the breaststroke is that you can breathe on every stroke. The exact timing of this breath is an important part of the rhythm of the breast- stroke (figure 5.3). As a result, before you start to put it all together for a complete breaststroke, it is a good idea to practice your breathing in isolation. While perform- ing the following drills, lift your head to breathe; the key is to do so at the right time and in the right manner. With the other pressures of laminar flow of water against the chest providing lift on the water, this movement should be sufficient to get your mouth and nose out of the water. Some swimmers will be higher and others lower; it is very specific to each swimmer. 107 --- Page 127 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 5.3 BreasTsTroke BreaThinG Preparation 1. Lie on

Instead of lifting your head per se, use the outsweep to generate lift so that all you need is a simple forward push of your chin. 3. Breathe out while your face is in the water. b MissTep You breathe too late and your hand stops under your chin. correcTion Think about trying to quickly touch your elbows together under your chest.

The following drills will help you establish a good head position and help with breathing. Breathing Drill Tennis Ball 2 This drill helps you maintain proper head position while going to get air or breathing in breaststroke. To perform the drill, place a tennis ball beneath your chin and hold it to your chest. This action keeps your neck in line and prevents you from coming up too high when you breathe. Swim the regular breaststroke and try breathing both earlier in the stroke and later in the stroke to find out which works best for you. Avoid pushing down on the water with your palms.

It was developed in the 1930s as a way to minimize the drag caused by underwater recovery of the arms in the breaststroke. Early variants of the butterfly (referred to as the butterfly breaststroke) used an over-the-water recovery with a breaststroke kick. This technique was much faster than the breaststroke but required a great deal of strength. It was not until the 1950s that the butterfly was con- sidered a separate stroke from breaststroke, and the use of a dolphin kick was added to the official competition rules governing the new stroke. As mentioned in step 5, the butterfly, like the breaststroke, is considered a “short- axis” stroke but is really a timing-and-rhythm stroke. It does involve rotating on a shorter axis (i.e., through the chest, laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes: • Good body position • Effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Acceleration throughout the stroke •

laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes: • Good body position • Effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Acceleration throughout the stroke • Kicking rhythm • Effective breathing • Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective butterfly. The basic motion of the butterfly involves an undulating rhythm in which the legs and arms are synchronized by precise timing. The most important element of a good butterfly stroke is the use of the body’s core, which is the greatest source of power. Here are the basic movements as you flow through the stroke. From the neutral position described in step 1—facedown in the water with your arms stretched out above your head—press your chest down toward the pool bottom. To help you do so, you can use a downward motion of your feet with your legs together in a dol- phin-kick downstroke. Next, push your hips down while arching your back to bring your head and chest back toward the surface. Again, you are encouraged to use your legs in a dol- phin-kick upstroke; you should feel some pressure on the backs of your legs and the bottoms of your feet. You use the dolphin kick here both to provide propulsive force and to manipulate the position of your center of buoyancy to produce an undulating motion. 115 --- Page 135 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success As you complete the undulating and kicking motion, pitch your fingers down toward the bottom of the pool and bend at the elbows in a motion similar to that of pushing yourself up out of

### Swimming STEPS TO SUCCESS_full_text.txt
cage down through your pelvis. In addi- tion, your legs stay together the whole time. The basic motion involves driving your hips back and forth with the strong muscles of your core and using your legs merely to finish off the kick. Your legs should be long and loose; let your strong core muscles initiate most of the work. A good mental image for this kick is the motion of a dolphin or whale. Try to mimic that motion with your body, from your chest on down. Some swimmers also find it helpful to imagine that their legs are glued together and cannot be separated. In this step, you will work on the following skills: 1. Developing a propulsive and symmetrical kick 2. Laying your hands on the water and achieving a good catch position 3. Getting from the catch to the pull and making sure that the force is applied in the correct direction 4. Accelerating your hands through the pull 5. Synchronizing the kick and the pull 6. Effective breathing 7. Recovery of the arms Dolphin Kick With Face Out of Water The key here is to sustain a steady rhythmic kick (don’t think about speed just yet) that feels like you are putting pressure on the water all the way down your leg. Remember to start the kick with your core and move fluidly down through your legs. Once you have mastered this motion (figure 6.1), it is time to move on to the next part of the progression. 116 --- Page 136 Text --- Butterfly Figure 6.1 Dolphin KicK WiTh Face ouT oF WaTer Preparation 1.

you perform all elements of the stroke, except that when you finish the stroke you sweep your hands and arms forward and out to the sides, near the surface of the water but still in it. Start with your hands and arms extended out front and lie on the water in the neutral position. Do a dolphin kick, both up and down, as well as a catch and pull. As you finish the pull, sweep your hands and arms out in a semicircular motion with your arms straight. It is okay for your arms to skim the surface of the water. When your hands reach the front, stop and stand up to reset the stroke. When performing this drill, keep your arms straight and lead with your thumbs while in the water. This technique helps with body positioning so you do not get the body too vertical. To increase DiFFiculTY • Once you are comfortable with this drill, add one dolphin kick prior to moving your hands back and another one after finishing the pull at your thighs. • Breathe by sculling in the front rather than stopping and touching the bottom.

BreaThing The timing of the breath is critical to a good butterfly stroke. As with the breast- stroke, breathing at the wrong time during the butterfly stroke cycle not only slows the stroke but also increases the rate of fatigue. However, whereas mistimed breath- ing in the breaststroke mainly makes you slow, mistimed breathing in the butterfly exhausts you and forces you to stop. 130 --- Page 150 Text --- Butterfly To learn when to breathe and how to do so with proper technique, you use a few simple mental cues and drills (figure 6.8). The first cue addresses how high to rise out of the water when getting air. Rising too high reduces momentum and undulation. As a corrective, think of pushing your chin forward rather than lifting your head. The next concern is the timing of your breathing. Many swimmers breathe late. To avoid this pitfall, initiate the forward chin movement as you start your pull and make it a quick breath. How often you breathe depends on your individual needs and development as a swimmer. Conventional wisdom used to recommend breath- ing on every other stroke and leaving your face in the water rather than getting air on each stroke. However, after several Olympians chose to breathe either on every stroke or in a one-two pattern, it became apparent that butterfly swimmers should breathe as often as they need to—but not more.

Lay your hands on the water directly in front of you so that your arms are above the head in an outstretched position like that of Superman when flying. Perform four dolphin kicks to continue moving forward while adjusting your hands and arms if necessary. If you find yourself having to lift your head and pitch your hands up to get back to the stretched-out position, you are driving the stroke too much with your upper body.
