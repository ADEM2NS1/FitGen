After all, we use our bodies from head to toe to perform our sport. The complex system of muscles that weaves together over our frames allows us to do the quick, explosive movements, and the long, repetitious movements that make up swimming. Our muscles work in tandem to make it possible to perform tasks as simple as putting on goggles and as lofty as winning Olympic gold. Yet, when we see a fantastic swimmer moving through the water with grace and speed, we don’t associate their speed with muscular strength. Instead we associate it

lower body rests, and on the lower body work day, the upper body rests. Building in variation in training also keeps a swimmer sharp, both mentally and physically. A creatively designed program uses a diverse array of exercises to meet each training objective. For instance, if the objective is explosiveness, a swimmer could be given leaps for height, 15-yard running sprints, or a speed jump rope activity. If the objective is core stability, a swimmer could be given a two-minute plank, a series of “V” ups, or some “left rights” with a medicine ball. If the objective is power, a swimmer could be given fifteen minutes of rowing, some stretch cord work, or as many dips as they can do in a minute. This sort of variation in training adds interest and can boost a swimmer’s coordination, as he or she is required to accomplish new and different actions with the same muscles groups. The crucial point is that every exercise that is added to the mix must bring the swimmer closer to the objective. 25 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 25 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 28 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Variation also makes things fun. Swimmers spend a lot of time with their faces in the water, alone with their thoughts, looking at the black line on the bottom of the pool. A good variety of land-based strength training gives swimmers the opportunity to socialize while they train, laugh together as they observe each other’s initially awkward efforts, and motivate each other as they master the coordination of a new exercise. OVER-TRAINING In general, swimmers have a great work ethic. The combination of mental toughness and a highly developed fitness level enables them to keep working when they are tired. While, in many ways, this is an admirable

start focusing on perfecting form that will carry through to later stages of development. Such work can be done three to four days a week in sessions of about 20 minutes. ADOLESCENCE During adolescence, athletes go through a time of continuous change that includes physical maturing and weight gain. As they go through puberty, athletes experience periods of rapid strength gain alternating with periods where strength lags behind their growth. At times, their physical changes are accompanied by awkwardness and self- consciousness. At other times, they are accompanied by bravado and testing of their new characteristics. The objective at this stage of development is building power, force, stability, and coordination. When well supervised, swimmers can make important progress during this time, with gains in applicable strength. Sessions of 30 minutes or more, five days a week should include self-resistance work, medicine balls and some stretch bands, accompanied by clearly stated objectives. This combination of training can encourage swimmers to focus on achieving great improvements in swimming speed. YOUNG ADULT At this stage, the athlete has adult physical characteristics and size. This is a period when the athlete is at the peak of strength and performance potential. With a solid foundation of athleticism, swimming and strength work, the now fully mature swimmer can make huge and continuing gains in speed with dedication to a solid training routine and a healthy lifestyle. 54 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 54 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 57 Text --- Stages of Development The objective at this stage is maximizing force, power, and explosiveness.

is maximizing force, power, and explosiveness. A strength program that encompasses weight training, stretch bands, medicine balls and self-resistance can encourage development of maximum strength by the athlete’s adult body that can be applied to swimming faster than ever before. A program of strength work four days a week for an hour can net the force, power, explosiveness, and stability results of a lifetime. ADULT During this stage, a very gradual decline of muscle size and strength is expected. The shape of the body changes subtly over time, frequently expanding at the waistline. With the obligations of “real life,” the adult athlete faces less training time and, in general, a less active lifestyle. For the adult athlete, the objective is maintenance. Holding on to physical fitness is certainly a challenge. As the years go by, maintenance should be viewed as improvement! With an ongoing routine of frequent swimming and strength work, it is possible for a swimmer to maintain his or her speed into the 40s and 50s. 55 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 55 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 58 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming A routine that includes strength training for an hour encompassing weights, stretch bands, medicine balls and self-resistance for three days a week will provide such maintenance. At this stage, it is important to make time for two days of solid rest as recovery just takes longer. SENIOR In the golden years, decline in the size and strength of muscles is evident, which sometimes contributes to balance and mobility problems. In addition, seniors can face bone strength and flexibility issues affecting posture and range of motion. Still, the senior who stays active and strong will be in a much better position to make the most of his or her ability to move freely through the water.

balance and mobility problems. In addition, seniors can face bone strength and flexibility issues affecting posture and range of motion. Still, the senior who stays active and strong will be in a much better position to make the most of his or her ability to move freely through the water. At this stage of development, the objective is flexibility and weight- bearing activity. Strength training is an essential part of a swimmer’s training routine. A program that includes conservative weights, stretch cords, and medicine balls, as well as self-resistance, two to three days a week for 30 minutes or more can produce bone density improvements, slow muscle decline, and along with the typical benefits of swimming, contribute to a better quality of life. 56 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 56 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 59 Text --- Stages of Development JUST KEEP SWIMMING Joy was a dedicated mother. For almost two decades, she devoted herself to the task of raising her twins to become happy, healthy, productive adults. She parented to encourage individuality, responsibility, compassion and self-respect. She strived to be a good example to her children. On their 18th birthday, Joy felt an immense sense of pride. Still, shortly thereafter, when they moved out on their own, she felt empty inside. A divorced 48-year-old, Joy looked at herself in the mirror and asked, “Who am I?” Her empty house and the new availability of time took quite a while to adjust to, but one day, Joy woke up with an idea. One of the good examples she had provided for her children was to maintain a regular physical fitness routine throughout their childhood.

One of the good examples she had provided for her children was to maintain a regular physical fitness routine throughout their childhood. An active competitive swimmer in her youth, Joy had chosen swimming as her fitness activity, going to the pool twice a week before daylight for an hour or so to swim laps. Although she was no longer a speed demon in the pool, she had maintained a healthy weight, good muscle tone and flexibility that other mothers often admired. Now that she didn’t have to hurry back home to meet the responsibilities of the household, she decided to re-dedicate herself to her sport. She increased her swimming time, adding another day a week, and then another half hour per session. She added variety to her swimming routine by doing sets and different strokes. It was not long before Joy started feeling the effects of her efforts and soon was able to do 100s on the 1:30 like she had when she was a teenager. Swimming became the passion in Joy’s life. She loved the challenge and confidence that swimming gave her. She kept track of her workouts, recording her yardage and tracking her progress toward benchmarks she set for herself. She read books on swimming science and technique, and incorporated what she learned into her swimming routine, even adding some stretch cord work to her program three times a week. At age 65, Joy was thrilled to become the grandmother of twins. To celebrate this milestone, she decided to enter a competition for adult swimmers. With anticipation, but no expectations, she arrived at the event and was pleased that she, by no means, was the oldest swimmer present. Elated by the camaraderie and positive atmosphere she encountered, she swam to a second place finish in the 200 backstroke.

Stretch cords are simply lengths of surgical tubing with loops or handles for each hand. When secured in the middle to a stationary pole, the stretch cord enables the swimmer to simulate the entire range of motion that makes up the power phase of the stroke against resistance. Stretch cords also require the use of an accelerating motion to accomplish the action successfully, exactly like swimming. The motion is repeated with a controlled reverse action or recovery between each exertion. The swimmer can use a tempo equal to his or her swimming tempo against resistance or practice an “ideal” higher tempo. Stretch cords also promote core stabilization, as the swimmer must maintain constant tension in

swimming. The motion is repeated with a controlled reverse action or recovery between each exertion. The swimmer can use a tempo equal to his or her swimming tempo against resistance or practice an “ideal” higher tempo. Stretch cords also promote core stabilization, as the swimmer must maintain constant tension in the body from the standing position, bent forward at the waist, while the arms are moving. Stretch cords are available in a variety of thicknesses, which determine their resistance. Because too much resistance will make proper technique impossible, it is important to start with a stretch band that has less resistance and work up to more resistance when good technique is maintained. The following stretch cord exercises are highly recommended: 82 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 82 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 85 Text --- Let’s Get Specific FULL BODY Double Arm Pull — Standing and bent forward at the waist, hold the stretch cord in both hands and perform the underwater path of butterfly, accelerating throughout. Recover gently following the same path. Repeat. Alternating Arm Pull — Standing and bent forward at the waist, hold the stretch cord with both hands and perform the underwater path of freestyle, accelerating toward the end with one arm while the other recovers gently following the reverse path. Repeat in an alternating manner. Double Triceps Press — Standing straight, hold the stretch cord with both hands, with the elbows at a right angle and firmly against the sides of the body. Straighten the arms quickly without moving elbows. Recover gently along the same path. Repeat.

The stretch band is an excellent tool for shoulder maintenance. Also known as a therapy band, this narrow sheet of latex provides much less resistance than the stretch cord, which is not recommended for shoulder stabilization work. Stretch band exercises for shoulder stability include: UPPer­BOdY/arMS External Sweep — With one end of the stretch band anchored at elbow level to the left of the body, hold the other end of the band in the right hand, across the belly button, with the elbow bent to 90 degrees and held firm to the side of the body.

With the right hand, reach down behind the back and grasp the other end of the stretch band. Gently pull the band up with the left hand, then down with the right hand repeatedly, as if scrubbing the back. Repeat with hands in opposite positions. 85 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 85 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 88 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming EXERCISE MACHINES Exercise machines provide a great aerobic component to a land-based routine, raising the heart rate and contributing to endurance. Many are valuable for developed athletes as a warm-up before lifting weights or performing other strength training activities. A few contribute additional opportunities for building force and explosiveness as well. As they are designed for adult frames, they should not be used by young children. The best exercise machines for warm-ups are listed below: Exercise Bike — A stationary bicycle that can be set at various resistances. Comes in reclining or upright models.

Additional beneficial exercise machines for swimmers include: Swim Bench — Replicates swimming motion, including accelerating movement, and encourages correct technique against more resistance than the water provides. It also encourages the swimmer to accelerate move- ments throughout each exertion. Erg — Also known as the rowing machine, the erg builds force and power very well, closely replicating the full-body requirements of rowing, which in many ways are similar to swimming. 87 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 87 12.07.11 12:12 --- OCR from Page 89 Image 2 --- ay) --- Page 90 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming WEIGHTS Weightlifting is recommended only for athletes who have reached the young adult stage of development.

Fundamental principles represent the foundation from which you can structure a program that will have predictable and positive results. HOW MUCH AND HOW MANY? These are very important questions when it comes to strength training. We must clearly understand the significance of how much resistance, how many repetitions, at what rate, and how much frequency and duration is necessary in relation to our strength training objectives. Without this knowledge, we could end up with a different outcome than intended. More quantity does not always translate to more strength. Knowing “how much” and “how many” is as important as knowing which exercises to do. HOW MUCH RESISTANCE? With self-resistance work, the load that is resisted is exclusively the swimmer’s body weight, but when external load is added, as with stretch cords, medicine balls and weights, the question of how much resistance needs to be answered. In general, to build power,

which exercises to do. HOW MUCH RESISTANCE? With self-resistance work, the load that is resisted is exclusively the swimmer’s body weight, but when external load is added, as with stretch cords, medicine balls and weights, the question of how much resistance needs to be answered. In general, to build power, the athlete should be able to repeat the exercise with a load 12 to 15 times without failure. If he or she cannot do this, the load is too much. If it is extremely easy, the load is too little. In contrast, to build force, a larger load should be used. The athlete should be able to repeat an exercise only about three to five times. Again, if he or she cannot do this, the load is too much. If it is extremely easy, the load is too little. HOW MANY REPETITIONS? We also need to know how many times to repeat a particular action or sequence. We count repetitions, or reps, and we count sets. A rep is a single action of the exercise. Use the guidelines described above for reps. A set is a group of reps. Multiple sets have rest between them. As far as how many 97 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 97 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 100 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming sets to do, when the objective is force or explosiveness, fewer sets are done, and sometimes, only a single set is performed. When the objective is power or endurance, more sets are done. Most people do three to five sets when training for power. HOW MUCH RATE? How fast or slowly an exercise is repeated also is determined by the strength training objective. An exercise done at a faster rate tends to build force and explosiveness. An exercise done at slower rate tends

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
Most people do three to five sets when training for power. HOW MUCH RATE? How fast or slowly an exercise is repeated also is determined by the strength training objective. An exercise done at a faster rate tends to build force and explosiveness. An exercise done at slower rate tends to build power. With some exercises, it is possible to simulate swimming tempo very well by allowing the athlete to perform repetitions at a rate of about one per second. Stretch cord work is a good example of this. Some exercises are not designed for stroke tempo work, so do not attempt to achieve such a tempo. The Lat Pull is a good example of an exercise that should not be used for tempo work as it is very important not to rush the recovery, but to control it instead. HOW RESISTANCE, REPETITIONS AND RATE WORK TOGETHER To get the intended outcome, we look at the amount of resistance, or load, the number of repetitions and sets, and the rate that the exercise is performed together. For instance, if our objective is to develop force, we must pair fewer repetitions and sets with more load. If we try to build force by increasing both the number of repetitions and the load at the same time, the swimmer will soon experience failure, and the objective will not be met. In contrast, if our objective is to develop power, we must pair more repetitions and sets with less resistance. If we try to build power by increasing both the number of repetitions and the load at the same time, the swimmer will soon experience failure, and the objective will not be met. HOW MUCH FREQUENCY AND DURATION? Frequency refers to the number of strength training sessions in a week, month or season.

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
training develop better endurance, as swimming, which builds endurance very well, becomes an extension of a “super workout” begun on land, requiring the swimmer to adapt to a greater workload. On the other hand, some believe that since swimming elongates the muscles, strength work that follows swimming ensures that the swimmer’s muscles are well warmed up and less vulnerable to injury from the demands of land training. They also argue that when strength training follows the water workout, the quality of the swimming is higher because a swimmer who is tired after strength training practices swimming slower, with less force, power and explosiveness, reinforcing undesirable habits. Finally, many take the position that swimming first allows the swimmer to feel and utilize the strength that he or she has adapted to in the water where it counts. So which is best? There are valid arguments for both. From the perspective of preparing a swimmer to race, to be ready to perform under less than ideal conditions, including poor weather, crowded warm-up areas and meet delays, a program that uses a bit of both approaches should be considered. By mixing it up, the swimmer will practice adapting to different situations. Further, changing the order of the training routine from time to time will keep it from becoming boring, as the swimmer will stay challenged to perform under different circumstances. The final decision should be based on what best works for the individual athlete. 99 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 99 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 102 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Scheduling rest time is as important as scheduling workout time. Even routines based solely on self-resistance work should allow at least two days off per week. When the content of the strength work includes external load, at least three rest days are

Wearing Shoes Although most swimmers are very comfortable in bare feet around the pool deck, shoes should be mandatory for any strength training activity involving external weight or moving with impact on the feet. While many exercises can be done safely without shoes on the pool deck or gym, it is never acceptable to be barefoot in the weight room where obstacles are many or when using any exercise machine with moving parts. Self-resistance work that involves running, jumping, or changing directions can put excessive pressure on bare feet. Shoes will provide support as well as protection from sharp objects hidden in grass and rough surfaces. 101 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 101 12.07.11 12:13 --- OCR from Page 103 Image 1 --- NO RUNNING NO DIVING --- Page 104 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Tying Hair Back Long hair back should be tied back to ensure good visibility at all times and to avoid entanglement in machines. WARM-UP The purpose of warming up before strength training is exactly the same as at the beginning of a swimming workout. Warming up prepares the body to work by loosening up and activating the muscles, and raising the heart rate to circulate oxygen-rich blood to the muscles. Swimmers should spend at least a quarter of their strength training time warming up. Good warm-up activities include: • Relaxed Arm Circles • Hanging Arm Circles • Cherry Pickers • Jumping Jacks • Running • Skipping • Side Steps • Stairs • Skating • Jump Rope 102 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 102 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 105 Text --- The Fundamentals TAKE IT EASY ON THE STRETCHING!

Rope 102 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 102 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 105 Text --- The Fundamentals TAKE IT EASY ON THE STRETCHING! Stretching has long been a traditional part of warming up before exercise, but the fact is, stretching has injured many swimmers. There are two reasons for this: 1. Stretching does not prepare the body to work, as a warm-up should do. By using valuable warm-up time for stretching, a swimmer runs out of time to do activities that raise the heart rate and activate the muscles. Beginning a workout in this state leaves the body more prone to injury. In addition, without a good warm-up, some or all of the workout is wasted because the swimmer is not prepared to exert. 2. In general, swimmers have very mobile joints, so stretching is really unnecessary. This is especially true of shoulder stretching. Because the shoulders are so central to swimming, they are commonly the site of soreness for many swimmers. In an effort to relieve soreness, we turn to stretching. But what happens when these muscles are stretched is that too much looseness develops, which can lead to joint stability problems during swimming, producing more soreness and pain. Instead of stretching as a warm-up, swimmers should spend warm-up time doing full-body activity with gradually progressive effort. As far as the shoulders, rather than stretching, the focus should be on stabilizing mobility at the joints to keep them operating correctly. This is done through specific shoulder stabilization exercises, as shown on page 94-95. If stretching is done at all, it should be done after exercise. It should be very conservative and target only the large muscles, not the joints. Even this kind of stretching should be gentle and gradual. Under no circumstances should any bouncing action be used.

page 94-95. If stretching is done at all, it should be done after exercise. It should be very conservative and target only the large muscles, not the joints. Even this kind of stretching should be gentle and gradual. Under no circumstances should any bouncing action be used. Under no circumstances should another swimmer apply external stretching pressure for you. Under no circumstances should stretching hurt, either during or after you do it. 103 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 103 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 106 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming When exercise machines are available, warm-ups can include: • Exercise Bike • Elliptical Trainer • Treadmill COOL DOWN Just as after swimming, the cool down is important to let body systems and muscles adjust to the resting state. After exercise, allow several minutes of slow, continuous activity so the heart rate can return to normal and the muscles can begin to relax. One of the best cool down activities is walking. FORM Form is as important in strength training as it is in the water. Form determines the manner in which the swimmer’s body interacts with the resistance. It is important to spend time perfecting the swimmer’s form on any particular exercise before it is repeated over and over. Correct form ensures that the swimmer will use the intended muscles groups in the intended fashion. Incorrect form can lead to poor results, including injury. POSTURE Our symmetrical bodies are designed with many bilateral muscles, including the lats, the obliques, the pectoralis major and the deltoids, among others. However, when one part of our body is out of alignment, the mirror image muscles are very adept at taking over the work. Repeated exercise with poor posture can result in bilateral muscles developing unevenly as one side compensates for the other. As swimming

perform. It will also keep you from fatiguing as quickly. CONTROL It is important to control every movement against resistance, both in the power phase and recovery. Always maintain balance and stability during the power phase. Always return to the starting position gently and with less speed. Never allow an external load to jerk the limbs back to the starting position. 105 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 105 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 108 Text --- 106 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 106 12.07.11 12:13 --- OCR from Page 108 Image 1 --- PEN SARA ANCA IN . z --- Page 109 Text --- Routines and Circuits 7 ROUTINES AND CIRCUITS This section contains strength training routines and circuits for all stages of development. Because the six stages of development identified earlier in this book are not isolated but are more of a continuum, merging one into the next, the routines and circuits are presented in four progressive levels with specific content to meet particular developmental objectives. Use these routines and circuits as examples for structure and content, then tailor them to the needs of the individual swimmer.

has a much neater swimming technique: most of the movement comes from her hips, not her knees, and she is kicking mostly underwater with only her heels breaking the surface. --- Page 10 Text --- SWIMMING IS SIMPLE swim verb float, glide, slip, stroke, submerge, move or propel yourself through water using natural means such as arms and legs At heart, swimming is simple. The basic techniques – arm pull and recovery, kick, and body movement – aren’t especially complicated. But unless you’ve been a competitive swimmer, you probably don’t really have a clear idea of what you should be trying to achieve. This chapter gives you that information. WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR Aim for a smooth stroke, your body rolling from side to side with each arm stroke, but always straight and level in the water. Breathing should be a seamless --- OCR from Page 10 Image 1 --- ea . * gent ye 2 nee --- Page 11 Text --- part of the side-to-side roll that comes with each arm stroke. Your legs kick in a rhythm that matches your arms. FRONT CRAWL ARM PULL Each front crawl arm pull should be a smooth arm movement. However, when thinking about your technique it’s useful to divide each arm stroke into four stages: 1. Entry 2. Catch 3. Pull 4. Recovery The underwater part of each stroke begins slow and gets faster. Your hand accelerates, moving faster as you reach the end of the pull. Stage 1: Entry Your arm enters the water fingertips first, with the thumb side angled slightly downward. It goes in level with your shoulder (rather than your nose). Your hand then stretches forward, still off centre, and turns so that it’s flat to the bottom of the pool. Stage 2: Catch Your arm begins

arm enters the water fingertips first, with the thumb side angled slightly downward. It goes in level with your shoulder (rather than your nose). Your hand then stretches forward, still off centre, and turns so that it’s flat to the bottom of the pool. Stage 2: Catch Your arm begins to bend and your hand sweeps downward, with your elbow bent and staying high. At this point your body has rolled, so that the pulling side is slightly down and the other side slightly up. This stage of your stroke feels like a powered glide, maintaining your speed but not increasing it. Stage 3: Pull The pull is the stage that adds speed. Most swimmers pull in a slightly curved path. Their hand sweeps in from the line of their shoulder to just inside the outer line of their body, then out again to leave the water with their thumb brushing their hip or thigh. Other swimmers find that a feeling of pulling straight back works best (though the roll of their body means they don’t actually pull straight backward). --- Page 12 Text --- Stage 4: Recovery Your elbow leaves the water before your hand, and leads the recovery. Leading with your hand rather than your elbow is a common mistake. It often causes the body to twist and kink, rather than keeping in a straight line. It’s important to relax your arm during the recovery, as this helps you swim smoothly. BREATHING --- Page 13 Text --- Breathing is one of the things lots of untrained swimmers have trouble with. Often it’s because they’re turning their head to breathe by twisting their neck around, lifting their chin, or both. This makes your stroke lumpy and uneven, and tends to lead to snaking along the pool when you should

have to use two stacked up. • Swimming snorkel, which rises in front of your face and is handy in some drills and for practising kick. If you use one of these, you’ll also need a nose clip. --- Page 17 Text --- • Ankle band: this is a rubber band that goes around your ankles, making sure you don’t cheat when you’re supposed to be swimming arms-only. You can make these out of old bike inner tubes. • A rubber hat if you have long hair (which otherwise will drag and affect your head position). If you’re taking part in a triathlon, a specialist tri-suit, which can be worn during all three legs – swim, bike and run – is useful. In cold water, triathletes swim wearing a wetsuit, which makes you more streamlined and buoyant. Keys to success • Count your strokes on every length to get an idea of how your stroke is working. As your stroke becomes more efficient, your should find you are taking fewer strokes per length when swimming at the same pool. • Swim with a smooth arm and leg action, moving continuously; avoid jerky, splashy actions • Keep your body straight. Side-to-side roll is good, but twisting and kinking is bad --- Page 19 Text --- FLEXIBILITY flexible adj. lissom, supple, lithe, elastic, able to bend or be bent repeatedly without damage or injury This chapter comes before the technique sections for a reason. Put simply, if you lack flexibility, there are some elements of swimming technique you’ll never be able to manage. People with stiff neck, shoulders and back find it particularly hard to master technique, but overall flexibility is important in swimming. STRETCHING TECHNIQUES Never do any stretch to a point where it hurts. You need to be able to

some elements of swimming technique you’ll never be able to manage. People with stiff neck, shoulders and back find it particularly hard to master technique, but overall flexibility is important in swimming. STRETCHING TECHNIQUES Never do any stretch to a point where it hurts. You need to be able to feel a bit of --- Page 20 Text --- pull in the muscles you’re stretching, but if it starts to hurt, gently ease out of the stretch and try again. It’s best to time your movement into the stretch to happen as you breathe out. If you need to take a breath, stop moving while you breathe in. Use your breath When you’ve taken a stretch as far as is comfortable, concentrate on breathing deeply, from your stomach rather than your chest. It helps you relax and get a little more from the stretch. INCREASING FLEXIBILITY To improve their swimming, most people also need to improve their general flexibility. A great way to do this is to take a yoga course. There are lots of different schools of yoga: a gentle one may be best. Scaravelli yoga seems to be useful for swimming, but it’s not that common, and it can be hard to find courses. Hatha yoga is a good alternative. The exercises on the following pages are mainly targeted at swimming (apart from the sun salute for general flexibility). You can do them just about anywhere: sitting in front of the TV, on the poolside, out in the garden. Try to do some flexibility work every day – 15 minutes spent on this pays dividends in the pool. WARMING UP AND WARMING DOWN As well as using stretches to improve your flexibility, make them part of every swimming session. Spend 10 minutes at the start and finish of

garden. Try to do some flexibility work every day – 15 minutes spent on this pays dividends in the pool. WARMING UP AND WARMING DOWN As well as using stretches to improve your flexibility, make them part of every swimming session. Spend 10 minutes at the start and finish of every session doing some stretching. At the start, it prepares your muscles for what’s coming; at the finish, it will reduce any muscle soreness and fatigue you feel the next day. Dynamic stretches are best for warming up, static ones for warming down. GENERAL FLEXIBILITY --- Page 21 Text --- As a simple, time-effective way of improving your general flexibility, it’s hard to beat a bit of yoga. In particular, try following the lead of millions of people and starting each day with a sun salute or two. It’s helpful to have a yoga mat for this, but I do it most mornings on an old carpet and have yet to suffer any ill effects. Sun salute There are slightly differing versions of the sun salute: what’s shown here seems to work well for swimming and cycling. 1. Stand in balance, heels on the floor, feet shoulder-width apart. Be careful not to stick your bottom out. Reach your arms above your head and extend them, but without altering your body position. 2. Bend forward from the waist, keeping your arms stretched out and your feet flat. Touch the ground with your hands, or get as close as you can to that. Relax your jaw, neck, back and stomach so that you’re dangling from the waist. Breathe deeply. Steps 1 and 2 alone are an excellent stretch to do as a way of relaxing your jaw, neck and back muscles. --- Page 22 Text --- 3. Place your hands on the

that. Relax your jaw, neck, back and stomach so that you’re dangling from the waist. Breathe deeply. Steps 1 and 2 alone are an excellent stretch to do as a way of relaxing your jaw, neck and back muscles. --- Page 22 Text --- 3. Place your hands on the floor. Bend one leg, and place the other one straight back behind you. Drop your hips (make sure not to twist them sideways), and feel the stretch in your groin. 4. Bring the bent leg back beside the extended one, so that you end up in a dead- straight press-up position. Hold this – it can be a bit of a trembler – for two or three breaths. Hold each pose Spend a little time in each pose. Holding each one for about five deep, long --- Page 23 Text --- breaths is usually about right. 5. Drop your knees to the floor and, keeping your arms stretched out in front of you, scrunch up like someone praying. 6. Pivot forward and drop your hips to the floor, arching your lower back while extending through the shoulders and neck and pushing up with straight arms. --- Page 24 Text --- Imagine your head is lifting upward, and avoid arcing your neck back. 7. Push up on to all fours, with straight back legs and bent at the waist. You’re aiming to make an upside-down V shape. Keep your legs and arms as straight as possible, and if you can manage it have your feet flat on the floor (this isn’t crucial). Relax, especially your shoulders, neck and jaw. It should feel as if your head is dangling loosely between your shoulders. --- Page 25 Text --- 8. Step forward with the same leg as stepped back in step 3 of

it have your feet flat on the floor (this isn’t crucial). Relax, especially your shoulders, neck and jaw. It should feel as if your head is dangling loosely between your shoulders. --- Page 25 Text --- 8. Step forward with the same leg as stepped back in step 3 of the sun salute. You should find yourself in a mirror image of the position from step 3. 9. Return to the position shown in step 2 of the sun salute. 10. Either finish as in step 1, but in reverse: standing back up with straight arms out in front and your weight on the balls of your feet. Or, ending with your arms hanging down at your sides. In this, try to imagine each individual vertebra straightening, starting from the very bottom of your spine. Let your arms dangle loosely, and keep your neck and jaw relaxed. --- Page 29 Text --- HIPS AND TORSO Tightness in this area, in the middle of your body, affects your ability to roll from side to side while maintaining a steady, smooth kicking action. It can also make it harder to stretch forward as your hand enters the water. These stretches improve flexibility in the hips, groin and related muscles. Hip stretch 1 Sit down with your legs out straight in front of you. Bent and lift your right leg, placing your foot on the outside of your left knee. Turn to the right, keeping your hips level and your bottom flat on the ground. Place your left forearm outside your right knee then gently move your right knee outward. Hold for five deep breaths, then repeat on the other side. Hip stretch 1. Hip stretch 2 From a standing position, take a lunge step forward. Kneel on your rear knee: this knee

the ground. Place your left forearm outside your right knee then gently move your right knee outward. Hold for five deep breaths, then repeat on the other side. Hip stretch 1. Hip stretch 2 From a standing position, take a lunge step forward. Kneel on your rear knee: this knee needs to be behind your hip. Cup your hands over your front knee, then move your hips forward until you feel the stretch in your hip and upper thigh. Your front knee should be at an angle of at least 90°. Hold the stretch for several deep, long breaths, then repeat with the other leg. --- Page 30 Text --- Hip stretch 2. Side stretch This simple stretch is great is you’re having trouble extending forward after your hand enters the water. Concentrate on breathing deeply and relaxing into the stretch. Stand in the starting position for the sun salute. Make sure your hips are tucked in and relaxed, and your feet shoulder-width apart (this is closer together than most people think – use a mirror or the reflection in a window to check, if you can). Bring your arms above your head, and hold your left wrist with your right hand. Lean to the right: take care to keep your body facing forward, don’t let yourself turn your shoulders or hips in the direction of the stretch. When you feel a stretch down your side, hold the position for several deep breaths, then return to the starting point. Repeat for the other side. --- Page 32 Text --- SHOULDERS AND NECK These two stretches help with your shoulder mobility, which is crucial for swimming front crawl.

for the other side. --- Page 32 Text --- SHOULDERS AND NECK These two stretches help with your shoulder mobility, which is crucial for swimming front crawl. Doing them regularly makes stretching forward after your arm has entered the water much easier. This starts your body rolling and puts it in the correct position for the rest of the arm pull. Don’t worry if you find these stretches easier on one side than the other – almost everyone has the same experience. Crossed-forearms stretch 1. Stand or sit upright looking straight ahead, with your shoulders relaxed. Take a deep breath, and as you let it out, bring your arms up and forward, and cross them at the elbows. 2. Bring the forearm of the lower arm inward, and cup your fingertips in the heel of the other hand. Take another deep breath and relax your jaw and shoulders, letting the shoulders drop. Try to keep them in this position throughout. 3. Slowly lift your elbows up and forward (don’t forget to keep your shoulders relaxed). As your elbows rise, you should feel the stretch engage different muscles between your shoulder blades. Move your elbows up and down slowly several times, holding them in position and taking a couple of deep breaths if you feel an area of tightness. --- Page 33 Text --- 4. Release, and repeat with the opposite elbow highest. Reaching-behind stretch 1. Again, stand or sit up straight. Relax your jaw and shoulders, and let your shoulders drop. Lift one arm up and out to the side with a bent elbow, reach around behind your head, and tuck your elbow around the back of your head. Aim for your forearm to be dangling down the line of your spine. 2. Bring your other arm behind your back,

drop. Lift one arm up and out to the side with a bent elbow, reach around behind your head, and tuck your elbow around the back of your head. Aim for your forearm to be dangling down the line of your spine. 2. Bring your other arm behind your back, letting the back of your hand rest at the base of your spine. Bend your elbow, and work your hand up the line of your spine. You’re aiming for the back of your hand to be resting between your shoulder blades. 3. Try to place the palms of your hands together. Don’t overstrain this stretch: as ever, this is likely to cause injury. Very few people can manage this stretch first go (even second, or twenty-second go). You may only be able to get your fingertips to touch, or not be able to touch your hands at all. Don’t worry, this is a good thing – it means you have an obvious area where your swimming stroke can be improved. --- Page 34 Text --- Never clench! Some people learn a version of this stretch in which they link their fingers together, like one Action Man stopping another from plunging into a chasm. This can lead to overstretching or injury; it’s best just to let your hands touch. LEGS It’s not immediately apparent, but relaxed, flexible legs are important when swimming freestyle. Your kicking action should be light and loose, coming from the hips: anything else is likely to upset your stroke. You’ll only achieve this ‘flutter kick’ if your legs and ankles are flexible. Leg stretch 1 Stand well away from a wall, with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lean forward and rest your palms against the wall, stepping one leg forward too. The other leg stays straight, with your

your stroke. You’ll only achieve this ‘flutter kick’ if your legs and ankles are flexible. Leg stretch 1 Stand well away from a wall, with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lean forward and rest your palms against the wall, stepping one leg forward too. The other leg stays straight, with your foot flat on the floor and pointing forward. Bend your elbows and feel the stretch in the back of your leg. After several deep, slow breaths, return to the starting position and repeat the exercise with the other leg stretched out behind. Finally, place both feet together and repeat once more. --- Page 35 Text --- Leg stretch 1. Leg stretch 2 This one is good for your hamstrings if you’ve ridden a bike to the pool. Sit up straight, with your legs out in front of you and your toes pointing up in the air. Move one foot back, sliding the sole along the calf and thigh of your other leg. Staying upright, reach forward with both hands and place your fingertips on the toes of the foot pointing up in the air. Hold the stretch for five deep breaths or so, return to the starting position, and repeat for the other leg. --- Page 36 Text --- Leg stretch 2. Leg stretch 3 Stand upright, next to a wall if your balance isn’t great. Lift one foot behind you, hold it with your hand, and press your heel into your bottom. Here you might need to grab something for balance. Hold the stretch while you breathe deeply several times, release your foot and let it swing gently forward. Repeat using the other leg. Take care with this stretch not to arch your lower back when you pull your foot in: your hips should stay level with the ground.

for balance. Hold the stretch while you breathe deeply several times, release your foot and let it swing gently forward. Repeat using the other leg. Take care with this stretch not to arch your lower back when you pull your foot in: your hips should stay level with the ground. --- Page 37 Text --- Leg stretch 3. WARMING UP Stretching has a part to play in warming up before a training session (whether it’s a technique session or a fitness one). Lots of English people feel embarrassed about stretching on the side of the pool – it’s seen as a bit effete or unnecessary. But warming up properly prepares your body for exercise, making injury much less likely. Warming up – legs If you can, one of the best ways of getting your body systems going before a swimming session is to cycle to the pool. A distance of about 10km will wake your muscles up to the fact that they’re exercising, prepare the joints in your hips, knees and ankles, and lift your heart rate. Don’t race: just go at a speed that would make holding a conversation moderately tricky. Once you get to the pool, you’ll need to stretch your hamstrings a bit, because cycling only offers them a limited range of movement. Leg stretch 2 is good for this. --- Page 38 Text --- Most people have one area of their body that needs a little extra flexibility work. If you’re a keen cyclist it may be your hamstrings. If you sit at a desk all day, that can result in tight hip flexor muscles. If you do have an area of particular inflexibility, it’s worth getting expert advice about how to address it, because the problem doesn’t always originate from the place where you can

be your hamstrings. If you sit at a desk all day, that can result in tight hip flexor muscles. If you do have an area of particular inflexibility, it’s worth getting expert advice about how to address it, because the problem doesn’t always originate from the place where you can feel the stiffness. Warming up – shoulders and upper body Your shoulders will need a bit more work, because they haven’t been doing much on the bike. Start with the shoulders and neck stretches, and the forward bend (this does have a slightly 1930s-Swedish-exercise feel to it, but is very effective nonetheless). Warm up your shoulders further with some active movement. Do this one arm at a time. Windmill your arm backward, a bit like doing backstroke. Start slowly, trying to relax your shoulder so that there’s no creaking, clicking or straining. Steadily build up the speed of the windmills until you feel a slight tingling in your fingertips. Maintain the movement for 10 full windmills, and stop. Breathe out and relax your shoulders, then repeat with the other arm. Next do the whole thing again, but this time with each arm windmilling forward, a bit like doing freestyle. --- Page 39 Text --- Static stretches like this are often used for warming down, but some swimmers also include them in their warm-up. --- Page 40 Text --- Dynamic stretching like this arm windmilling is ideal for warming up before you get in the pool. Remember, your movements shouldn’t be too sudden or severe. WARMING DOWN Including a proper warm-down in your swimming routine has several benefits. The key one is that a warm-down containing some stretching will prevent or ease the muscle soreness you feel later. --- Page 41 Text --- For swimmers, a warm-down in two parts is

too sudden or severe. WARMING DOWN Including a proper warm-down in your swimming routine has several benefits. The key one is that a warm-down containing some stretching will prevent or ease the muscle soreness you feel later. --- Page 41 Text --- For swimmers, a warm-down in two parts is a good idea: 1. Swim a reasonable distance (for most people, between 100m and 400m is about right) at a steady pace. Don’t crawl along so slowly you’re practically sinking, just don’t push things. Concentrate on keeping your stroke long and balanced, trying to glide through the water. 2. Do a few key stretches. My favourites are the shoulder stretches, the forward bend, and the leg stretch. You’ll find the ones that work for you: the areas where you tend to feel muscle soreness will guide you, but don’t forget that this will change as your stroke develops. --- Page 42 Text --- EATING Try to eat something – a banana, a sandwich or a flapjack, something that has a carbohydrate element – within 15 minutes or so of finishing a training session. This is a window of time in which your body efficiently replaces the muscle energy that is burned during demanding exercise. In general, swimming doesn’t require a special diet. Just try to eat a balance of different foods, and avoid too many fatty, fried meals and alcohol. If you’re swimming partly with the aim of losing weight, bear in mind that the only way to do this is to burn more calories than you eat, which will cause feelings of --- Page 43 Text --- hunger.

This allows you to glide along, rather than fighting your way down the pool. There are four key elements to a good streamlined style: 1. The right head angle 2. Correct chest and hip position 3. Good body roll --- Page 45 Text --- 4. Eliminating twist HEAD ANGLE The angle at which you hold your head has a big effect, because it’s linked to your upper body. This in turn affects your hips, which in turn affect your leg kick. Most swimmers hold their heads too high (partly as a result of the need to see where you’re going in a public pool). Aim to swim looking at the bottom of the pool, perhaps very slightly ahead but with your neck basically in line with your body.

roughly the same level in the water, just below the surface. Most people naturally hold their body a little bit bent forward, so to be dead flat you have to slightly extend your chest, stomach and hips, as in the streamlined position drill. Hip dragger or bottom waggler? Swimmers with their chest and hips in an inefficient, draggy position are a common sight in pools around the world. The two key problems are dragging your hips (swimming with them lower in the water than your chest), and lifting your hips so that your bottom sticks up. It’s hard to know for yourself if you have either of these problems, so ask a friend to watch you swim and tell you. Hip draggers: Hip dragging is often caused by a poor catch, a weak or poor leg --- Page 47 Text --- kick (for advice on how to improve this, see here) or a too-high head position. It’s often also linked to a lack of flexibility in your hips: see the hip torso stretches that can help improve this. Bottom wagglers: Bottom waggling often happens when swimmers have a poor kicking technique or a too-low head position. Using the head position just mentioned may get rid of the problem. It’s also useful to work on improving extension through the chest and stomach, pushing down slightly with the buttocks and opening the hips. This should bring your head and shoulders forward and up, and your bottom down.

Push off the wall, and float on the surface in a streamlined position.

Have your arms relaxed and stretched out in front of you. 2. Keeping your arms straight, scull them out and in together (i.e. both arms at the same time). Have your hands angled a little downward, and scoop them around so that they’re facing slightly out as you scull out, and slightly inward as you scull in. 3. Keep this motion going in a continuous rhythm, sculling your way down

2. Push off along the line, concentrating on keeping your head and the centre line of your body directly above it. Take an arm stroke, leaving the other arm extended in front of you. 3. Delay the pull of your extended arm until the recovering arm is just about to enter the water. Repeat this stroke and rhythm with the other arm, and carry on all the way down the pool. There are several versions of the catch-up drill. Two of the most useful are full catch-up and reverse catch-up. Full catch-up This is essentially the same drill as three-quarter catch-up, but harder. Instead of starting your arm pull as the recovering arm is about to enter the water, wait until it has slid beneath the surface and is starting to extend. --- Page 126 Text --- Full catch-up Reverse catch-up This drill demands (and so trains you to) a greater level of coordination between body roll and breathing. In reverse catch-up, instead of one arm being stretched out unmoving in front of you, it rests by your side with your hand by your hip. This is basically putting the ‘stop’ in at the other end of your arm pull, before the recovery instead of after. Tarzan-and-Jane This advanced drill is great for checking how well you’re able to keep your body swimming straight, without twisting or kinking. It’s a good one for open- water racers, including triathletes: it helps you get a sense for swimming in a straight line without being able to see where you’re going the whole time. I call this the Tarzan-and-Jane drill, because I started doing it when I was a kid, after seeing Jonny Weissmuller and Maureen O’Sullivan, as Tarzan and Jane, swimming like this in a jungle pool. --- Page 127 Text ---

position. Start your stroke as usual, but keep one arm reaching out in front of you the whole time. Take arm strokes only with the other arm. 2. Focus on making sure you have good body roll, and breathe on your pulling-arm side. Breathe as infrequently as possible, but don’t let the drill become an aerobic challenge: you need to be swimming within yourself, rather than gasping for air. You can swim a whole length using just one arm, or take a certain number of breaths before changing sides. I prefer to change sides every four to six strokes, as it feels more balanced, but experiment to find the pattern that works best for you. --- Page 131 Text --- This is a tough drill, and under stress this swimmer has lifted his head, compromising his streamlined position in the water. He is, though, showing a very nice high-elbow pull. Trailing-arm variation This harder variation of the one-arm drill works your technique in a different way. In this version you leave your non-pulling arm trailing at your side, rather than reaching out in front of you, and breathe on the non-pulling side.

The drill loosens up your torso, gives a really strong feeling for swimming on your side, and a feel for the rotation of your hips and kicking action as you breathe. 1. Push off the wall and take an arm stroke. Keep your other arm extended, and breathe on this first stroke, as you would coming to the surface after a turn. 2. After the recovery, stay rolled to the side and take a second arm stroke with the same arm. Use the forward movement of your arm as it enters the water and the turn of your head after the breath to create a butterfly motion of your body. Let this motion wave down your body, ending in a kick. 3. After two arm strokes on one side, repeat the pattern on the other side, pulling with the other arm, rolling your body in that direction and breathing on a new side. --- Page 133 Text --- SWIMMING BLIND You do need an empty lane to try this! But it’s a really good way to judge how straight and balanced your stroke is. Most of us are constantly making teeny little body adjustments to keep swimming in a straight line. These are based on visual inputs that you don’t consciously register. Take them away, and a truer idea of how balanced your technique is will emerge. I also find swimming blind is a useful way of concentrating on how your stroke feels.

water going up your nose. Getting used to tumbling Lots of swimmers get disoriented about which way is up when they try to learn tumble turns. They quickly get a snortful of water up their nose, come up coughing and spluttering, and give up. The trick to learning a tumble turn is to break it down into stages. This drill is the first step: getting used to tumbling underwater. 1. Push off the wall, but instead of adopting a streamlined position, push off with both hands by your sides. 2. Before you lose too much momentum, tuck your chin into your chest and --- OCR from Page 139 Image 1 --- Jaki sy lil wt ae yay --- Page 140 Text --- start a forward-roll motion. Lead with your head, and aim for this to be a snappy and definite movement. 3. Let your body, then your legs, follow your head around. Make your body as compact as possible, so that you tumble over quickly, and bend your legs too. Only take a breath when you’ve come back to the surface facing the same way as you were moving. Arm stretch tumble This drill first adds an element of stretching your arm out in front of you to tumble over, then of swimming into the tumble. 1. Push off the wall as in the push-off drill, except with one arm extended in the streamlined position. Have the other arm against your side. 2. Before you lose momentum, perform the tumble. The movement is similar to the previous drill, but this time it’s your arm that drives it, rather than your head: begin an arm pull, but continue the motion underneath your body, as if reaching back toward the space between your knees. 3.

Practise this drill with both right and left arm stretching forward: later on this will mean you can turn whether it’s your right or left arm that makes the last stroke of the length. Leading with your arm This drill simply adds together two skills you already have: swimming freestyle and tumbling. It also teaches you how the angle at which you drive the turn with your arm affects the angle at which you tumble. 1. Push off the side of the wall into the streamlined position, then start swimming. Take a breath as you come up to the surface, then two or three strokes. 2. As you finish an arm stroke, perform the tumble you learned in the previous drill. Practise this on each arm, left and right. 3. Now try varying the angle at which your hand initiates the tumble. Instead of reaching between your knees, see what happens if you reach outside your left knee or right knee. Note how this affects the angle at which your legs come over during the tumble. For example, reaching outside your left knee with your right hand will mean your legs tumble over to the right-hand side, rather than directly over the centre line of your body. --- Page 143

pool, a smoother, more efficient stroke uses less energy for the same speed. This is probably even more important in open water: events are over longer distances, so the effect of tiny inefficiencies is magnified. One difference from the pool is in stroke rate: open-water swimmers generally swim with a higher arm cadence than pool swimmers, of between 73 and 85 strokes per minute. ADAPTING TO CONDITIONS Open water swimming sometimes – nearly always, in fact – forces you to adapt your technique to the conditions. The key change is that if the water is choppy, a higher recovery of the forearm and hand is needed. This avoids your hand or arm being caught in the chop or wave face. You may also have to adapt your breathing pattern: if waves are coming from the left, breathe to the right, and vice versa. That way you’re less likely to swallow what feels like a small bucketful of water with each stroke. --- Page 157 Text --- Body-rotation mixed drill Good body rotation is as important in open-water swimming as it is in the pool. This mixed drill is hard work when done without fins, so it’s best to start with them on until you’re comfortable with the drill. What you need • Swim fins • Pull buoy 1. Push off in a streamlined position, but with your arms by your sides instead of stretched out ahead. Kick with a steady rhythm. 2. Keep looking downwards, not forwards. Take breaths on alternate sides, simply by rolling your body. Don’t move your arms or turn your neck to breathe, just roll your body. 3.

Keys to success • Keep your stroke smooth • Maintain a streamlined head and body position • Adapt breathing patterns and arm recovery to the conditions • Prepare by swimming in open water, as well as the pool --- Page 176 Text --- TECHNIQUE TRAINING SESSIONS If you want your swimming to improve, you really have to work constantly on your technique. This is particularly true if you’ve introduced a new element to your stroke – the high-elbow pulling action, for example. If you’ve been swimming in a particular style for years, it will take a long time for a new style to become automatic. Until then, you’ll need to keep reminding yourself at regular intervals. WHEN TO WORK ON TECHNIQUE You’re not likely to achieve much if you only ever work on your technique after a hard training session, when you’re tired. It’s easy to slip into thinking you should be training hard, getting fitter, getting stronger, but none of these will bring you as much benefit as improving your technique. It’s best to devote a whole swim purely to technique work: your body and mind are fresh, and you concentrate harder, getting maximum benefit from your time in the water. Alternatively, if your time in the pool is severely squeezed, you could make technique work part of your warm-up, or spend the first part of the session doing drills, before getting into the fitness part of the session. SPEED VERSUS QUALITY Whenever you’re doing any of the exercises or drills in this book (or any others that you’ve developed for yourself), try to make an active decision not to go fast. There’s an old saying that applies here: ‘First, do it. Then, do it right. Last, do it fast.’ Technique

Under Kicking (Chapter 9). Swimmers who are focusing on making their stroke very long often try a two-beat kick to further reduce effort. For many swimmers with poor natural buoyancy or poor ankle flexibility this does not produce enough lift and their legs sink downward. Poor Core Stabilisation (Chapter 10). If you flex through your midsection and aren’t sure how to engage your core muscles to hold your backside and legs high then your legs will likely sink. Pressing Down On The Water During The Catch (Chapter 13). Many swimmers try and overpower the catch phase of the freestyle stroke and end up pressing down on the water with a straight arm. This lifts them up at the front end and sinks their legs at the rear. Poor Hip Flexibility (Chapter 29). Poor hip flexor flexibility from a lot of sitting at an office desk or lots of cycling (especially on tri-bars) can drag the legs low in the water. Work on a few simple stretches before you swim to promote range of movement around the hips. Swimmers with very poor body position normally have three or more of these issues in place in their stroke. For this reason there’s rarely a silver-bullet solution to improving your body position – it takes an all-round approach across many areas of your stroke. It’s important not to become frustrated with this but be calm and persistent in your approach. From the perspective of our Swim Types system, Arnies are the biggest sufferers of low-lying legs, and for very muscular Arnies it is quite possible that they can never achieve as super-high a body position in the water as some female swimmers can. That’s OK, any improvement in body position will reduce drag significantly and is well worth the effort of pursuing. Pressing

toes tend to do the opposite – turn outwards. So guys, you now have an excuse for why your kick isn’t ‘all that’ but don’t let this deter you. Work on turning your toes inwards to improve the effectiveness of your kick. Ankle Flexibility Even though you’re not looking for propulsion from your kick, a lack of flexibility in your ankles can still hold you back. Very stiff ankles from field sports, running or cycling make the top of the foot stick out into the water flow. This creates resistance in itself but also pulls the legs downward, harming your body position and creating a lot of drag. Dorsi flexion (left) and Plantar flexion (right). THE SEA ANCHORS DRILL To experience this for yourself, experiment with using the Sea Anchors Drill. Using a pull buoy, swim 25 m with your toes pointed behind you (technical term: plantar flexion) as normal. Then bring your ankles to 90° with the toes pointing downward (dorsi flexion). Notice the instant and huge effect this has on your body position, which highlights the difference even small improvements in ankle flexibility can bring to your stroke. Using a pull buoy, try switching between dorsi and plantar flexed ankles to experience the effect it has on your body position. If you have very stiff ankles and cannot point your toes straight then we recommend a gentle stretching exercise to loosen off your ankles. You can perform this stretch at any time, perhaps in your office or in front of the TV at home. Don’t rush things, it will take many weeks and months to loosen your ankles off by stretching them little and often using the stretches below. --- Page 68 Text --- Sitting Ankle Stretch ADAM: Many swimmers think that using fins (flippers) in training is

front of the TV at home. Don’t rush things, it will take many weeks and months to loosen your ankles off by stretching them little and often using the stretches below. --- Page 68 Text --- Sitting Ankle Stretch ADAM: Many swimmers think that using fins (flippers) in training is cheating in some way. Nothing could be further from the truth – performing drills with a specific purpose using fins is a very important part of developing your stroke technique as they leave you free to focus on the drill rather than on how hard you need to kick to stay afloat! Did you know that fins can also improve your ankle flexibility and kicking technique at the same time? Any time you kick with fins on they place your feet into a plantar flexed position and so gradually stretch your ankles. They also force you to kick with a straighter leg action. You don’t want to become addicted to swimming with fins but performing a drill set or technique swim of around 400 m will help tune up your leg kick at the same time as you work on other areas of your stroke. Neat! In a seated position cross one leg over the top of the other and hold the foot firmly with the opposing hand. Gently pull the foot straighter, feeling the stretch across the top of the foot and along the shin. Hold for 30 seconds to a minute and then swap sides. As always when stretching use only light force and progress very gradually to avoid injury.

stretching use only light force and progress very gradually to avoid injury. A scissor kick adds a huge amount of drag, it’s like opening up a parachute behind you. --- OCR from Page 68 Image 1 --- int titi MG en Ea --- Page 69 Text --- Scissor Kicks A scissor kick is one of the most common stroke flaws. In fact our records show that approximately 70% of swimmers who attend a Swim Smooth Clinic have a scissor kick in their stroke. Parting the legs like this causes a lot of drag and harms a swimmer’s body position in the water. However, a scissor kick is rarely a problem with the kick itself, instead it’s normally caused by an arm crossing the centre line in front of the head or under the body. This ‘crossover’ causes a loss of balance for the swimmer who parts the legs in a scissoring action to maintain balance, often doing so unknowingly. Fixing the crossover (Chapter 10) will normally remove the scissor kick all by itself, even without any conscious action on behalf of the swimmer. 2-Beat Kicking Technique A 2-beat kick is used by some elite swimmers racing in the pool and open water. For every two arm strokes, two leg kicks are made. The kicks don’t provide much propulsion but they do help drive body rotation, which in turn helps drive the arm stroke. A 2-beat kick suits swimmers with a faster stroke rate style, such as the Swinger Swim Type. A great 2-beat leg kick is poetry in motion and whilst it looks simple is deceptively difficult to master. Generally speaking we only recommend 2-beat kicks for those swimmers with a refined Swinger style (Chapter 22). The Classic Overglider (left) uses a large knee bend to kick-start their stroke after

456–459). Worthington, Ohio: Bertec Corporation. --- Page 72 Text --- CHAPTER 10 Posture and Alignment When thinking about core stability we tend to think about the abdominals, lower back and hip region of the body. This area of the body was the subject of the core stability boom across the sports world in the mid to late 1990s. In swimming terms we would call this the ‘lower core’ and like in many sports, it plays an important role in the pool as we’ll investigate in this chapter. However, the ‘upper core’ – a swimmer’s thoracic spine, their shoulder and scapular region – is thought about much less often but is arguably even more important for good swimming technique. ADAM: One of my roles at Swim Smooth is to manage all of our swimming websites and I spend a lot of time in front of the computer doing this. Working at a computer draws the shoulders and head forwards, shortening the chest muscles and over-stretching between the shoulder blades. As we’ll see in this section, if you have an office job yourself this hunched posture could be doing your swimming real harm. Poor posture at work (left) can negatively impact your swimming but try to avoid over-exaggerating good posture (right) as this puts pressure on your lower back. When we swim we enter the water and extend forwards, the lead hand being controlled by the shoulder, chest and scapular region muscle groups. If your chest muscles are short and the muscles between your scapulae over-stretched, then this tends to draw the lead arm across the centre line of the body causing a crossover in front of the head. A crossover in front of the head is caused by poor swimming posture. --- Page 73 Text --- The solution to a crossover

between your scapulae over-stretched, then this tends to draw the lead arm across the centre line of the body causing a crossover in front of the head. A crossover in front of the head is caused by poor swimming posture. --- Page 73 Text --- The solution to a crossover is not to think about taking the arm wider. It is commonly said that you should be aiming for your hands to enter at ‘10 o’clock and 2 o’clock’ in order to correct a crossover, the theory being that thinking about going wider will result in you becoming straighter. All this would do though is reduce your body rotation and cause you to swim flatter in the water and over time your arms will have a tendency to move wider and wider! Instead of this, the solution to a crossover is to improve your posture by drawing your shoulder blades together and back. We can see in Figure 10.6 how this draws the lead arm straight and also promotes good body rotation. Try this yourself in a standing position. FIGURE 10.6 To remove a crossover pull your shoulder blades together and down to pull your arm straight. PAUL: When you were a child did your parents used to say to you ‘stand up tall and proud – shoulders back chest forwards!’? This is exactly what you need to do to improve your swimming posture.

We will take a good look at some exercises and drills in this section to help you tune in to this part of your --- Page 74 Text --- stroke and we’ll recommend some simple stretches to help loosen off your chest and shoulders in Chapter 29. Transferring Power from Your Rotation to Your Arm Stroke Hopefully you can see how your upper core helps connect your arm stroke to your body. Swimming with good posture forms a strong connection between the two and lets you utilise the larger muscle groups of the chest and upper back to help drive the arm stroke. Swimming with poor posture tends to overload the weaker shoulder muscle groups, which will quickly fatigue. Having a stable upper core, combined with a good catch and rotation technique will really help you to generate some controlled power in the stroke. PAUL: The good news here is that you do not need to be physically strong to swim well, this is one reason why that 11-year-old girl can go zooming past you in the pool with very little upper-body strength. The key is to get in the right positions with a good stroke rhythm and that will produce the necessary power with surprisingly little feeling of force. Developing Better Posture in the Pool At Swim Smooth we like to use drills that involve kicking on your side to improve your posture. Many swimmers have performed similar drills before but normally think of

abdominal area is important in swimming to keep you straight in the water and to help rotate your hips and shoulders together as one. Good core control during swimming has a slightly different feel to it compared to other sports, which can cause some confusion. The key to developing your lower core control is to feel a stretch between your pelvis and rib cage as you swim. In a sense you are trying to separate out the two as much as possible, raising the chest away from the hips. If you try this you will feel your posture improve at the same time as your chest is pushed out and your shoulders come back – great! Warning: avoid holding your breath when you do this. Michael Phelps has one of the best streamline positions in the world. See the Torpedo Kick and Swim Back Drill in Appendix A to see how to get into this position yourself. If you suffer from low-lying legs in the water the first benefit you may notice from improving your core control is that your legs are lifted higher so you slip through the water more easily. That’s a great sign that you’ve made a substantial improvement to your stroke! At Swim Smooth we use several visualisations to help you use your lower core in the right way: --- Page 78 Text --- TORPEDO KICK WITH FINS Kick continuously either on your front or back with your arms above your head in a torpedo position.

The streamlined tuck requires you to stabilise your upper back and also stretches your shoulders and chest. Perform 50 m to 100 m at a time with fins on. Whenever you start any lap of freestyle you are aiming for a nice strong push-off in a streamlined tuck (see Appendix A). This is the perfect time to focus on your lower core using the visualisations below. As you break out in to your freestyle maintain that focus down the lap to integrate the ‘core engagement’ into your full stroke. STICK OF LIQUORICE STRETCH A nice way to think about stretching through the core is to imagine a stick of liquorice that is attached to your pelvis at one end and to your rib cage at the other. As you swim you must keep the liquorice stretched at all times! BUM CHEEK SQUEEZE! A slightly crude visualisation this one – imagine that you have a pound or dollar coin between the cheeks of your backside and to keep it there you must lightly squeeze your glute (buttock) muscles! This exercise also helps you kick more from the hip than the knee as the glute muscles are activated. TILTING PELVIS UPWARDS Think about rotating your pelvis upwards slightly (technical term: anterior tilt) so that your tail-bone is pulled up a little towards your lower back. Think about drawing your rib cage away from your hips as you swim by stretching tall through your core. --- Page 79 Text --- As essential as good lower core control is to your stroke technique, we can easily forget about it when we swim.

good lower core control is to your stroke technique, we can easily forget about it when we swim. An excellent way to remind yourself is to use a good torpedo push-off (also known as a streamline) at the beginning of every length which involves stretching through your core. Doing this will improve the connection between your upper and lower body at the beginning of every length and help remind you to keep that connection and feeling of stretch in place for the whole lap. PAUL: Many of the triathletes who swim with us in Perth think that they don’t need the discipline of a good torpedo push-off at the beginning of every lap because they don’t get to push off in open water. Whilst this is true, they are missing out on developing their core control when swimming which is so essential to avoid fish-tailing (legs sweeping from side to side) and to keep the body high in the water. Dry Land Core Conditioning Most swimmers and triathletes have enough core strength to swim very well, it’s more a matter of coordinating and engaging the core muscles in the right way. Unless you have very poor core strength indeed it’s not normally necessary to add in additional gym classes to your training routine. Saying that, a strong core has many benefits on dry land so we wouldn’t discourage you from a good pilates or yoga class either! Time availability will always be the limiting factor for most non-professional swimmers, so the more specifically you can introduce good core control into your normal swim sessions the better. PAUL: Just to prove this point, it’s normally the gym junkies who can do hundreds of sit-ups who have the worst core control in the water! For more information on dry-land conditioning that you

this misconception can really harm your rotation. Instead you should kick with your rotation: Mr Smooth’s kick also rotates with his body roll. Developing Good Rotation --- Page 82 Text --- To develop your rotation use the Kick-On-Side, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drill sequences from Appendix A as described in Chapter 10 on Swimming Posture. Swimming posture and rotation are heavily related and by swimming with your shoulders back and chest forwards you will naturally drive better rotation into your stroke. PAUL: It should be stressed that when the body rotates with each stroke the head should stay stationary and not move with the rotation of the shoulders (with the obvious exception of rotating to breathe). It is very common to see people move their head around on every stroke when they’re trying to develop their rotation but this adds drag and may cause dizziness or even nausea, especially in turbulent open water. Follow the same process outlined in Chapters 10 and 13 and become accustomed to being on your side, whilst focusing on swimming with good alignment of the lead hand and a good hand position facing downward with the elbow higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips. Kicking in this position may feel very strange to you at first but will build your confidence in it. As you move to the 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills you will get practice at rotating from one side of the body to the other. When you are ready, remove the fins and swim some laps of freestyle focusing solely on maintaining that sensation of reaching and rolling with each stroke, always being mindful of maintaining good alignment and not crossing over.

the fins and swim some laps of freestyle focusing solely on maintaining that sensation of reaching and rolling with each stroke, always being mindful of maintaining good alignment and not crossing over. Focus on stretching forwards with the lead arm as you press the other hand underneath the water towards the hip, with the sensation of needing to rotate this hip out of the way to allow you to finish the stroke off correctly. We’ll revisit this concept of ‘timing the rotation to the arm stroke’ in Chapter 13, which is about how the catch phase affects your rhythm and timing. Rotation and Bilateral Breathing All swimmers rotate a little more on a breathing stroke than a normal stroke. You do this subconsciously to ensure that you get your head in a good position to breathe. Over time this develops a good stroke habit and your rotation becomes good to that side. However, if you only ever breathe to one side (unilateral breathing) then we’ll see your rotation become good to that side but poor to the other. This will give you a lopsided stroke and is one of the major reasons why bilateral breathing is so important for maintaining symmetry in your rotation. The Right Amount of Rotation A great tool to help you monitor your rotation is the Finis Tech Toc. This neat device sits on your lower back, held by a strap around your waist. The Tech Toc has a large ball bearing in it that slides up and down the tube, making a loud ‘click’ when it hits the end. The ball bearing will only slide and hit the end of the tube if you are rotating sufficiently. If you’re struggling to develop your rotation, the Tech Toc is a very worthwhile investment in your swimming.

swimming career. Here are two useful visualisations you can use to help remove a thumb-first entry from your stroke: Visualise hiding your palm from someone watching you from the side of the pool, as if someone’s written a rude word on it! As your hand recovers over the surface of the water you will have a tendency to turn the hand outwards to create the thumb-first position but this would mean showing your palm to that person on the pool deck, don’t do it! Visualise carrying a briefcase in your hand as you recover over the water. You cannot turn your hand outwards because that would mean rotating the briefcase – --- Page 91 Text --- keep it straight as you swim! 2) Hand Entry Point If you stand and hold one arm straight out in front of you and practise entering with the other, the hand should enter somewhere between the wrist and the elbow of the outstretched arm. This is a good guide for most swimmers but some, particularly elite open water swimmers, like to reach a little further forwards before entering into the water. This can be a useful adaptation to make to your stroke for rougher open water swimming. If your other hand was outstretched, the hand should enter somewhere between the distance of your elbow and wrist. Wherever you enter into the water the most important thing is that the hand should spear in cleanly and enter before the elbow. If you overreach and the elbow collapses in first this will harm the catch phase of the stroke that follows. A good exercise for practising a spearing hand entry is the Shoulder Tap Drill shown in Appendix A. With fins on, tap yourself on the shoulder before entering into the water using fingertip-first entry (palm

elbow collapses in first this will harm the catch phase of the stroke that follows. A good exercise for practising a spearing hand entry is the Shoulder Tap Drill shown in Appendix A. With fins on, tap yourself on the shoulder before entering into the water using fingertip-first entry (palm facing down). The shoulder tap slows things down and gives you time to think and to ensure that you are entering from a high position angled downward. As you’ll see in the full drill description, breathe on every single stroke (both to the left and right) when performing Shoulder Tap and leave the other arm outstretched for balance. If you overreach on hand entry you will drop your elbow in first. --- Page 92 Text --- SPEARING FISH VISUALISATION To practice a positive hand entry into the water, imagine there’s a fish swimming in the water around 30 cm or 1 ft in front of you. As you swim, visualise spearing the fish as your enter the water with your hand like the blade of a spear. Enter with a big splash and you scare the fish away and disrupt the smoothness of your stroke. Enter cleanly, smoothly and stealthily and you will catch that fish! This is a simple but powerful way to focus on a clean hand entry and can be used at any time when you’re swimming or racing. A crossover in front of the head is seen in about 70% of attendees on our Swim Smooth Clinics. 3) Alignment Straight in Front of the Same Shoulder As your hand enters the water and extends forwards it should be perfectly in line with your shoulder. This keeps you tracking straight and sets you up for a good catch as you start the following stroke. This sounds simple

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
wrist is important as it will help you initiate the catch itself. If you create too much of a downward angle you will feel your hand pull down towards the bottom of the pool. This is a bit like having your hand out of a car window, changing the angle of your hand in the airflow to pull it up and downward. Experiment with the lead hand in the same way when you are kicking on your side in the pool. --- Page 106 Text --- By aiming to start his catch from very near the surface of the water, Paul C has unwittingly dropped his elbow and from here will have to press down on the water during the initial catch. Spearing forwards a little lower in the position shown will give Paul a much greater use of the effective arc of his catch. Supporting Yourself while Breathing A significant benefit of entering the water and extending forward in this position is that it offers you good support and stability at the front of your stroke. In contrast many swimmers’ lead arms collapse down when breathing, removing any support offered to them. This causes the head to sink and the mouth to drop below the surface, making breathing a real struggle! If you take on water when you swim then introducing a better catch set-up position in your stroke will give you much more support when breathing. Clare’s arm drops down when breathing, giving her very little support. You may find, however, that your arm still wants to drop down as the movement has become a habit.

To help break this, use the mantra 1 - 2 - Stretch as you swim, the 1 and --- Page 107 Text --- 2 on non-breathing strokes and the Stretch when breathing to keep you focused on keeping the lead arm extended and offering you support. Developing Your Catch Step 2: Catch Mechanics The key to a great catch and pull through is to press the water backwards using the hand and forearm as a paddle. Pushing the water downward or to the side harms the catch and wastes a great deal of energy. To help you develop your catch we are going to use three main drills: Scull #1, Scull #2 and Doggy Paddle. Each will help you get a feel for pressing the water backwards in a bent elbow position. PAUL: Any time you struggle to perform a drill I think you should actually look at this as a positive: you’ve simply uncovered an area of your stroke technique or proprioception that needs work and you stand to benefit greatly from working on it! Sculling is a very valuable exercise, which helps to develop your ‘feel for the water’ – learning how the water should feel to you during the catch and how to time the stroke movements to create good propulsion. Most swimmers find sculling challenging at first but that’s OK, follow our pointers carefully and you will soon get better at it. --- Page 108 Text --- SCULL #1 Referring to the full drill description for Scull #1 in Appendix A, push off down the lap with a pull buoy between your legs and raise your head above the surface. Start sculling the water left and right in

Waterpolo with about 15 seconds rest between each 25 m. Immediately transition into 100 m of steady paced swimming focusing on an easy rhythm to the stroke. PULL BUOY AND BANDS Swimming with a pull buoy between your legs and a rubber band around your ankles is a simple way to force you to focus on the rhythm of your stroke. The band holds your feet together eliminating any kick and adds some drag to the back of the stroke. The combination of a lack of kick and the extra drag created by the band forces you to keep the tempo of your stroke high, otherwise your legs will sink down low into the water. Focus on removing any dead spots from your stroke and also stretch through your core using the Liquorice Stretch Visualisation (Chapter 10) to help keep your legs up high. If you are lucky enough to be naturally buoyant and find this an easy drill then increase the difficulty by trying it without a pull buoy! --- Page 116 Text --- Using a Wetronome or Tempo Trainer to Improve Your Stroke Rhythm Wetronomes and Tempo Trainers are small electronic beepers that sit under your swim cap, which you can hear beeping as you swim. To focus on stroke rhythm the beepers are set to beep at a fixed stroke rate – for example 60 strokes per minute (SPM). As you swim, all you need to do is time your strokes to the beep to control your stroke rate precisely. The Finis Tempo Trainer Pro sits under your swim cap and beeps a steady stroke rhythm to you. These stroke beepers are particularly useful for helping you subtly raise or lower your stroke rate. If you have a tendency to fight the water with a large crossover

swimmers. In either case this needs to be rectified because of the high risk of shoulder injury from a thumb-first entry — in fact many Swingers already suffer from shoulder pain for this reason. A hurried catch phase results from a Swinger’s desire to get on and swim at a high tempo. Taking a little longer over the catch will allow the swimmer to get into a better high-elbow catch position and gain a better purchase on the water. Many Swingers have become a little too flat in the water over the years and need to stretch out just a little more in their strokes. The right balance always needs to be struck between stroke length and stroke rate — whilst a Swinger definitely sits towards the shorter faster end of this spectrum it’s possible to take this a little too far and ‘over-rev’. In these cases adding a touch more stroke length is recommended. Sam shows us three common Swinger flaws in one photo: holding breath, thumb-first entry and crossing the centre line underwater. Despite their experience as swimmers, Swingers can be some of the worst culprits when it comes to holding their breath under water. By improving their exhalation technique Swingers should be able to breathe bilaterally quite easily; in fact with their fast stroke rate breathing every five strokes may be an option. For the full Swinger stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 175 Text --- CHAPTER 23 The Smooth --- Page 176 Text --- The Smooth Swim Type is what everybody thinks of when they imagine a long efficient stroke style.

Following this structure helps you to break down a session and attain the right split between the warm-up, drills, heart rate build sets, main sets and cool-downs. In this example we will use a total distance of 3.0 km for the session as an indicator for how much of each component you should look to include. You might normally only cover half this distance in your own training sessions, or you might cover more, in any case use this as a starting guide of what to include and when: The session board for a Swim Smooth squad session at Claremont pool.

Main set totalling 1200 m to 2000 m — this set can focus on different areas, including technique and drills, shorter endurance work, speed sets, threshold development or open water skills. We will look at these more closely in this chapter. 4. Cool-down totalling 100 m to 400 m — this is an important component of any session and should be included as a way of reducing the heart rate, flushing the body of lactate build up and to generally loosen off and feel good in your stroke. Using this simple structure is an easy way to create some wonderfully engaging training sessions. To help get you started with this, in Appendix C we have listed six variations of each component which are loosely aimed at each of the six Swim Types. Use them to construct your own training sessions and so perfectly balance your technique, fitness and open water skills work. You can follow any of the sets for any other Swim Type, they will all be

to become a mantra of our marathon swimming squad! For those swimmers and triathletes attempting longer distance events (e.g. open water events longer than 2.5 km and triathletes training for a full Ironman), long continuous swims are a nice way of building your confidence that you can cover your target race distance. Later in Chapter 27 we will show you how to calculate the pace to hold for these swims so that you develop your base endurance whilst maintaining good form and technique. A classic mistake swimmers make with long continuous swims is to start too fast and then fade towards the end. Breaking down these endurance swims into a series of longer intervals with a short rest in-between will help you maintain focus and motivation and also give you a chance to take on board fluid and nutrition for swims over 45 minutes in length. Fuelling correctly in longer sessions is critical to your successful completion of these sessions and how quickly you recover afterwards. We will cover some specific fuelling strategies for longer swims in Chapter 32. An example of a simple endurance set might be 6 × 400 m at 75% effort with 30 seconds rest between each interval. Instead of thinking of this as 75% effort, you could swim this as ‘threshold pace plus eight seconds per 100 m’. We will look at this form of pace calculation later in Chapter 27. In Appendix C you will find six specific endurance sessions ranging in distance from 2.5 km to 6 km. These are designed to be completed without using one of the additional warm-up and build set suggestions as the warm-up is included within the main body of these sessions and encourages you to start off at a conservative pace as though you were starting a

2.5 km to 6 km. These are designed to be completed without using one of the additional warm-up and build set suggestions as the warm-up is included within the main body of these sessions and encourages you to start off at a conservative pace as though you were starting a longer distance race. We would advise 10—15 minutes of light mobilisation and stretching work as per Chapter 29 before you start these sessions. --- Page 189 Text --- Session Type 3: Threshold or Sustainable Speed Sessions At the heart of any good swim training programme is some dedicated work at threshold speed, often termed ‘race pace’ if your race distance is around 1500 m. Threshold speed is a pace that is tough enough to develop your aerobic capacity but not so strong that significant recovery is required between intervals. Generally speaking, recovery is faster from these sessions than from sets performed at a higher intensity. Developing your ability to swim well at this intensity is a key determinant of how well you will perform in races of 400 m and longer. As we shall see shortly in Chapter 27, we refer to this form of training as ‘CSS’ — short for Critical Swim Speed. PAUL: The ironic thing about this type of training is that as soon as the phrase ‘race pace’ is mentioned by a coach, swimmers act like a red rag to a bull, setting off way faster than they can sustain for the set. Don’t make this mistake yourself, if you do you will soon blow-up and slow down — swimming most of the set at a slower pace than you otherwise could maintain if you had set off at the right pace. If this happens you have greatly harmed the training effect of the session and

using the concept of Functional Threshold Power (FTP) to measure your threshold on the bike in Watts. CSS is the exact same concept but for swimming. In the controlled environment of a swimming pool we don’t need something as fancy as a power meter to measure threshold, it can be defined as a pace per 100 m. As we shall see, rather than performing a 20-minute or 60-minute time trial to find FTP we perform two shorter swims in the pool and perform a calculation to find CSS pace. We recommend performing the CSS test approximately every four weeks to monitor fitness improvements. Once you know your CSS speed (say it is 1:40 / 100 m) you can then calculate your ideal training pace for endurance work (1:48 / 100 m) and for sprint training (1:35 / 100 m). Therefore as your fitness and CSS improves, your whole training plan adapts to keep pushing your fitness forwards. Combining CSS training with an outline skeleton structure (see Chapter 26) provides you with the perfect training routine that has the right mix of training levels, is flexible enough to handle life events and adapts to your fitness levels to keep pushing you forwards. In other words perfect training! Next we will take a look at the test you can use to find your current CSS pace and go on to show you some training sets you can use to improve that pace over time and so become a faster distance swimmer. The CSS Test Follow this procedure to conduct a CSS test: 1. Swim an easy warm-up of between 600 m and 1000 m, including a variety of technique drills and a few short efforts to lift your heart rate. 2. Perform a 400 m time trial from a push (not a

CSS Test Follow this procedure to conduct a CSS test: 1. Swim an easy warm-up of between 600 m and 1000 m, including a variety of technique drills and a few short efforts to lift your heart rate. 2. Perform a 400 m time trial from a push (not a dive), count your laps right and accurately time it! 3. Recover for 10—15 minutes, including some easy laps of swimming to clear waste products from your muscles. 4. Perform a 200 m time trial from a push, again with accurate timing. 5. Easy cool-down. --- Page 199 Text --- ADAM: Remember the anxiety you may feel at the mere mention of the words ‘time trial’! Try to relax during the two swims and see what happens without any preconceptions or pressure. Whatever your times just see them as a stake in the ground at that point in time, the whole idea is that you improve them from here. Some important notes: Remember the test is about your current fitness levels so do not feel tempted to skip the test and put your all-time 200 m and 400 m personal bests into the calculation, unless you have just swum them! Your efforts need to be a true and accurate reflection of what you can currently do for that distance in order to produce a valid CSS figure. Ideally have someone take your splits every 50 m to check your pacing and try to swim each 50 m within a second of the others. Remember that a well-paced effort will feel quite steady at first but build in perceived intensity as it goes on: steady — tempo — hard — very hard. Carefully check that your results make sense, for instance you should have held a faster pace over 200 m than

Text --- When it comes to swimming, a big limiting factor for many triathletes is a lack of flexibility. Poor flexibility can give rise to many stroke technique flaws including crossovers, dropped elbows and sinking legs, all of which will severely limit your potential in the water. Swim, bike and run training keeps us very busy but improving your flexibility doesn’t have to eat into your training time, you can make some big improvements by performing a stretching routine in front of the TV in the evening. In particular, triathletes and swimmers needs to focus on the following areas when stretching: Upper back / shoulders. Hips. Ankles. Studies show that to avoid injury athletes should either stretch regularly or not at all [1] — it tends to be those athletes who stretch every now and again that experience issues with muscle injury and strains. For this reason you should keep stretching regularly to avoid injury and always warm up properly beforehand. Think of your muscles and tendons as a little like toffee — when cold they are brittle and subject to micro-tears if over-stretched, with some gentle mobilisation and warming up they become a lot more pliable. Stretching prior to a training session should only be used to gently loosen off and not to develop muscle length or range of motion. Such work is best left until after training or in a specific stretching session where you warm up beforehand. Stretches should never be painful and should never use a bouncing action. Aim to hold each stretch for approximately 20 seconds and repeat each two to three times. Practise deep controlled breathing while stretching. Stretching: Upper Back and Shoulders Doorway Chest Stretch. Standing in a doorway or beside a post, place your arm in the position shown with your elbow

Stretching: Upper Back and Shoulders Doorway Chest Stretch. Standing in a doorway or beside a post, place your arm in the position shown with your elbow at a right angle. Gently press forwards with your chest and feel the stretch across the front of your shoulder and through the pectoral (chest) muscle. Avoid pushing the shoulder itself too far forward — instead think of drawing your shoulder blades together and back. --- Page 211 Text --- Telescope Arms and Rotation Stretch. This looks complicated but is easy when you get the hang of it! Start by lying on your side with knees bent to approximately 90° and one hand on top of the other. Take a deep breath in and as you exhale rotate the top arm all the way over to open yourself out into a crucifix position whilst following the arm with your gaze. Take a few deep breaths in this position and feel your back and shoulders sinking into the ground with every exhale. This fantastic stretch develops your chest, shoulder and back mobility all in one. Take care to perform it in a slow controlled manner and do not attempt it if you have had any major back problems in the past. --- Page 212 Text --- Triceps and Lats Stretch.

Whilst kneeling, lean forwards with your hands extended out in front of each shoulder. Feel the stretch through the shoulders and chest and underneath the armpits. Hip Flexor Stretch. A lot of time spent sitting at a desk and training on the bike can result in the hip flexor muscles at the front of the hip becoming short. When trying to maintain a horizontal position in the water to reduce drag, this tightness in the hips can pull your legs forward and lower in the water. Regular stretching of the hip flexors will help improve your body position in the water. Settle into the position shown with your lead leg angled 90 degrees at the knee and your rear leg stretched out behind you. Keeping your body vertical and strong, gently push your hips forward and gently squeeze your glutes (your buttock muscles). You will feel the stretch through the front of the hip and possibly into the quadriceps. As a triathlete, think of this as one of your key stretches. --- Page 213 Text --- Seated Ankle Stretch. In the Swim Smooth squads in Perth, we perform very few kick sets with our triathletes, preferring instead to perform drills using a pair of longer flexible flippers, which help to stretch off your ankles. This is a very good use of your time as you develop your stroke using a specific drill and stretch your ankles simultaneously.

Left: Sit on the floor with one leg extended in front and the other bent across the top. Hold the top leg as shown with the hand gently pulling the foot towards you. The stretch is felt through the top of the foot and into the shin. Right: In a kneeling position, place your feet out straight behind you. If you are quite inflexible through the ankles you will feel the stretch through the top of the feet and into the shin. You can lift one knee at a time to develop this stretch further. Avoid this stretch if you have ever had any knee issues. --- Page 214 Text --- Calf and Plantar Fascia Stretch. If you find that you are prone to cramping when wearing flippers then there is a strong likelihood that you are very tight in your calf muscles and in the plantar fascia in the arch of the foot.

Keep your body weight over the foot which is flat on the ground and feel the stretch through the lower calf muscle (soleus). 2. Core Stability and Rehabilitation In Chapter 10 we looked at how you could improve your use of your upper core (shoulders / upper back) and lower core (lower back / abdominal) muscle groups to improve your posture whilst swimming. Here are a few key exercises that you can use at home or in the gym to improve your general conditioning in these areas. Given that core stabilisation training initially requires some skill in order for you to feel the correct muscles activating, we would highly recommend seeking the assistance of a personal trainer or physiotherapist to take you through these exercises. Core stability became very popular in the mid to late 1990s together with an increasing interest in pilates, yoga and the combined ‘yogilates’. Core stability is the interaction of coordination and strength of the abdominal, back and glute muscles during activity to ensure that the spine is stabilised and provides a firm base to support both basic and powerful everyday movements of the arms and legs. Core stability training is an essential component of sport performance and plays a key role in injury prevention. The core muscles are the deepest layer of muscles within the torso and include the abdominals, lower back, buttock and hip muscles, which surround --- Page 215 Text --- the pelvis. Developing a solid foundation within your torso will then allow you to generate powerful movements from your trunk outwards. In a nutshell, core stability: Improves posture. Maintains healthy and balanced muscles. Enhances physical functioning in everyday

Complete three sets of twelve squats. --- Page 217 Text --- Front Plank Place your elbows on the floor shoulder width apart and directly under your shoulders. Supporting yourself on your elbows and toes, be sure your body is in a flat line with no dip or arch in your spine and with your bottom tucked in. Keep your spine neutral and draw in your lower stomach. Hold this position for 20—30 seconds and then rest for 30 seconds, repeating three times. As you get stronger challenge yourself by trying to hold the position for longer each time. The Y-T-W-L Here’s a dry-land exercise we have borrowed from physiotherapists to help you tune into drawing your shoulders together and back (technical term ‘scapular retraction’). We are sure you are familiar with the Village People’s hit song from the 1970s: ‘YMCA’. We are going to do the Y-T-W-L instead! --- Page 218 Text --- Standing in some space, draw your arms up into a Y position beside you. How do they naturally sit? Do they tend to lean forwards like Paul’s position on the left? Maintaining this position, focus on drawing your shoulder blades together and back and notice how your arms come back in line with the body. That’s good posture in action! Avoid arching your lower back as you do this. Run through each of the Y-T-W-L positions, holding each position for around ten seconds; the exercise gets progressively harder to stabilise through the four positions!

Run through each of the Y-T-W-L positions, holding each position for around ten seconds; the exercise gets progressively harder to stabilise through the four positions! The YTWL is a great exercise to add into any stretching and conditioning routine that you have in place. You can practise it immediately before a swim or even between sets in the shallow end of the pool. Over time the YTWL will give you a greater awareness of your posture and help you improve it. In Chapter 30 we will look at some more functional rehab-style exercises for the upper back and shoulders that will help to ward off shoulder injury. --- Page 219 Text --- 3. Strength Training in the Gym When considering introducing traditional gym strengthening exercises into your swimming programme we would encourage you to always ask the question ‘how specific is this exercise to my swimming?’. Swimming is not ordinarily limited by strength in the true sense of the word, which is probably best demonstrated by the example of the 11-year-old girl who so easily cruises past you in the pool and yet would never come close to matching your strength in the gym as an adult. Despite swimming not being limited by strength, some swimmers and triathletes like to add a gym strengthening programme to their routine during the winter months and we would not discourage you from doing so if you are seeking a little general conditioning and toning. We would, however, encourage you to avoid too much emphasis on lifting heavy weights, especially those focused on the muscles at the front of the shoulder and chest (e.g. shoulder and bench press). If performed excessively these exercises can limit mobility in the shoulders and also bring you into a rounded-shoulder posture

however, encourage you to avoid too much emphasis on lifting heavy weights, especially those focused on the muscles at the front of the shoulder and chest (e.g. shoulder and bench press). If performed excessively these exercises can limit mobility in the shoulders and also bring you into a rounded-shoulder posture that could harm your alignment in the pool. In fact, most swimmers and triathletes that we see who have a background in weight training are limited by those two factors: posture and mobility. If you are going to use the gym we suggest you focus your attention on the following exercises that will help maintain and improve your swimming posture: Barbell Row. This exercise focuses on the shoulder and scapular region muscle groups. Use a light weight for this exercise and keep the shoulder horizontal, aiming for 2—3 sets of 12—15 reps with each arm. Lat Pull Down. A great exercise for assisting with good posture and alignment of the upper back. Keep your spine straight when performing this exercise and keep the weight light. Aim for 2-3 sets of 15—20 reps. --- Page 220 Text --- Seated Upright Row. Another excellent exercise for helping you to focus on drawing your shoulder blades together and down when you swim. Keep the spine straight and again use a light weight. Aim for 2—3 sets of 15—20 reps. Travelling Away from Home?

Epub 2006 May 6. --- Page 222 Text --- CHAPTER 30 Prevention and Management of Shoulder Injuries Shoulder pain and injury is very common amongst freestyle swimmers and is caused by repetitive stress placed on the shoulders during each arm stroke. At least 80% of adult swimmers will experience some form of shoulder pain in their swimming lives and such pain should be taken very seriously so that it does not lead to a full-blown injury and time out from swimming. Most elite swimmers train for around 40-70 km per week, which adds up to well over two million strokes per year — that is an awful lot of potential stress on their shoulders. In fact, in elite swimming circles shoulder injury was so common that it used to be considered a fact of swimming life, just something they had to live with. Fortunately these days we understand that the stress on the shoulders is dramatically affected by stroke technique and that by correcting your technique we can greatly reduce stress on the joint, quickly reduce symptoms and go on to cure the condition. An absolutely vital aspect of your preparation as a swimmer is consistency

seen by ultrasound examination. Take Immediate Action --- Page 224 Text --- As soon as you experience any shoulder pain or injury always seek medical advice from a physiotherapist, athletic therapist or sports doctor as soon as possible in order to determine the severity of the injury and to begin rehabilitation. Also immediately reduce or stop training to prevent the pain and swelling from continuing. Resting from activities or movements which aggravate pain is critical and applying ice to reduce inflammation is also key to a successful and fast recovery. Secondly, make sure that you address areas of your stroke technique that can be causing or aggravating the injury using the advice that follows in this chapter. Whilst rehabilitation is important, without addressing your stroke technique an injury could quickly return. Finally, as part of your rehabilitation, introduce the strengthening and stability exercises into your training programme so as to maintain muscle balance around your shoulder joint, which will help to maintain healthy strong shoulders and upper back. Before training always warm-up and stretch lightly but do not over-stretch your shoulders as too much flexibility can also be detrimental. What is the Cause of Shoulder Pain? Shoulder pain is commonly classified into three categories: 1. Shoulder Joint Impingement Shoulder Impingement is a compression or squashing of the structures within the top of the shoulder joint (subacromial space). Within this space lie muscular tendons (e.g. the rotator cuff), and the fluid filled sac that prevents muscle on bone traction (the subacromial bursa). Impingement arises due to the thickening or swelling of the structures within the space or upward migration of the ball in the shoulder joint, caused by having poor posture or poor biomechanics while swimming. 2. Overuse Injury Overuse injuries are generally defined as tendonopathies, which is where there is

common due to the nature of the freestyle stroke and the overuse of the muscles at the front of our shoulders pulling us into a rounded shoulder position. This kyphosis can lead to a loss of flexibility in the thoracic spine which in turn can result in excessive flexibility in our shoulder joints. Thoracic extension and rotation are two exercises which will maintain a flexible thoracic spine and so keep the shoulders free from excessive load. Poor posture at your desk can be problematic for your swimming and the health of your shoulders. Left: Posture is poor due to a slouched position with the chin poked forwards. Middle: Posture is good with a straight, tall back, feet flat on the floor and shoulders back. Right: Good posture is being over-exaggerated which places too much load on the lower back. 1. Thoracic Extension Using a Towel Roll Referring to FIGURE 30.21 place a rolled hand towel on a carpeted floor (1) and lie on your back with the towel under you so that it sits along your spine between your shoulder blades (2). Let your head fall back onto the floor above the towel (if this is --- Page 231 Text --- uncomfortable for your neck you may use a low pillow to support your head). Straighten your legs and let your arms rest by your sides with your palms facing up (3). FIGURE 30.21 Thoracic Extension Using A Towel Roll. Hold this position for two to three minutes and as a progression move your arms over your head in a snow angel fashion to increase the stretch and lengthen out the muscles at the front of the shoulders (4). 2.

a progression move your arms over your head in a snow angel fashion to increase the stretch and lengthen out the muscles at the front of the shoulders (4). 2. Telescope Arms Referring to Figure 30.22 lie on your side with your knees and hips bent to 90° and your arms stretched out, one on top of the other at shoulder height. Begin the stretch by reaching your top hand past your bottom hand as though you are reaching toward the wall in front of you. Keeping your elbow straight and rotating from your trunk upwards (avoiding rolling your hips), reach your arm toward the ceiling and back toward the opposite wall as though you are carving an arc in the air. Your goal is to finish the stretch with your upper shoulder on the floor. Repeat four to six times on each side. FIGURE 30.22 Telescope Arms Exercise --- Page 232 Text --- 3. Scapular Setting Scapular setting is important to re-establish a more balanced position of the humeral head (ball) in the glenoid fossa (socket) thus improving your overall shoulder posture. Sitting upright in a comfortable chair, gently pull your chin in and open your chest. As you do so, imagine pulling the lower part of your shoulder blades together without arching your back or throwing your rib cage forwards. Only a 30%-40% effort should be used to perform this exercise and you should not feel any tension in your shoulder blades or neck. Keep breathing normally and aim to hold the position for 1-2 minutes until it becomes comfortable, then aim to hold it for longer periods during the day. FIGURE 30.23 Develop an improved posture using Scapular Setting. Do not overexaggerate the position and arch the lower back (right). --- Page 233 Text --- Repeat this

aim to hold the position for 1-2 minutes until it becomes comfortable, then aim to hold it for longer periods during the day. FIGURE 30.23 Develop an improved posture using Scapular Setting. Do not overexaggerate the position and arch the lower back (right). --- Page 233 Text --- Repeat this exercise frequently throughout the day in sitting and standing positions. As a progression try the same position lying on your front with your arms at your side, this will allow you to train these muscles in a prone posture similar to swimming. 4. Shoulder Shrugs Shoulder shrugs address weakness in the upper trapezius muscle, which is often seen when the shoulder on one side is depressed or sits lower, this is normally the shoulder experiencing shoulder pain. Start by standing with your arm slightly away from your body, elbow straight and your palm facing forward (1). Set your shoulder as in the previous Scapular Setting exercise and hold this position. Gently shrug your shoulder toward your ear, hold for 1- 2 seconds (2) before lowering. Repeat three sets of the exercise, each with 10-12 repetitions. As a progression you can add a light hand weight if control allows (3 and 4). Start with 1 kg and progress to 3 kg. FIGURE 30.24 Shoulder Shrugs with and without weights. --- Page 234 Text --- 5. Seated Row Using Theraband A seated row aims to strengthen the muscles at the back of the shoulder between the shoulder blades, which help to stabilise the scapula and improve overall shoulder position and biomechanics. Use a piece of theraband anchored to a door knob or railing at belly button height, stand or sit holding one end of the band in each hand with it taut and slightly stretched in front of you.

the scapula and improve overall shoulder position and biomechanics. Use a piece of theraband anchored to a door knob or railing at belly button height, stand or sit holding one end of the band in each hand with it taut and slightly stretched in front of you. Start with your elbows straight and shoulders slightly rounded (1 and 3). Leading with your elbows pull your hands toward you bringing them toward the outside of your chest (2). As you pull the band to your chest gently pull your shoulder blades together (4). Repeat three sets of 10-12 repetitions each. As a progression increase repetitions to 15-20 and then increase the resistance by using a stronger theraband. --- Page 235 Text --- FIGURE 30.25 Seated Row Using Theraband. 6. External Shoulder Rotation with Theraband This external shoulder rotation exercise focuses on improving strength in the back of the shoulder primarily in the rotator cuff muscles. This exercise helps to re-balance the rotator cuff muscles and improve the position of the humeral head (ball) in the glenoid fossa (socket). Anchor one end of a piece of theraband to a door knob and stand with your unaffected shoulder beside the door. Hold the end of the theraband on your affected side and stand so that the band is taut with your elbow bent to 90° and your upper arm along your side. Your wrist should be level with the door knob. Set your shoulder as in Exercises 2 and 3 and then gently pull the band away from your mid-line pivoting at your elbow. Repeat three sets of 10-12 repetitions of this exercise. As a progression increase to 15-20 repetitions then increase the resistance by using a stronger theraband. FIGURE 30.26 External Shoulder Rotation Using Theraband. --- Page 237 Text --- CHAPTER 31

of each length very effectively. Tumble turns save you time and also maintain the flow and rhythm of your stroke better than a touch turn but they are by no means compulsory in any squad session. Many swimmers worry about the disorientation of being upside down whilst trying to coordinate a roll over in the water or fear bashing their legs on the side of the pool from being too close. Instead aim to swim in positively, achieve a tight tuck and firm foot plant on the wall — confidence is the key to a successful tumble. FIGURE 31.27 A great tumble turn has the above steps. --- Page 239 Text --- 1. Approach the turn with confidence but avoid lifting the head too high or out of the water completely to ‘spot’ the wall (a very common mistake for beginners). 2-3. You should commence your turn between the black ‘T’ on the floor of the pool and the wall, i.e. about 1m (3 ft) away — if you really stretched out with one hand you should just about be able to touch the wall. 3. Tuck your chin into the chest and bring your arms down by your sides. 4-5. Think about getting into the tightest, smallest ball that you can — this will help you flip over faster than if you stay outstretched. Bring your knees into your chest. At this point if you were to open out you’d be perfectly on your back. Start bringing your hands back above your head. 6. Keep the knees, ankles and feet together and aim to plant them firmly on the wall with your toes pointing to either 10 o’clock or 2 o’clock on the wall. Note: you do not have to attempt to add in a full twist at this

back above your head. 6. Keep the knees, ankles and feet together and aim to plant them firmly on the wall with your toes pointing to either 10 o’clock or 2 o’clock on the wall. Note: you do not have to attempt to add in a full twist at this point so that your feet would be pointing to 6 o’clock. 7. Aim to make contact with the wall with your knees bent at about 90° — much more or less than this and you will struggle to get a good drive off the wall. 8. As you drive off the wall, strive to stretch out in a full torpedo (streamlined) position. Add in a few freestyle flutter kicks or dolphin (butterfly) kicks to emphasise your speed off the wall and rotate fully back onto your front. 9. Maintain the streamlined torpedo and aim to break out into your full stroke at about 5 m (15 feet) from the wall. Dives Some swim squads like to finish a session with some sprints from the deep end of the pool from a dive start — these are great fun and they sharpen up your pool skills. --- Page 240 Text --- Whilst not compulsory, learning to dive properly can be a lot of fun and if you are planning on racing in the pool it will really give you a good advantage especially in the shorter sprint events. IMPORTANT: Always ensure that you check the depth of water that you are diving into and that there are no foreign obstacles or other swimmers that might get in your way and cause you harm. There is a risk of neck and spinal injury from diving into any body of water but if the depth is greater than 1.8 m (6 ft) and

commence a powerful kick to maintain your speed before breaking out into your full stroke just as per any normal push-off. In our Swim Smooth Perth squad sessions we perform very little of the other three competitive strokes: butterfly, backstroke and breaststroke. Whilst these strokes can benefit your freestyle by developing better muscular balance across the body, if you are only swimming two or three times per week and training for a triathlon or open water swimming event, we would advise you to keep your training as specific as possible and focus on mastering the freestyle stroke. However, it is still useful to know some tips on performing the other three strokes and using them in your warm-ups, and particularly cool-downs, as a good way to vary your programme. Butterfly — often seen as the hardest competitive stroke, butterfly can be challenging because it requires excellent rhythm and timing, good flexibility and a strong leg kick. The stroke undulates around the short axis of the spine and in this respect is more similar to breaststroke than freestyle and backstroke. The best way of visualising a good butterfly stroke is to think of yourself moving through the water like a dolphin. Both arms work together above and below the water with a more rounded recovery than in freestyle — probably one of the reasons why many Swingers are good at butterfly! You do need to be cautious, however, as the lack of long axis rotation in butterfly can increase the load on your shoulders so you should limit the volume of butterfly in your programme. Performing butterfly with fins is a great way to develop a feel for the undulated action of the stroke, it can also tone up your midsection and when done gently can help to --- Page 242

on your shoulders so you should limit the volume of butterfly in your programme. Performing butterfly with fins is a great way to develop a feel for the undulated action of the stroke, it can also tone up your midsection and when done gently can help to --- Page 242 Text --- loosen off a tight lower back. The key to a good butterfly stroke is to ensure that as your head comes up out of the water to take a breath, you do this quickly and focus on getting your chin down onto your chest as quickly as you can. This will help the torso dive back down into the water and assist the arms with their recovery over the top of the surface. The key to butterfly is to breathe and then quickly drop your chin back down onto your chest. Backstroke — very similar to freestyle with respect to long axis rotation, backstroke is effectively the reverse of freestyle and is often used as a way of stretching out during a cool-down and working the muscles in the opposite direction. To be good at backstroke having a strong leg kick is essential. If you don’t have a strong kick and want to try some of the beneficial aspects of the stroke then try wearing a pair of fins. Another important feature of backstroke is to keep your head back. We often tell the children who we work with to imagine that they have to keep their noses in the air like a ‘posh’ person would walk around. This stops the common mistake of bringing the chin towards the chest, which causes the swimmer to sit up in the water and drop the legs and buttocks down low. Breaststroke — whilst used by many swimmers who cannot swim

If you’re going to use an oil based lubricant, make sure that you take the time to clean it off properly after your race as it can degrade the material and shorten the life of the suit. ADAM: Don’t fight against the suit, work with it. Try altering your arm recovery over the top of the water to a straighter arm style as we did with Kate, this will avoid tension and premature fatigue in the deltoids. If your arms and shoulders become tired when swimming in a suit are you trying to swim with a classic high- elbow recovery? The solution to this problem isn’t to get in the gym and build up your strength as the extra muscle bulk may actually make the problem worse. Instead, work on a relaxed but straighter arm recovery style. As a bonus this will help give you greater arm clearance over the surface in rougher conditions. Open your elbow angle out in a wetsuit to create a straighter arm recovery, thereby avoiding wetsuit fatigue. PAUL: In some open water swimming and warm water triathlon events around the world ‘swim skins’ like the Blue Seventy Point Zero Three (TX) are still allowed. These suits are like a very thin wetsuit which provide marginal buoyancy benefits, warmth, sun protection and also enhance proprioceptive control through the core abdominal region. The surface of the suit is also aqua-phobic meaning that you slide through the water very easily. We have tested them extensively in the warm waters here in Perth and have found them to be amazingly quick. If your budget will stretch to one we’d highly recommend them for warm water swims. --- Page 275 Text --- CHAPTER 39 Adapting Your Stroke to a Variety of Conditions PAUL: In February 2011 I took a group

waters here in Perth and have found them to be amazingly quick. If your budget will stretch to one we’d highly recommend them for warm water swims. --- Page 275 Text --- CHAPTER 39 Adapting Your Stroke to a Variety of Conditions PAUL: In February 2011 I took a group of our Swim Smooth Perth squad swimmers down to the 4 km Busselton Jetty Swim, a three hour drive south of Perth. This is one of the most popular open water swims on the calendar and conditions are usually relatively flat. The Busselton Jetty is the longest jetty in the southern hemisphere and extends just under 2 km out to sea with a slight kink in the middle. Navigation in this event is relatively simple – keep the jetty on your left side all the way out to the end, swim round the very end of the jetty before returning on the other side, still keeping the jetty on your left. Simple. On this particular year though a strong wind had stirred the Indian Ocean up considerably with a significant swell running from right to left across the course as you looked out to sea. It made for extremely challenging conditions such that it was nearly impossible to breathe to the right on the outward leg and equally impossible to breathe to the left on the return leg. Attempting to breathe towards the direction of the oncoming swell resulted in a nasty mouthful of salty water! Those swimmers unable to adapt their breathing patterns were at a severe disadvantage, which saw over 60% of the field withdraw from the race. Just three days before the event I had set a training session for my swimmers of 15 × 100 m with 20 seconds rest between each. The goal was to

specialist paddles allow the hand to stay in a natural relaxed position. These paddles also leave the fingertips in the waterflow which helps maintain feel whilst still reducing the effective area. Kicking With A Board is used by junior and Masters squads to develop a swimmer’s kick power. Most adult swimmers do not have the ankle flexibility to kick well with a board as the lift at the front worsens the working angle of the foot against the water – in many cases reducing propulsion to zero. If you are keen on introducing some kick work into your training then we recommend kicking without a board in a torpedo position unless you have very flexible ankles. In the Swim Smooth squads in Perth we perform very few dedicated kick sets. Instead, the kicking performed using fins during drills helps to stretch off the --- Page 283 Text --- swimmer’s ankles and bring their legs into a better kicking position. This, combined with specific use of the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick And Swim Back drills, is our preferred approach to improving an adult swimmer’s kick. As discussed in Chapter 9, for adult swimmers tackling distance swimming events, we are not normally looking to create much kick propulsion. The objective is to improve their kick technique so that the legs are lifted high and together with minimum effort and produce the propulsion from the arm stroke combined with body rotation instead. Sink Downs Exhaling constantly through your mouth or nose as you swim is an essential skill for efficient freestyle.

as you swim is an essential skill for efficient freestyle. Exhaling constantly sounds easy but can be a challenge to get the feel of to begin with, especially if you have many years of holding your breath underwater behind you. --- Page 284 Text --- To help develop your exhalation technique use this sink down exercise at the deep end of your pool. Sink downs are an excellent way to start your swimming session, even before your warm-up. Tread water and take a breath before bringing your arms down by your side and start exhaling into the water. You’re aiming to sink straight down to the bottom without any pauses or delays. Experiment between exhaling from your mouth and nose to see which is most natural to you. Tipping Point When you exhale you may find that you struggle to sink or that you might sink a little and then come back up to the surface. That’s a sign that you’re not exhaling quickly --- Page 285 Text --- enough and that perhaps you are subconciously holding on to your breath. If you initially sink a little but then immediately return to the surface don’t give up, keep exhaling! You will find that you pass through a tipping point and then start to sink down again. As you continue to practise your sink downs aim to get to this point more quickly and sink straight down without the initial delay near the surface. Relaxation The key to getting rid of the air in your lungs is relaxation, if you’re anxious in the water then this will hold you back from exhaling properly. Imagine you’ve had a stressfull day at work and you get home and collapse onto the couch with a big sigh. That is exactly the feeling you’re aiming

tall as you can to produce the tuck. If you are flexible enough you should be able to tuck your arms behind your head. Kick Development Sequence From the end of the lane push off in your torpedo tuck and kick as hard as you can until you run out of air. Aim to be about 50 cm or 1½ ft under the water as you kick along. When you run short of air stop and tread water for a few seconds to catch your breath. Then swim easy freestyle back to the wall that you came from: kick gently and simply focus on tapping your big toes as they pass. How does your body position feel when swimming back? Higher? Do you feel like you’re cutting through the water more easily? Be careful not to over-kick when swimming back, compared to the hard kick during the torpedo it will feel like nearly no kick at all! --- Page 289 Text --- Kicking Focus Repeat this exercise through, each time using one of the following focuses as you streamline and kick: --- Page 290 Text --- Turn your toes inwards slightly and lightly brush them together as they pass. Squeeze your backside as if you have a coin between your bum cheeks! Stretch through the core, stretching your rib cage away from your hips. Think about tiliting your pelvis upwards slightly (as if lifting your backside towards your lower back). Which felt best to you? Which created the most propulsion? Move on to swimming 200 m easy freestyle thinking solely about your chosen focus. You can return to your chosen visualisation any time you swim if you feel as though your stroke is becoming ragged.

Broken Arrow drill is designed for swimmers with tight shoulders and upper backs to help them loosen off. It’s a derivative of the 6-1-6 drill and should always be performed wearing fins. --- Page 297 Text --- As in 6-1-6, kick on the side but without delay take the top hand and raise it up vertically over your head and pause it there for two seconds. This is your ‘arrow’. After pausing for a second, break the arrow by bending at the elbow and then spear into the water in front of the head. Rotate on to the other side and breathe before returning your head to the water and lifting your arm on that side. The mantra of the drill is: up - break - spear in - breathe - up - break - speak in - breathe. Whilst your arm is vertical, think about sinking your arm down into the shoulder socket for two seconds before breaking the arrow. This helps you to improve your swimming posture by engaging your scapular. When you have a feel for the rhythm of Broken Arrow, maintain a focus on your lead hand, keeping it straight and aligned by drawing your shoulders back and together. --- Page 298 Text --- Using Broken Arrow You can swim Broken Arrow at any time but as with Shoulder Tap, it’s a perfect drill to add to your warm-up to help you loosen off your shoulders. A good warm-up is: 200 m easy freestyle 300 m with fins as 3x: {50 m Broken Arrow + 50 m freestyle} 100 m easy freestyle with pull buoy --- Page 299 Text --- Popov The Popov drill is used to develop your body rotation and a classic high elbow arm recovery.

entry into the water from a high angle : e.g. 4 × 100 m as: 50 m Shoulder Tap + 50 m freestyle When transitioning to freestyle, imagine a small fish is swimming just in front of you in the water. As you recover the arm and enter into the water you’re aiming to spear the --- Page 301 Text --- fish just in front of your head. This visualisation will help you to develop the positive spearing entry you need in your stroke. Shoulder Tap can help loosen off your shoulders too, which makes it an excellent drill to include in your warm-up. Doggy Paddle Doggy Paddle is perhaps the oldest drill in the book but it’s a great one none the less! This version is swum with more rotation than kid’s doggy paddle and is known as ‘long-dog’ in some parts of the swimming world. Doggy Paddle is a powerful drill for developing your catch and ‘feel for the water’ as it forces you to develop an early bent elbow catch. Performing the drill with a straight --- Page 302 Text --- arm catch, which many swimmers use in their full stroke, is nearly impossible! If you struggle to perform the drill it’s likely that you are in the habit of catching the water with a straight arm, in which case this drill will be very useful for you indeed. Performing Doggy Paddle As with sculling drills, always use a pull buoy with Doggy Paddle to avoid any assistance from the legs. Push off from the wall and start performing strokes, returning the recovering arm forwards underwater. This underwater recovery might feel odd at first. Don’t worry too much about your return path, simply slip the hand forwards fingertips first as easily as you can. Emphasise ‘reaching over

the drill, transition into a set of short fast efforts swum with a fast stroke rate. For example: 2 × 25 m Waterpolo drill at 90% effort 2 × 25 freestyle at 90% effort – emphasise rhythm 2 × 25 m Waterpolo drill at 90% effort 2 × 25 freestyle at 90% effort – fast rhythmical stroke Swimming with Bands Swimmming with bands is another drill which focuses on delivering better rhythm and timing to your stroke. Wearing a band around your ankles stops you kicking and also adds a little drag to the back of your stroke, which will want to pull your legs downward. For most swimmers we recommend using a pull buoy between your legs at the same time but if you have good natural buoyancy you can perform the drill without one. Swim normal freestyle with your upper body and swim with a high stroke rate, getting into your catch quickly. Stretch tall through your core, lifting your rib cage away from your hips as much as possible. Swim short distances at a time such as 25 m or 50 m. This drill never feels easy as everyone’s legs sink to a greater or lesser extent. The key is to keep your legs as high as possible during the drill by using a good stroke rhythm and a stretched core. When you transition back to normal swimming you’ll have a heightened awareness of your body position and stroke rate. --- OCR from Page 312 Image 2 --- hey --- Page 313 Text --- You can experiment with your stroke whilst wearing a band to see the effect it has on your body position. Try: Pushing down on the water during the catch with a straight arm. Pushing the water forwards as if overgliding and putting on

elbow recovery requires good flexibility and range of motion in these two areas and does not suit some swimmers with limited range of movement. See Chapter 11. 7. Try lowering your stroke rate slightly, ideally using a stroke-rate beeper such as a Wetronome or Tempo Trainer Pro. Lowering your natural stroke rate by 3–5 strokes per minute is not a huge change but gives you time to lengthen out your stroke and develop that body rotation in conjunction with step 4. 8. Use a regular stretching routine to loosen off your shoulders, upper back, hip flexors and ankles. These four areas are restricted in many Arnies and making even small improvements in your flexibility will pay real dividends for your swimming. See Chapter 29. Experiment with a range of head positions to see which works best for you. Head Position Many Arnies have been told to look straight down when they swim to help bring their legs up. As discussed in Chapter 8, this is an option for you but we encourage you to keep a more neutral head position if possible as it help you to develop your catch and --- OCR from Page 316 Image 1 --- = ri "TE REEELE LEE. TES NN = sttees Bevis: FIPS 2 aaleitae --- Page 317 Text --- your navigation in open water. Only look straight down if you cannot lift your body position right up using the process listed above. Kick Timing As discussed in Chapter 9 there are two main ways of kicking in swimming, a 6-beat kick or a slower 2-beat kick. You may have heard about the efficiency benefits of using a 2-beat kick but for most Arnies with low-lying legs a light 6-beat kick will suit you much better as it will help to keep your

coordinate at first but that’s OK. A weak point in a Bambino’s stroke is that their lead arm slips down in the water when breathing, when in fact it should be out in front of the head offering support. As you perform the 6-1-6 drill you may find that the lead arm wants to collapse down as the top arm comes over during the arm stroke. If this happens practise using a Vitamin tube as a relay baton, as described in Appendix A. Move on to 6-3-6, all the time catching up for the moment with your arms in front of your head. You should immediately notice more support when breathing. Developing a good exhalation technique is critical to helping you relax in the water. 4. Reinforce your stroke timing by repeating the 1-2-stretch mantra to yourself as you swim. The 1 and 2 being on normal strokes and the stretch on a breathing stroke, this will help to remind you to keep that lead hand out in front of you for support whilst breathing. You should be able to let your breath take care of itself whilst you think about keeping that lead hand stable. --- Page 319 Text --- 5. Work on your head position whilst breathing using the Popeye Breathing and Split Screen visualisation described in Chapter 7. You are aiming to keep your head low in the water and breathe into the bow-wave trough. If you have tried this before it will be much more achievable now that we have improved your stroke timing in steps 3 and 4. 6. Develop a basic ‘feel for the water’ using the Scull #1 drill. You may well find sculling quite a challenging exercise at first but that’s OK, this is highlighting a bit of a hole in your

of this book. If you have a strong sprint background, this type of threshold-based training at CSS pace (Critical Swim Speed) when combined with a lap interval beeper like the Wetronome or Finis Tempo Trainer Pro can really add an exciting and motivating element to your sessions, especially if you find it hard to find anyone to swim with who can push you along at your pace. Set yourself some challenging targets for a set of 200 m intervals for example (e.g. 2:24 / 200 m) and dial in the Wetronome to beep every 18 seconds. Simply aim to be at each 25 m marker each time the beep goes and without realising it you will be half way through a really rewarding hard-fitness set trying to make sure that the little beeper does not get ahead of you! This adds in an element of pace awareness and is very much a technique set in itself – can you survive the entire set holding good form without blowing up? The format for these types of sessions is only limited by your imagination and we have included some of our favourites for you in Appendix C. ∗These distances are our best recommendations for completing this exercise in a 50 m pool – if you are swimming in a 25 m or 25 yd pool, try halving the suggested distances or ensure that your turn is quick and does not disrupt your focus on your catch. --- Page 333 Text --- APPENDIX C Training Sessions About These Training Sessions To create a training session, pick from the training sets in this guide.

C Training Sessions About These Training Sessions To create a training session, pick from the training sets in this guide. We’ve provided six of each type to choose from: Warm-up. Build sets. Technique focused main sets. Fresh and fruity (CSS). Long endurance sets (suitable for Ironman and long distance open water swimmers). Sprint sets. Open water skills sets. Cool-downs. Each type of set is available as one of six themes: 1. Something Classically Simple (aimed loosely at Arnies). 2. Something Relaxing (aimed loosely at Bambinos). 3. Something A Little Different (aimed loosely at Kicktastics). 4. Something More Technical (aimed loosely at Overgliders). 5. Something Rhythmical (aimed loosely at Swingers). 6. Something Smooth (aimed loosely at Smooths). Pick a set that suits your Swim Type or your mood and ‘mix and match’ with other sets to create a whole session. The endurance sets stand alone as sessions by themselves but for everything else construct your session as a sequence of: Warm-up set. Build set. Main set chosen from: technique, fresh and fruity (CSS), sprint or open water skills. Cool-down set. In total there are over 5,000 combinations to experience!

order is ranked from fastest to slowest. In events with more participants than lanes, the competition is conducted in mul- tiple rounds or “heats.” Either heats are used to seed swimmers for the final, or heats are pregrouped to put swimmers of similar speed in the same heat, and the best time from any heat wins the race. These can be used to determine seeding for finals or so that similar-speed swimmers all swim together, and the heats are timed with the fastest swimmer being declared the winner. It has become easier to compare times from different heats thanks to the development of sophisticated timing equipment, standardized and certified pool lengths, and touch pads that automatically stop a clock when a swimmer makes contact. xiii smroftalp gnitratS m 31.2 m 92.81 Figure 1 A 25-meter pool. --- Page 15 Text --- The Sport of Swimming geTTing STArTed: APPArel In order to learn the sport of swimming and train effectively for competition, you need certain kinds of gear. For starters, choosing the right suit can be an important part of both your appreciation of swimming and your comfort in the water. Many types of modern swimsuit are available in different fabrics and cuts. Something that you might wear to the beach is not necessarily the best choice for a swimming workout, since beachwear is designed more for fashion than for function. Swimsuits, on the other hand, have evolved to maximize fit and functionality. Swimsuits Unlike ancient swimmers, modern contestants are of course required to wear some sort of swimsuit. Suit design has changed dramatically over the years, and today males typically opt for a brief or “jammer,” which runs from waist to just above the knee. These formfitting suits are typically made of a material that stretches, such as nylon, spandex,

course required to wear some sort of swimsuit. Suit design has changed dramatically over the years, and today males typically opt for a brief or “jammer,” which runs from waist to just above the knee. These formfitting suits are typically made of a material that stretches, such as nylon, spandex, polyester, or a combination thereof. Females typically wear a one-piece suit that covers the body from the mid-thighs to the shoulders; suits vary in style and cut. For training purposes, swimmers may opt to use any of a variety of suits that are less expensive or less restrictive or provide some extra element for training purposes, such as the increased drag of looser suits. Goggles Goggles have been around for a long time but came into widespread use only in the 1970s; they are now considered an integral part of sport swimming. For several reasons, goggles come in many styles. How does one know which style to buy? Some styles are geared toward a particular activity, such as scuba diving, snorkeling, or triathlon, and others are available in different sizes, shapes, and tints. Quality should be assessed on the basis not of price but of fit. The best goggles are the ones that fit you—that is, the ones that fit your face comfortably and keep the water out. Remember, their purpose is to enhance your vision and reduce eye irritation from pool chemicals or, in open-water environments, other sources. To test the fit, place the eyepieces on your eye sockets, below the bony part where the eyebrows are located, in the softer part of each socket. Without using the strap, press the goggles gently onto this soft tissue and see if they stay even for just a few seconds; if they do, you have a good fit! The strap merely

measure of protection from xiv --- Page 16 Text --- The Sport of Swimming the sometimes-harsh chemicals or other environmental factors in the water. These environmental factors can include the sun when outside, bacteria in the water, and other chemicals in the water—such as a residual-like suntan lotion that came off other swimmers, runoff from chemicals on the deck when it rains, or other chemicals from pollution that can be found in open-water environments. Swim caps are made often of latex, silicone, or (for very cold water) neoprene; they vary in style and price. If you decide to wear a cap, take care to choose one that works for you. Cap sizing tends to be one-size-fits-all, but small differences do exist from brand to brand. Keep in mind that, like rubber bands, caps can stretch and break; they typically include a care-and-use guide in their packaging. geTTing STArTed: TrAining equiPmenT In swimming, training equipment is often used to conduct drills and improve swim- ming-specific movements by increasing resistance. It can also serve as an assistive device that enables swimmers to isolate a specific movement or set of skills. Such equipment is not necessary for the sport, but it can make many skills and drills easier to master and perfect. At many facilities, equipment is made available to patrons, thus enabling you to test out the gear and learn what to look for if you choose to pur- chase your own. Common equipment used in swimming includes kickboards, fins, paddles, pull buoys, and snorkels. Kickboards The kickboard (figure 2) is a fairly common piece of equipment found in many swim- mers’ training bags. It is typically made of some sort of foam to provide flotation. Its purpose is to provide a buoyancy assist so that swimmers can isolate and train the

progression involves bringing your hands in to the sides of your body. As you become more comfortable with this balanced position, you can try a more advanced floating technique. From your sides, bring your hands up above your head, stretching to the longest possible position (figure 1.3). This is a more advanced floating skill, and succeeding at it is a major accomplishment; in fact, some people who have difficulty mastering it still go on to become very accomplished swimmers. Once you have mastered these skills, it is time to practice them with modifications and drills. Figure 1.3 Back FloaTing in a sTraighT line Preparation Execution 1. Begin by checking the water 1.

water (figure 1.4). You can try this first exercise while holding your breath. One indicator of success is being able to look straight down at the bottom of the pool while relaxing on the water in a horizontal position with your back straight. After you become comforta- ble in this position, try it again—only this time breathe out slowly. Breath holding causes tension, which can lead a swimmer to sink or struggle with balance; exhaling slowly, on the other hand, aids relaxation and is also a necessary skill for performing the competitive strokes. To control your breathing, rather than exhaling forcefully, breathe out through your nose while humming. 8 --- Page 28 Text --- Floating Figure 1.4 FronT FloaTing WiTh arms exTended Preparation Execution 1.

CorreCtion This problem result comes from curling the back too much. Keep your spine straight and your limbs relaxed and out away from the body for balance. Once you are able to perform this skill successfully for at least a few seconds, it is time to move on to more advanced floating skills. Front Floating in a T Position The next part of this progression takes away some of the surfaces that swimmers use for balance. As with floating on your back, the next skill to master is floating on your front while bringing your legs together. Specifically, repeat the same skill, but this time keep your arms out while bringing your legs together to make a T rather than a starfish (figure 1.5). This skill requires a little more control and ability to relax on the water. Figure 1.5 Front Floating in a t Position Preparation Execution 1. Begin by checking the water 1.

balance and a solid foundation that ena- bles you to apply force to the water. As discussed earlier, it is critical to locate your center of balance and be comfortable in the water. Return for a moment to the teeter-totter analogy and the fact that your center of buoyancy lies in the middle of your chest. If you stand poolside with your arms at 14 --- Page 34 Text --- Floating your sides, about two-thirds of your personal teeter-totter—that is, everything from your chest to your feet—lies below your center of buoyancy. In order to achieve a good swimming position, you need to bring the teeter-totter back into balance. To that end, as soon as you raise your arms above your head, about half of your length is above your center of buoyancy and the other half is below it. There is a time when the body is extended in this fashion in each of the four competitive strokes. Finding Your Balance on Your Back If starting with the back float, the objective is to raise your arms above your head and stretch them as far as you can. Be as long as you can from fingertips to toe tips and still maintain a good floating position. Note that in this position, you have very few ways to manipulate the water for lateral balance. Learning balance in this position can prove challenging for people with limited flexibility or limited range of motion in the shoulders. You have succeeded when you can maintain a relaxed floating posi- tion with your hands extended beyond your head. Use the following steps to find your balance while floating on your back.

Streamlined Floating on Your Back The next skill in floating on your back is to establish a streamlined position (figure 1.7)—one in which you are not only as long as you can be (from fingertips to toe tips) but also as skinny as possible. This streamlining reduces drag force (discussed in step 2) and sets you up to move through the water more effectively in later stages of the learning process. A good streamline involves certain key elements—extending the body into a line as long as possible from fingertips to toe tips, keeping the core tight, and making yourself as skinny as possible—starting at the fingertips and working down from there. 15 --- Page 35 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 1.7 sTreamlined FloaTing on your Back Preparation Execution 1.

Your feet and toes should be pointed much like those of a ballet dancer; the exact degree of angle depends on the flexibility of your ankles. Streamlined Floating on Your Front The streamline on the front (figure 1.8) is produced in the same manner as on the back; it is more challenging, however, because your face is in the water. In both posi- tions, success is measured by how well you maintain both the horizontal position in the water and the long, stretched-out position with no movement.

Its purpose is to set up a good swimming position and minimize the drag force that slows you down and makes it harder to perform each movement. You will learn more about streamlining in later steps; for now, here are some drills to help you begin to master it. Streamline Drill 1 shadow streamlines This drill is done out of the pool and is good for both front and back streamlines.

now start by ensuring that you are as long and narrow (i.e., as rocketlike) as possible. In order to feel the effects of drag and minimize their influence, repeat the push-off drill but add some new elements, starting with the manner in which you push off. The following few instructions provide a sequence that not only helps you under- stand how drag affects swimming but also reinforces your ability to balance in the water (figure 2.1). For the first part of this sequence, position yourself in shallow water at the pool wall. This is the only time in the sequence that you will get to push against something solid, so make it count! Tips for MiniMizing Drag 1. Posture is important. Make yourself as long as you can, from fingertips to toe tips. Doing so includes really stretching and pointing your toes! 2. Avoid the “Superman flying position” in which your hands are separated and your arms are parallel to each other. If you are trying to be narrow, stack your hands one on top of the other as in the Torpedo drill in step 1. A point at the front and at the back is best. Hydrodynamics tells us that you want to be long and skinny so pierce the water and let it flow off a single point at the end as well. 3. Your head is your rudder. If you keep your head down and your neck long, you will go farther. This position is also worth practicing for another reason: it is not far from your ideal front-swimming position. 22 --- Page 42 Text --- Manipulating the Water Figure 2.1 MiniMizing Drag a b Preparation Execution 1.

catch phase (figure 2.2), in which the key surface (whether in the form of one hand or both hands) enters the water and begins to get perpendic- ular to the direction in which you are going. For a mental representation of the catch phase, swimmers think about anchoring the hand in the water, which hinges on three factors. The first factor involves water movement. Turbulent water (as in a washing machine) makes it hard to establish an anchor since the water is already moving. To minimize this problem, find water that is not disturbed in front of you and stretch to reach it. The second factor involves the pitch or angle of the hand(s). Recall that it is almost always best to put pressure on the water in a direction perpendicular to your direction of travel. As a general rule, your fingers should almost always be pointed slightly down on each stroke in order to encourage at least your hand to be perpendicular to your direction of travel. The last factor is strength. If you do not yet have the strength to hold the water, your hand will waffle through it. Alternatively, being unable to hold the water may relate to bad balance, which can weaken the propulsive force enough that it does not overcome the drag force. Both of these issues can be corrected over time through practice. 24 --- Page 44 Text --- Manipulating the Water Figure 2.2 Basic caTch Preparation 1.

Using only your kicking skill, kick toward the wall with your hands stretched out so that your fingertips touch the wall first.

feel your hands being pressed toward the wall. c In the first few parts of this progression, you have developed a mental image and achieved a horizontal position in the water using your legs to maintain your balance. The next part is to make sure that the kick you are developing is propulsive. You should be in the same extended streamlined position that you developed in step 1. If your hands are grabbing the wall and hanging on instead of being pushed toward it, do a simple hands-to-toes check for proper positioning. 38 --- Page 58 Text --- Manipulating the Water Dolphin Kicking Away From the Wall Once you have gone through these helpful cues and can feel the pressure you are applying to the water, it is time for the real test of propulsive force, butterfly kicking away from the wall (figure 2.8).

Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective freestyle stroke. 51 --- Page 71 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success One key element of effective freestyle is maintaining a good horizontal position on the water. As mastered in step 1 (specifically, floating on your front), the basic position involves lying on the water with your head, hips, feet, and hands all at the surface of the water. As you remain stretched out on the water, ensure that your face is in the water and that you are looking straight down at the bottom of the pool. Basic FreesTyle sTrOke A good freestyle armstroke consists of four basic elements that provide the bulk of the propulsive force for swimming: catch, pull, finish, and recovery. The first is the catch. Beginning with the left hand, you will want to pitch the fingers down so that the hand is perpendicular to the direction you want to go (figure 3.1a). As the hand pitches down, you will rotate the elbow and shoulder so that the forearm is also per- pendicular to the direction you want to go. The second element is the pull. During this part of the stroke, you will pull the arm through so that the hand and forearm stay perpendicular to the direction you are going and the elbow remains bent (figure 3.1b). The finish of the stroke is next (figure 3.1c). As you progress through the middle and your arm is about midway down your body, you will transition from a pulling motion to that of a pushing motion almost as if you were going to try to slap your thigh with your hand. Lastly is the recovery (figure 3.1d). At this point you will raise the arm out

### Swimming STEPS TO SUCCESS_full_text.txt
modern backstroke led to several technique changes, as well as revised notions of how to swim the stroke most effectively. The original back- stroke was performed with the arms straight underwater and somewhat loose on the over- the-water recovery, almost as if it were the front crawl or freestyle turned upside down. Later, Australian swimmers used a bent-arm pull and developed a stroke closer to what is recognized as backstroke today. The great advantage of backstroke over other strokes is that the swimmer’s face is out of the water. In addition, swimmers who master the backstroke develop great balance on the water, which also benefits their freestyle stroke. In this step, you will develop the following skills: • Horizontal body line • Rotation on a long axis • Splashless entry and effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Kicking rhythm • Effective breathing • Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective backstroke. A good horizontal position is a key element of an effective backstroke and also lays the foundation for applying force to the water to achieve propulsion. As mastered in step 1 (floating on your back), the basic position involves lying on the water with your head, hips, feet, and hands at the surface. As you remain stretched out on the water, ensure that you are comfortable and balanced. Basic BacksTroke A good armstroke for the backstroke (figure 4.1) consists of four basic elements that provide the bulk of the propulsive force in swimming: catch, pull, finish (with your palm toward your body, not toward the bottom of the pool), and recovery. At some point when the strok- ing arm is near vertical, rotate your hand so that your pinkie finger leads the

the breaststroke. To work on your timing, you can use a few simple drills that empha- size it. The secret to the breaststroke hinges on the fact that half of its propulsive force comes from the kick and the other half from the pull. The key is not to do both at the same time. The proper rhythm is one kick, one pull and breath, and a return to the stretched-out position. 109 --- Page 129 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Drills for TiMinG anD rhyThM Because propulsion in the breaststroke derives equally from the kick and the pull, it is crucial to maximize the efficiency of each element. Get it wrong and you end up being very slow. The key is to make sure that you do not kick when pulling and vice versa. The following drills include some overcorrections of typical problems but should help you separate the two movements so that you can develop a good rhythm. Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 1 Two-hippopotamus Breaststroke This is a slow drill that helps you with your timing. It is performed by pushing off of the wall in the streamlined position. Do one breaststroke kick, then wait while count- ing “one hippopotamus . . . two hippopotamus.” Next, pull and breathe as described earlier and shoot forward before kicking again. This approach teaches the indepen- dent movements of the arms and legs. To increase DifficulTy • Count to “three hippopotamus.” To Decrease DifficulTy • Use a pull buoy far above your knees and kick.

Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 2 Two kicks per stroke This classic breaststroke drill increases your awareness of timing and body posi- tion; it also helps you with balance. It is performed by simply kicking twice in the stretched-out position with your hands far forward (but not on top of each other) and kicking twice per catch–pull sequence. Keep your head down with a long neck during each pair of kicks. To increase DifficulTy • Count to “three hippopotamus.” To Decrease DifficulTy • Use a pull buoy far above your knees and kick. 110 --- Page 130 Text --- Breaststroke Success Check Score Your Success • You can perform the drill while 1 point: You can go 10 yards. maintaining a long body line. 3 points: You can go 25 yards. • You do not move your hands 5 points: You can go 25 yards in 10 or and feet at the same time. more pulls. 7 points: You can go 25 yards in 9 or fewer pulls. Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 3 Breaststroke Pull With Dolphin Kick This is another classic drill used by most modern breaststrokers. To do it, simply per- form a breaststroke pull with one dolphin kick.

laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes: • Good body position • Effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Acceleration throughout the stroke • Kicking rhythm • Effective breathing • Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective butterfly. The basic motion of the butterfly involves an undulating rhythm in which the legs and arms are synchronized by precise timing. The most important element of a good butterfly stroke is the use of the body’s core, which is the greatest source of power. Here are the basic movements as you flow through the stroke. From the neutral position described in step 1—facedown in the water with your arms stretched out above your head—press your chest down toward the pool bottom. To help you do so, you can use a downward motion of your feet with your legs together in a dol- phin-kick downstroke. Next, push your hips down while arching your back to bring your head and chest back toward the surface. Again, you are encouraged to use your legs in a dol- phin-kick upstroke; you should feel some pressure on the backs of your legs and the bottoms of your feet. You use the dolphin kick here both to provide propulsive force and to manipulate the position of your center of buoyancy to produce an undulating motion. 115 --- Page 135 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success As you complete the undulating and kicking motion, pitch your fingers down toward the bottom of the pool and bend at the elbows in a motion similar to that of pushing yourself up out of

Dolphin Kicking Drill 2 Kick on Your Back This drill helps you continue to develop a symmetrical kick. Now that you feel the pressure on the water, it is time to ensure that it is propulsive pressure by moving through the water. The next part of the progression for an effective dolphin kick is to lie on your back in the neutral position described in step 1 with your hands at your sides for balance. Begin dolphin-kicking with special emphasis on the pressure on the bottoms of your feet. As with the backstroke flutter kick, keep your knees underwater; do not just “push” at the water with the tops of your feet. Some swimmers find it beneficial to think of curling the toes in order to feel the feet in a stretched-out position while keeping the ankles loose. Important note! You will not be able to see where you are going during this drill. Make sure that the backstroke flags are in place—5 yards from the wall—or have your coach or instructor stop you when necessary!

If this movement is done with great force, your hands and arms will recover almost by themselves. If you find yourself struggling to get your hands out of the water, check your positioning and practice the following drills. Butterfly Arm Recovery Drill 1 Dolphin Dive This classic drill helps you get used to the undulating motion and provides buoyant force support while you coordinate the over-the-water recovery. To perform it, stand in waist-deep water with your hands at your sides, then bend at the waist so that your chest is in the water but your shoulders are out. Your chin should touch the water as you look at a spot 8 to 10 inches (20-25 cm) in front of your face. Next, rotate your hands—so that your pinkies are up and your thumbs down— and sweep them forward over the water; near the beginning of the movement, put your face in the water. Now place your hands in the water in front of your shoulders or slightly wider. Push yourself forward off of the bottom and stretch out on the water while pushing your chest and your hips down toward the

near the beginning of the movement, put your face in the water. Now place your hands in the water in front of your shoulders or slightly wider. Push yourself forward off of the bottom and stretch out on the water while pushing your chest and your hips down toward the bottom. This is the same kicking motion described earlier. Pull yourself forward and, when your hands reach your hips, stop and stand up. Repeating this drill causes an undulating motion that serves as the basis for your stroke and allows you time to isolate the recovery por- tion of the stroke.

To do it, perform one pull for every four dolphin kicks. This technique isolates your hand positioning upon entry and immediately afterward. Lay your hands on the water directly in front of you so that your arms are above the head in an outstretched position like that of Superman when flying. Perform four dolphin kicks to continue moving forward while adjusting your hands and arms if necessary. If you find yourself having to lift your head and pitch your hands up to get back to the stretched-out position, you are driving the stroke too much with your upper body. Instead, think of laying your hands on the water and landing on your armpits. Remember to breathe only in the beginning part of the stroke. To increase DiFFiculTY • Speed up the rhythm.

that provides competitive swimmers with a target. Since both the breaststroke 147 --- Page 167 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success and the butterfly are forward-looking strokes, you can also easily sneak a peek at your distance from the wall. Many pools also have a spillover gutter system or a low coping that allows you to grasp the wall with your hands. This technique reduces your length and thus the resistance during your turn and causes your feet to come up close to the wall for the exchange. Figure 7.5 TwO-hanD TOuch Turn: apprOach Preparation 1. As you approach the wall, take a final stroke and reach for the wall with both hands. 2. Stretch for the wall rather than taking an additional short stroke. a Execution 1.
