After all, we use our bodies from head to toe to perform our sport. The complex system of muscles that weaves together over our frames allows us to do the quick, explosive movements, and the long, repetitious movements that make up swimming. Our muscles work in tandem to make it possible to perform tasks as simple as putting on goggles and as lofty as winning Olympic gold. Yet, when we see a fantastic swimmer moving through the water with grace and speed, we don’t associate their speed with muscular strength. Instead we associate it

work in tandem to make it possible to perform tasks as simple as putting on goggles and as lofty as winning Olympic gold. Yet, when we see a fantastic swimmer moving through the water with grace and speed, we don’t associate their speed with muscular strength. Instead we associate it with skill. We notice their skill at reducing drag and maintaining a streamlined body shape. We notice their skill at “feeling” the water and using it to their advantage. We notice their skill at coordinating stroke actions that together produce fluid forward motion. In fact, it is widely accepted that swimming is not a matter of muscling your way through the water. Swimmers have to know how to swim! Still, it is puzzling to see swimmers with such picture-perfect strokes that they could star in a video on stroke technique who, when the time comes to swim fast, are unable to generate speed. Then there are swimmers with equally developed stroke technique who move through the water with such velocity that they appear to be wearing invisible flippers. So, what is the difference? What makes one swimmer able to achieve speed in the water but another swimmer unable to? The main difference is strength. The mechanics of swimming are not based on technique alone but also on the application of force and power. When we swim, our muscles are engaged in an integrated sequence of actions to both exert resistance on the water and to balance and stabilize our bodies so that forward motion is realized. In this way, when two swimmers, both with solid stroke technique, are swimming side by side, the stronger swimmer will be faster. Thus, that fantastic swimmer, who looks like poetry in motion, is in actuality muscling his way through the water! By adding strength

so that forward motion is realized. In this way, when two swimmers, both with solid stroke technique, are swimming side by side, the stronger swimmer will be faster. Thus, that fantastic swimmer, who looks like poetry in motion, is in actuality muscling his way through the water! By adding strength to skill, faster swimming is possible. As the title of this book suggests, strength training for swimming is a very specialized activity. The specific audience and the specific goal of this book 7 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 7 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 10 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming lead us to the logical conclusion that swimming strength is not developed very well through a general approach to strength training. Building useable strength for swimming requires attention to more than making the muscles strong. It requires orientation toward specific aspects of strength. It requires simulation of swimming directionality and tempo. Above all, it requires attention to training multi-muscle movements, like those that make up swimming. General strength training may produce some positive results in a hit or miss fashion, but it can also produce bulk and fatigue that can interfere with swimming. To make sure that strength work produces the intended results for swimmers, it must be designed and structured with swimming in mind. To illustrate this point, I would like to share a story that a swimmer recounted with me about the last year of his long swimming career. He told me that he had been a dedicated swimmer, with twelve years of training and competition experience under his belt. He had enviable technique, and even more enviable endurance. Knocking off 10 x 200 on the 2:30, and swimming double workouts five days a week, was no problem. He was, in fact, a coaches’ ideal of self-motivation, and a

with twelve years of training and competition experience under his belt. He had enviable technique, and even more enviable endurance. Knocking off 10 x 200 on the 2:30, and swimming double workouts five days a week, was no problem. He was, in fact, a coaches’ ideal of self-motivation, and a role model of good work ethic to the rest of his team. He did it all because he dreamed of going to the Olympics. It was more than a dream though; it was a goal, and at the age of 18, he was determined to make the Olympic team. After months of intense training, he found himself at a plateau and decided to supplement his swimming with weights. In addition to swimming over 80,000 each week, he also went to the gym and lifted weights, understanding that more strength would benefit his swimming speed. He developed a routine of exercises from those he observed other people at the gym doing regularly, including all the standard body building lifts. He did bench press, military press and French curls by the dozens. He got to the point that he could lift impressive amounts of weight with little effort. He continued this routine diligently for several months, building a large and well-defined upper body. As the last meet of the season approached, he found himself feeling quite tired, and his test swims were not outstanding, showing a sluggish tempo and higher stroke count than desirable. Still, going into the competition, he maintained his confidence. He believed that because he had worked as hard as he could both in and out of the water, he would make a swimming breakthrough. But after his race, he was stunned to have made no progress at all. In fact, he had clocked a time that he achieved

confidence. He believed that because he had worked as hard as he could both in and out of the water, he would make a swimming breakthrough. But after his race, he was stunned to have made no progress at all. In fact, he had clocked a time that he achieved two years before. Disappointed that all of his dedication and training had made no impact, he became disheartened and soon lost interest in swimming, allowing his dream to slip away. 8 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 8 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 11 Text --- Introduction This sad story is all too common. A swimmer with amazing work ethic and goal-oriented drive gets into a cycle of extreme over-training and non- specific, non-progressive strength training. Despite red flags – including plateau, fatigue, and reduced flexibility – that foretell poor race results, the swimmer keeps training and fails to reach the goal. Coaches and swimmers: This is preventable! This book addresses strength training as a means to achieve more speed in the water, rather than simply a means to become stronger. Emphasis is placed on both the underlying concepts and crucial details of building strength that transfers to swimming. Readers will explore how to structure a strength training program that will work with the swimming routine. Readers will learn about the importance of individualizing training to match a swimmer’s stage of development, level of experience, and swimming specialty. Readers will discover what kinds of activities build usable strength in the water. At the end of the book, a series of strength training routines and circuits are included for each stage of development.

of the book, a series of strength training routines and circuits are included for each stage of development. Before skipping right to that chapter, please take time to read the rest of the book first so you will have the background information that will prepare you to get the best results possible. Here is to reaching your swimming dreams! 9 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 9 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 12 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming 10 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 10 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 13 Text --- What Makes Swimmers Fast? 1 WHAT MAKES SWIMMERS FAST? The common goal in competitive swimming is to swim faster and, to a large extent, training is the means to that objective. The evolution of our sport has been marked by countless theories of training, based on emerging science, past results and intuition. Determined swimmers pair with inspired coaches in search of the perfect formula for attaining swimming speed. Training methods using more volume, or less volume but more intensity both in and out of the water, diets with more protein or less protein, and various pre-competition rituals have been designed with the single purpose of defying speed barriers. And swimming times keep dropping, as many of these strategies have resulted in incredible success for individual swimmers. But the fact is no single training formula has worked across the board. Some swimmers do better swimming twice a day, while others only once. Some swimmers will benefit from weight training, while others will get more out of a self-resistance program. Some swimmers can eat anything, anytime, but some have to carefully watch their calorie intake. Some swimmers race better practicing all the way up to the day before the meet, but others need several days, or even weeks of rest. We have come to

more out of a self-resistance program. Some swimmers can eat anything, anytime, but some have to carefully watch their calorie intake. Some swimmers race better practicing all the way up to the day before the meet, but others need several days, or even weeks of rest. We have come to understand that a uniform training strategy for competitive swimming is both ineffective and unrealistic. Differences in stage of development, conditioning and skill level, body type, rate of recovery, and swimming specialty reveal that an individualized approach to training yields the best results. While there is no single alchemy, certain training principles have endured and gained acceptance as integral elements in the quest for swimming speed. 11 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 11 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 14 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming SWIMMING The main element in a swimmer’s training, at every stage of his or her career, must be swimming. Without frequent and ample time in the water, even the best athlete will not be prepared to swim fast because he will not be prepared to swim well. Only time in the water enables a swimmer to develop the swimming technique that leads to the essential ability to “feel” the water. Only time in the water teaches a swimmer to eliminate drag and be more “fishlike.” Only time in the water gives a swimmer the experience of coordinating stroke actions and accessing the best sequence of muscles to accomplish fluid forward motion. Only time in the water enables a swimmer to practice stroke economy, balance and stability in the aquatic environment. There is no substitute for time in the water. To be a faster swimmer, one first has to be a good swimmer. ATHLETIC BASE The saying goes, “better athletes make better swimmers.” There is no way around it.

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
training is the management of training time. Limitations on water time, as well as limits on the productive swimming a person can be expected to do in one session can lead to training content deficiencies. As we try to include every training element into our limited water time, we may end up short on every element. By supplementing water training with additional time dedicated to land-based strength work, more value can be achieved in with the overall training routine. Precious water time can be used to practice solid technique, including stroke coordination, the elimination of drag, refining “feel” for the water, and to experience swimming economically at any speed. Land work can be used to develop the full spectrum of swimming-specific strength, where it is developed most efficiently. NEW FEEDBACK Strength training also adds a new dimension of feedback to a swimmer’s routine. It is common for swimmers to become so accustomed to swimming that they forget to pay attention to the mechanics of what they are doing in the water. Land-based strength training provides a new way to “connect” with the physical actions of the sport. In addition, swimmers can observe improvement in strength as they adapt to the workload. More repetitions, more resistance, and faster tempo achieved over time on land give a swimmer concrete feedback that they are improving, thereby building confidence and motivation. 19 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 19 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 22 Text --- 20 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 20 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 23 Text --- Making Strength Training Count 2 MAKING STRENGTH TRAINING COUNT The ultimate effectiveness of a strength training program is measured in terms of what is accomplished in the pool.

--- Making Strength Training Count 2 MAKING STRENGTH TRAINING COUNT The ultimate effectiveness of a strength training program is measured in terms of what is accomplished in the pool. There must be positive results. To make sure this happens, the strength training program should be designed and redesigned to meet that objective. It should evolve as the swimmer’s strength evolves and consider the individual swimmer’s changing needs. This means that careful observation and monitoring must be an essential element of the program. By evaluating results, or lack of results, we can tailor the program to work better or take positive steps to redirect efforts. Ongoing evaluation should consider a number of issues, as outlined below. TRANSFERABILITY The key to a successful strength training program is that every activity must be transferable to swimming speed. If it doesn’t transfer, then it is a waste of time, or worse, it could even hinder faster swimming. Every strength training exercise can make a swimmer tired, but once the swimmer recovers, does the new strength improve his or her swimming speed? In order to get strength work to transfer to swimming speed, it is important to perform activities that use swimming-like movement and target major swimming-specific muscle groups that together produce that movement, including both visible and underlying muscles. We must strengthen the muscles that move us forward as well as those that stabilize us. It is important to consider directionality when applying resistance on land. Our primary effort should be focused in simulating the direction of swimming. It is also important to mimic swimming tempo as much as possible. A tempo slower than swimming tempo will not transfer to faster speed in the water. 21 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 21 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 24 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Finally, at

the direction of swimming. It is also important to mimic swimming tempo as much as possible. A tempo slower than swimming tempo will not transfer to faster speed in the water. 21 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 21 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 24 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Finally, at the stage of a swimmer’s career when he is specializing in particular events, it is important to focus on strength work that will benefit the swimmer’s specialty. Strength work for these specialists should maximize the strong aspects of the swimmer’s event and build up the weak points. For instance, if a swimmer is specializing in the 200 fly and has awesome stroke efficiency, but tends to lose tempo on the last 50, the emphasis of strength work should be on training for force (the strong point) as well as building power (the weak point). However, a 50 freestyle specialist who is an awesome finisher but needs to improve reaction time off the blocks, should focus on training for power (the strong point) as well as building explosiveness (the weak point). ADAPTATION Strength training is based on the premise that when muscles are stressed, they adapt to that stress, thus becoming stronger. Because the process of stressing muscles actually creates tiny tears in the muscle fibers, they must be allowed to rest and rebuild before they can become stronger. For this reason, strength building must be considered a long-term activity, designed to build strength gradually over time, using periods of stress and rest. When adaptation is allowed to occur in this way, it is important that the program evolve, providing new challenges to swimmers as they adapt. Such challenges can take the form of doing the same exercise with more load, more repetitions, or faster repetitions depending on the objective. Or

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
and rest. When adaptation is allowed to occur in this way, it is important that the program evolve, providing new challenges to swimmers as they adapt. Such challenges can take the form of doing the same exercise with more load, more repetitions, or faster repetitions depending on the objective. Or a swimmer could be asked to perform a more complex action than before. Simply repeating the same stress that the swimmer has already adapted to will not increase strength. Each time a swimmer adapts, new demands must be introduced. By using this kind of progression, a swimmer will develop strength more steadily through his or her career. 22 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 22 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 25 Text --- Making Strength Training Count There is no hard and fast timeline for adaptation. Just as with swimming, strength training does not produce immediate results. Patience is required. A conservative approach, using periodic test sets once a month to gauge adaptation, should determine when new challenges should be presented. ORIENTATION When exposed to resistance, muscle fibers adapt and develop, resulting in more strength. The kind of muscle fiber we develop depends on the amount, duration and rate of the resistance. Strength training can develop either slow or fast twitch muscle fiber. Slow twitch muscle fiber is associated with endurance and stamina. Strength training that focuses on developing power builds slow twitch muscle. Slow twitch muscle fiber enables us to do continuous or repetitive movements over a period of time. Fast twitch muscle fiber is associated with speed and agility. Strength training that focuses on developing force and explosiveness builds fast twitch muscle. Fast twitch muscle fiber enables us to sprint and produce bursts of acceleration. That being said, it is important to remember that in swimming, every event (no matter how short

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
fiber is associated with speed and agility. Strength training that focuses on developing force and explosiveness builds fast twitch muscle. Fast twitch muscle fiber enables us to sprint and produce bursts of acceleration. That being said, it is important to remember that in swimming, every event (no matter how short or how long) benefits from both slow and fast twitch muscle strength. While fast twitch muscle fiber is most important for sprinting, even the shortest swimming event requires a number of repetitions of a stroke to be performed over time. Therefore, some slow twitch fiber is also important for the sprinter to have a strong finish. Likewise, while slow twitch is most important for long distance swimming, some fast twitch muscle is essential for the distance swimmer to develop the force and explosive strength that would allow him or her to do quicker starts and all those turns. Swimming is an activity that builds slow twitch muscle very well. However, not a great deal of fast twitch muscle is built by swimming. This leads some to conclude that the orientation of a strength training program for swimmers should focus on slow twitch development because it is the kind of strength 23 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 23 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 26 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming that swimmers use most. But that is only half of the picture. The reason swimmers engage in land-based strength training is to build more strength than they can achieve in the water. If the goal of strength training is more speed then our efforts should address building fast twitch muscle fiber, the type of muscle fiber associated with speed. The most effective strength training program, oriented toward the goal of more speed, must actively address fast twitch muscle development in addition to supplementing

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
presence of convertible muscle fiber offers swimmers the opportunity to train for more versatility. However, at some point in a swimmer’s career, success in certain events leads that swimmer to narrow his or her focus a bit. At that point, training too should be focused toward particular specialties. Training equally for all distances could reduce the results at either extreme. Some sprinters can develop a great deal of bulk, resulting in more resistance and density in the water, in addition to less flexibility that would hinder long distance performance. Conversely, the stroke tempo of most distance swimmers is too slow to achieve great sprinting success. By training for all distances, a swimmer could expect to become pretty fast across the board, but not very fast at any one event. By specializing, a swimmer maximizes performance by training convertible muscle fiber to enhance natural skills. 24 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 24 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 27 Text --- Making Strength Training Count VARIATION The concept of alternating stress and rest suggests that a swimmer should not do strength training on a daily basis. Actually, for some swimmers, a well-designed strength training program can be done on sequential days, although it is advisable to incorporate one to two days off per week for “pure” rest. The design of a successful daily program accomplishes the stress and rest model by having the swimmer perform upper body exercises on one day and lower body exercises the next day. On the upper body work day, the lower body rests, and on the lower body work day, the upper body rests. Building in variation in training also keeps a swimmer sharp, both mentally and physically. A creatively designed program uses a diverse array of exercises to meet each training objective. For instance, if the objective is explosiveness,

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
and motivate each other as they master the coordination of a new exercise. OVER-TRAINING In general, swimmers have a great work ethic. The combination of mental toughness and a highly developed fitness level enables them to keep working when they are tired. While, in many ways, this is an admirable trait, it also leaves swimmers vulnerable to over-training. The danger of over- training becomes a real concern especially when strength training is added to a swimmer’s routine. It is important to remember that the main objective of strength training is to enable a swimmer to produce more speed in the pool. If strength training is leaving a swimmer continually too tired to swim well, he or she is probably over-training. 26 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 26 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 29 Text --- Making Strength Training Count Signs of over-training include continual early fatigue in swim practice, slow tempo, poor race results, plateau, slow adaptation, insomnia, impatience, prolonged grumpiness and lack of interest. Over-training should be distinguished from the temporary fatigue associated with an intense cycle of training that is followed by a planned cycle of rest, although it may be hard to tell the difference. However, a swimmer who is temporarily fatigued will respond positively to rest and perform better after resting. A swimmer who is over-trained will not show much speed improvement after rest because he has not successfully adapted along the way. The best way to deal with over-training is to make sure it doesn’t happen. Careful and ongoing monitoring of progress is required. This is the responsibility of the coach because often the swimmer will just keep working, focused on the motto he or she has heard throughout his or her swimming career, “If you want to be fast, you have to work hard.” If a swimmer

ongoing monitoring of progress is required. This is the responsibility of the coach because often the swimmer will just keep working, focused on the motto he or she has heard throughout his or her swimming career, “If you want to be fast, you have to work hard.” If a swimmer is showing signs of over-training, it should not be ignored. Reduce training, either in terms of duration, intensity or frequency, both in and out of the pool. It might be necessary for the swimmer to take a few days off to recover, then start fresh with a new training plan. If caught early, a few days off will allow a swimmer to get back on the right track. Long-term over-training can result in a season of frustration and an associated drop in confidence and a loss of motivation to continue in the sport. Coaches must learn to emphasize the fact that rest is good just as strongly as they emphasize the benefits of hard work. The former is a difficult concept for many swimmers to accept, but it is an important one. Sometimes, just working hard does not result in speed; it results in an overly tired swimmer. There is a very fine line between working very hard and working too hard, and every swimmer’s threshold is slightly different. Finding each swimmer’s balance point is a crucial part of designing a training program that results in faster swimming. 27 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 27 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 30 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming SEASON PLANNING The goal of strength training is to progressively produce more swimming speed over a swimmer’s career, by season, and from meet to meet.

Strength Training for Faster Swimming SEASON PLANNING The goal of strength training is to progressively produce more swimming speed over a swimmer’s career, by season, and from meet to meet. Because the ultimate test of the effectiveness of a strength training program is race performance, we must plan our program with competition dates in mind. To ensure that a swimmer is ready to race well, the training plan must accommodate some degree of rest before race day. However, with swim meets scheduled an average of once per week during high school and college seasons, and once every two weeks for age group swimmers, planning for competitions poses training continuity problems. In addition, when frequently accommodating rest before swim meets, the cumulative effect of training is hard to achieve. For this reason, it is a good idea to look at the season as a whole and work toward a positive conclusion, allowing for benchmark or qualifying opportunities along the way. By defining three levels of competitions, some meets will be identified as priority events and incorporate planned breaks in training, while some will be treated as part of the training. 28 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 28 12.07.11 12:11 --- OCR from Page 30 Image 1 --- COLORADO --- Page 31 Text --- Making Strength Training Count PRACTICE MEETS In preparation for practice meets, little or no change in the training routine should be made. Just as we “swim through” some competitions, we can also strength train through them. No best times should be expected. Rather than best times, the objective should be stroke quality. TARGET MEETS In advance of target meets, the swimmer should be allowed some time to rest. While some swimmers require more rest than others, even one or two days break from the strength training routine can give a

While some swimmers require more rest than others, even one or two days break from the strength training routine can give a swimmer’s muscles an opportunity to recover enough to perform well without seriously interrupting the long-term strength training plan. Signs of improvement toward the strength training objective should be visible. Some best times can be expected. CHAMPIONSHIP MEETS Strength training should stop about two weeks before the championship meet to allow the swimmer time to adapt and rebuild fully. Although some swimmers get nervous that they will lose their strength, they should be assured that the work they have done on land will be maintained by using it in the pool during this strength training break. Best times should be achieved. After the competition season, the off-season period can provide a good block of time to build a solid base of well-rounded strength for the next competition season. It also provides the opportunity to make modifications in a swimmer’s strength training routine as determined through observation and evaluation of the swimmer’s overall performance during the season past. 29 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 29 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 32 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming 30 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 30 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 33 Text --- The Swimming Muscles 3 THE SWIMMING MUSCLES Swimming is considered by many to be the best form of full body exercise.

best form of full body exercise. The well-documented cardiovascular benefits of swimming focus largely on its healthy effect on the heart and lungs. Upon closer examination, we see that the function of the heart and lungs is to carry oxygen-rich blood to the working muscles and to transport oxygen-depleted blood away from them. What makes swimming particularly good for the heart and lungs is that so many muscles are being used at the same time. In fact, swimming uses almost every muscle in the body in a coordinated and repetitive, cycling manner that exposes them to sustained exertion in a medium that is thicker than air. Well-conditioned swimmers, in general, have extremely low resting heart rates, a measure of good fitness, and are known to have one of the most developed capillary systems of all athletes. As a swimmer is able to swim farther and faster, the oxygen demand of the muscles increases. As the heart and lungs adapt to meet the demand, new capillaries form, branching out from the existing blood supply network to better provide the muscles in use with more oxygen. Not only does swimming use more muscles at once than most other sports, it also uses muscles in ways that we don’t often use them for other activities. As erect beings, humans spend most of their time using our muscles from the vertical position. However, because swimming is done from a horizontal position, muscle exertion is initiated and carried out in different planes than we are used to. To illustrate this point, compare the actions 31 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 31 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 34 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming performed with the arms in rowing with those used in swimming. They have many similarities and use many of the same muscles. Rowing, in

used to. To illustrate this point, compare the actions 31 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 31 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 34 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming performed with the arms in rowing with those used in swimming. They have many similarities and use many of the same muscles. Rowing, in fact, is a land exercise often recommended for swimmers. Both rowers and swimmers initiate the arm movement with their arms extended in front of them. Both pull toward the body. Both use a cycling arm action. However, in rowing, the athlete’s body position is perpendicular to the arms. In swimming, the body is positioned parallel to the arms. This fundamental difference distinguishes the way the muscles exert themselves in swimming from the way they do in rowing and most other land activities. The foot position of swimmers is another good example of the unique way muscles are used in swimming. Without the ground as a foundation, the feet take on a completely different role in the water. The primary human foot position is perpendicular to the leg, creating a base to stand on and spring from. In swimming, this foot position is used only in a limited fashion for the breaststroke kick, and for starts and turns. Instead, the primary foot position for swimmers is pointed, heel to toe. From this position, it is the top of the foot that applies the most resistance rather than the sole of the feet. This seemingly minor difference is central to how the muscles in the entire leg are used. In fact, it is common for people who are not used to swimming to experience cramps in the calf and in the arch of the foot when they swim due to the different requirements of the muscles when resistance is applied with the

muscles in the entire leg are used. In fact, it is common for people who are not used to swimming to experience cramps in the calf and in the arch of the foot when they swim due to the different requirements of the muscles when resistance is applied with the top of the foot. With all this in mind, a strength training program that will be effective for swimmers must consider the full body requirements of swimming, the unique ways swimmers use their muscles, and role each muscle group performs in the act of swimming. 32 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 32 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 35 Text --- The Swimming Muscles LINKING MUSCLE MOVEMENT Looking at the anatomy of the human body and the distribution of muscles, we can see that the largest muscles are situated closer to the center of the body. We can also see that the fibers that make up each muscle have a distinct grain. By examining the direction Muscle distribution and grain of this grain, as well as how the muscles overlap each other, and the point each muscle anchors to the bone, we get an indication of what sort of action each muscle group is capable of and responsible for. With this knowledge, we can better connect muscles to movement and employ them to better move us through the water. The sequence of muscles called to action in coordinated swimming works in a chain reaction to move the swimmer forward. This flow of energy travels through the body, passing from one muscle group to another throughout each stroke cycle, producing efficient forward motion. Often referred to as the kinetic chain, this connected movement is what a swimmer should strive to simulate in strength training. Rather than isolating one muscle, consider that that muscle is just

through the body, passing from one muscle group to another throughout each stroke cycle, producing efficient forward motion. Often referred to as the kinetic chain, this connected movement is what a swimmer should strive to simulate in strength training. Rather than isolating one muscle, consider that that muscle is just part of a larger movement. Imagine a baseball player standing at bat. His arms support the bat, but when he swings to hit the ball, not only will the muscles of his arms come into play but he will employ the muscles in his shoulders, chest, abdomen, 33 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 33 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 36 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming upper and lower back, and legs in one connected motion to send the ball flying fast and far. If instead he used the muscles in his arms in isolation, even with all his strength, the velocity and trajectory of the ball would land it at the pitcher’s feet. It is the same with swimming. An effective swimmer throws his or her body into each stroke, employing not only the muscles of the arms but those in the shoulders, chest, abdomen, upper and lower back, and legs to produce a connected motion with each stroke that moves the body farther and faster, and with less fatigue, than if the arms were used in isolation. An ineffective swimmer moves his or her arms and legs independently of each other, expending a great deal of effort to basically perform four separate actions, rather than one connected action. Linking the muscles together in coordinated movement allows the swimmer to produce better forward motion with less effort. For this reason, strength training for swimmers should involve multiple muscle groups, to simulate swimming motion as much as possible, rather than training muscles

four separate actions, rather than one connected action. Linking the muscles together in coordinated movement allows the swimmer to produce better forward motion with less effort. For this reason, strength training for swimmers should involve multiple muscle groups, to simulate swimming motion as much as possible, rather than training muscles in isolation. MOVING AND STABILIzING 34 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 34 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 37 Text --- The Swimming Muscles Muscles throughout the body are involved in creating forward movement for the swimmer. Each of these muscles is dedicated to produce specific motions that contribute to the swimming motion as a whole. While muscles create movement for the swimmer, they also have another important function. Muscles also perform as stabilizers. Like in other sports, muscles provide stability to the body in motion and the joints. The muscles that stabilize the knee, for example, keep the bones of the upper and lower leg aligned. Imagine what would happen if there were no stabilizers at the knee; walking, standing, and kicking would be impossible. Unique to swimming is the additional role of the muscles in providing stability to the moving body as it floats. Without the ground to stand on, swimmers must create their own foundation of stability. In order to move forward in swimming, muscles in one area of the body must be engaged in balancing the effect of an action in another part of the body. These stabilizing muscles maintain tension against the resistance that is being applied. Without good tension, the effect that is produced is not forward motion as desired but a fishtailing or bobbing movement. Muscles are often categorized as movers and stabilizers. While some muscles serve exclusively as stabilizers, many muscles actually perform both functions. It is the larger surface layer muscles of the core and

tension, the effect that is produced is not forward motion as desired but a fishtailing or bobbing movement. Muscles are often categorized as movers and stabilizers. While some muscles serve exclusively as stabilizers, many muscles actually perform both functions. It is the larger surface layer muscles of the core and limbs that can act both as both movers and stabilizers as the body goes through the series of stroke actions that make up swimming. There are several examples of this dual function in swimming. THE TRAPEzIUS The trapezius muscle is the large muscle of the upper back that connects the neck and the shoulders and the back. The trapezius moves and rotates the shoulders and neck, as well as stabilizes the shoulder blades and upper body. In freestyle, the trapezius is engaged as a primary mover during breathing as the head turns for the inhale, and during recovery, as the arm moves back to the beginning of the stroke. It also serves as a stabilizer assisting the swimmer in maintaining 35 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 35 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 38 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming a positive floating position throughout the entire stroke action. When a swimmer presses his or her chest down to achieve the “downhill” floating position, the shoulder blades move closer together. The trapezius is employed in achieving and holding this position. THE OBLIQUES The obliques are bilateral abdominal muscles located at either side of the “six pack.” The function of the obliques is to assist in rotation and sideways stabilization of the body. In freestyle and backstroke, the obliques act in partnership, one as a mover and one as a stabilizer, to produce the pendulum- like roll that provides leverage to the arm stroke. As the swimmer rolls into the stroke, the oblique muscle

at high speed, we see that it holds its front limbs flat against the sides of its body and uses a narrow, undulating motion that starts at the head and moves down through its body. This wave action is based on movement and stabilization of the seal’s spine by the muscles that surround it. It is a swimming technique that de-emphasizes the limbs for producing speed in the water. In fact, the seal uses its front limbs for steering rather than propulsion. In addition, the evolution of the seal’s rear limbs has led them to be fused into one great limb down to the ankles, creating in essence an extension of the seal’s body. By using the muscles of its powerful trunk to produce and control movement, the seal has achieved a “limbless” swimming style that, in comparative studies, has recorded it swimming a distance of one mile more than six times faster than the fastest human swimmer, with five times less effort! In the absence of evolutionary adaptations such as webbed toes and a streamlined body shape that would make the human form more seal-like, we can learn a lot about swimming from this creature and work toward achieving a more seal-like technique that utilizes the muscles of our core to generate more efficiency and swimming speed. 39 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 39 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 42 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming The muscles of the core are crucial to the overall effectiveness of swimming. Core strength should be a main priority of any strength training program for swimmers. Strengthening the core involves targeting a series of muscles that work together to create a better foundation to swim from. These muscles are listed below. FRONT CORE MUSCLES The front core muscles include the abdominals, most visibly the

are located in the shoulders. In swimming, we reach, extend and align with our shoulders, use them to apply resistance to the water on multiple planes, and we use them to throw our arms forward to do it all over again. While the extraordinary shoulder enables all of these motions, swimming puts a lot of demand on them. Therefore, taking care of our shoulders should be a priority. Just like a race car designed to perform, to ensure that it is ready to work at an optimal level, regular maintenance of its systems is key. Likewise, our shoulders are so crucial to swimming that maintaining them is just as important. We must both understand their parts and attend to their mechanisms. Shoulder maintenance should be considered a regular part of a strength training program. We must strengthen them from the inside out. The shoulder has two joints. The first, commonly known as the shoulder joint, lies under the visible deltoid muscle. This joint allows the extensive rotation of the arm that is so basic to swimming. It is a ball and socket type joint, located where the top of the arm bone meets the shoulder blade. Resembling a golf tee, the end of the arm bone sits on top of a shallow socket in the shoulder blade. The remarkable range of motion allowed by this joint ironically makes it vulnerable to instability. The “ball” is held in place on the “tee” directly by four small muscles that surround the joint, stabilizing it during motion. These muscles together are called the rotator cuff. 42 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 42 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 45 Text --- The Swimming Muscles ROTATOR CUFF The four muscles of the rotator cuff each have different functions: Supraspinatus — stabilizes movement of the arm up and away

stabilizing it during motion. These muscles together are called the rotator cuff. 42 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 42 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 45 Text --- The Swimming Muscles ROTATOR CUFF The four muscles of the rotator cuff each have different functions: Supraspinatus — stabilizes movement of the arm up and away from the body Subscapularis — stabilizes internal arm rotation Infraspinatus — stabilizes external arm rotation Teres minor — stabilizes internal arm rotation and lifting of the arm When one or more of the rotator cuff muscles is weak, damaged, or develops unevenly, the bones are not held stable and can move around in the joint, leading to inflammation of the surrounding tissues and shoulder pain. In swimmers, poor stroke technique, overuse, or other muscular imbalances can all contribute to rotator cuff problems. But even when these factors are identified and corrected, it is necessary to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles before the shoulder joint can regain stability and perform correctly. SCAPULAE REGION The second joint of the shoulder is located at the intersection of the clavicle, commonly known as the collarbone, and the top of the scapulae, commonly known as the shoulder blade. This joint performs like a hinge for the shoulder blade. The shoulder blade enables the overhead motions we use in every swimming stroke. Like the shoulder joint, the job of the shoulder blade is to allow extensive motion. To facilitate this, it is held in place only by the muscles, in contrast to most other joints in the body, which also have tendons and ligaments to support them. When a swimmer has poor posture, weak back muscles or overly developed chest muscles, the shoulder blades can move out of place. The unstable shoulder blade slides upward, tipping out from the back at the lower edge of the

common swimming-related health problems. If a swimmer’s shoulder does become painful, rest, as well as targeted strengthening exercises of the shoulder stabilizers, should be part of the recovery process. 44 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 44 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 47 Text --- The Swimming Muscles KEY MUSCLES FOR CERTAIN STROKES We want to think in terms of multi-muscle swimming movements as much as possible, however because the pull pattern, kicking action, leverage and balance requirements in each of the four competitive swimming strokes is unique, we must consider which muscles are especially important to each stroke. BUTTERFLY The wide bilateral recovery of the butterfly places a demand on the trapezius unlike any other stroke. In addition, the initial movements of the power phase are done when the swimmer’s body is lower than the chest, requiring the pectoralis major to engage in a distinct lifting action. Finally, as the dolphin kick places the hips in a higher position relative to the body than in other strokes, the gluteus maximus comes into play. Key Butterfly Muscles 45 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 45 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 48 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming BACKSTROKE To achieve the ideal body position in backstroke, the pelvis must be tilted Key Backstroke Muscles forward through abdominal contraction of the retus abdominus. The upward kick, against gravity also puts a large demand on the quads. The unique catch position, behind the head requires the rhomboids to contract heavily. Finally, the elongated push portion of the arm stroke engages the triceps more completely, and for a longer duration than in other strokes.

engages the triceps more completely, and for a longer duration than in other strokes. BREASTSTROKE The unique requirements of the breaststroke kick engage several muscles that are not otherwise used much in swimming. While the hamstrings are used to raise the heels, the hip flexors and abductors perform and stabilize the sweeping motion of the kick. As the foot position goes from completely feet flexed to completely pointed, the calf muscles are also heavily engaged. The abbreviated breaststroke arm stroke employs the biceps more so than the other strokes during the in-sweep of the Key Breaststroke Muscles 46 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 46 12.07.11 12:12 --- OCR from Page 48 Image 2 --- Key Backstroke Muscles --- OCR from Page 48 Image 4 --- Key Breaststroke Muscles --- Page 49 Text --- The Swimming Muscles stroke. Finally, the breaststroke’s underwater recovery employs the upper trapezius to shrug and roll the shoulders forward as the arms return to the extended position. FREESTYLE The three-dimensional sweeping pull pattern of the freestyle taxes the shoulders more than any other stroke. Rotator cuff muscles and muscles of the scapular region work overtime to stabilize the shoulders in freestyle, as the arms rotate from a high elbow position to the rear of the body during recovery to an extended position in front of the body during the power phase. Finally, the obliques serve as primary movers in freestyle to produce the corkscrew effect that sends power from the core to the upper and lower limbs.

It involves the growth and maturing of every body system. It happens in its own time. Although we may contribute to physical development through good nutrition and healthy living, and we may even exert some control on heightening performance through training, we cannot hurry the actual process of development. While some have tried to influence this process with growth hormones and other drugs, the rewards are very short-lived, and the consequences are great and enduring as the body rebels by becoming sick, injured or shutting down, unable to support artificially accelerated development. Gradual, natural development allows the systems of the body to physically support each other as they grow. The skeleton of a child cannot support the muscles of an adult, but as the child’s bones grow, larger muscles and more strength are possible. Gradual development also allows time for important connections to be established between the brain and the body. As we develop, our simple actions evolve into more complex actions over time. Initial, awkward movements become coordinated and seamless. While people develop at different rates, there is a predictable progression of development that occurs in stages over a lifetime. When designing a strength training program, the stage of development is an important consideration. Strength training encompasses a wide variety of activities, which meet a wide variety of objectives. For every stage, there are particular developmental milestones that should correspond to strength training objectives. As the stage of development changes, strength training objectives must change, too. The content of a

result of a growth-related posture imbalance in which the spine curves toward the belly. It is a condition that is usually soon outgrown. Children at this stage have an immense amount of energy but limited coordination and very little endurance. The objective of strength training at this stage of development is to build a solid athletic base. Appropriate strength training sessions three to five days a week, for about 15 minutes, should include activities that promote the five areas of general athleticism – using the child’s own resistance only – in short periods of work followed by periods of rest. This work should be fun in order to hold the characteristic short attention span of young children as long as possible. PRE-ADOLESCENCE Children at this stage of development experience rapid growth in both height and weight. Often the child has spurts where he or she grows lengthwise and then widthwise, leading to periods of awkwardness. Ultimately, the trunk and limbs lengthen and more strength is possible. Stamina also increases and coordination steadily develops. Balance eventually improves. The objective of strength training at this stage of development is to improve stability, coordination, and to build 52 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 52 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 55 Text --- Stages of Development THE EARLY DEVELOPER AND THE LATE BLOOMER At age 11, Peter was a dedicated member of the swim team who diligently swam five days a week, focusing on good technique and making every interval.

Peter kept whittling away slowly and patiently at his times in competition and, after advancing to the 13-14 division, he adopted the 100 fly as his new favorite. At the first meet of spring, Peter stepped up on the blocks, seeded tenth in the fly. He swam the first 50 with ease and precision but felt uneasy when he found himself with more energy than usual going in the last lap. Intent on giving the race his best, he put his head down and accelerated his stroke tempo. When the final wall came, Peter looked up and was shocked to see he had won the race, erasing nine full seconds from his previous best time. As he emerged from the pool, he heard a familiar voice. “I told you!” the coach said. Peter grinned widely. It was only then that he observed that he was not looking up at his coach, but looking at him eye to eye. He realized at that moment that his patience had paid off, and it was finally his turn to shine. 53 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 53 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 56 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming power. Appropriate strength training activities for this stage of development include exercises that address core stability balance and tempo, using the child’s own resistance only.

ADOLESCENCE During adolescence, athletes go through a time of continuous change that includes physical maturing and weight gain. As they go through puberty, athletes experience periods of rapid strength gain alternating with periods where strength lags behind their growth. At times, their physical changes are accompanied by awkwardness and self- consciousness. At other times, they are accompanied by bravado and testing of their new characteristics. The objective at this stage of development is building power, force, stability, and coordination. When well supervised, swimmers can make important progress during this time, with gains in applicable strength. Sessions of 30 minutes or more, five days a week should include self-resistance work, medicine balls and some stretch bands, accompanied by clearly stated objectives. This combination of training can encourage swimmers to focus on achieving great improvements in swimming speed. YOUNG ADULT At this stage, the athlete has adult physical characteristics and size. This is a period when the athlete is at the peak of strength and performance potential. With a solid foundation of athleticism, swimming and strength work, the now fully mature swimmer can make huge and continuing gains in speed with dedication to a solid training routine and a healthy lifestyle. 54 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 54 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 57 Text --- Stages of Development The objective at this stage is maximizing force, power, and explosiveness.

One of the good examples she had provided for her children was to maintain a regular physical fitness routine throughout their childhood. An active competitive swimmer in her youth, Joy had chosen swimming as her fitness activity, going to the pool twice a week before daylight for an hour or so to swim laps. Although she was no longer a speed demon in the pool, she had maintained a healthy weight, good muscle tone and flexibility that other mothers often admired. Now that she didn’t have to hurry back home to meet the responsibilities of the household, she decided to re-dedicate herself to her sport. She increased her swimming time, adding another day a week, and then another half hour per session. She added variety to her swimming routine by doing sets and different strokes. It was not long before Joy started feeling the effects of her efforts and soon was able to do 100s on the 1:30 like she had when she was a teenager. Swimming became the passion in Joy’s life. She loved the challenge and confidence that swimming gave her. She kept track of her workouts, recording her yardage and tracking her progress toward benchmarks she set for herself. She read books on swimming science and technique, and incorporated what she learned into her swimming routine, even adding some stretch cord work to her program three times a week. At age 65, Joy was thrilled to become the grandmother of twins. To celebrate this milestone, she decided to enter a competition for adult swimmers. With anticipation, but no expectations, she arrived at the event and was pleased that she, by no means, was the oldest swimmer present. Elated by the camaraderie and positive atmosphere she encountered, she swam to a second place finish in the 200 backstroke.

When secured in the middle to a stationary pole, the stretch cord enables the swimmer to simulate the entire range of motion that makes up the power phase of the stroke against resistance. Stretch cords also require the use of an accelerating motion to accomplish the action successfully, exactly like swimming. The motion is repeated with a controlled reverse action or recovery between each exertion. The swimmer can use a tempo equal to his or her swimming tempo against resistance or practice an “ideal” higher tempo. Stretch cords also promote core stabilization, as the swimmer must maintain constant tension in

swimming. The motion is repeated with a controlled reverse action or recovery between each exertion. The swimmer can use a tempo equal to his or her swimming tempo against resistance or practice an “ideal” higher tempo. Stretch cords also promote core stabilization, as the swimmer must maintain constant tension in the body from the standing position, bent forward at the waist, while the arms are moving. Stretch cords are available in a variety of thicknesses, which determine their resistance. Because too much resistance will make proper technique impossible, it is important to start with a stretch band that has less resistance and work up to more resistance when good technique is maintained. The following stretch cord exercises are highly recommended: 82 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 82 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 85 Text --- Let’s Get Specific FULL BODY Double Arm Pull — Standing and bent forward at the waist, hold the stretch cord in both hands and perform the underwater path of butterfly, accelerating throughout.

Alternating Arm Pull — Standing and bent forward at the waist, hold the stretch cord with both hands and perform the underwater path of freestyle, accelerating toward the end with one arm while the other recovers gently following the reverse path. Repeat in an alternating manner. Double Triceps Press — Standing straight, hold the stretch cord with both hands, with the elbows at a right angle and firmly against the sides of the body. Straighten the arms quickly without moving elbows. Recover gently along the same path. Repeat. Alternating Triceps Press — Standing straight, hold the stretch cord with both hands, with elbows at a right angle and firmly against the sides of the body.

With one end of the stretch band anchored at the elbow level to the left of the body, hold the other end of the band in the left hand outside the body, with the elbow bent to 90 degrees and held firm to the side of the body. Swing the lower arm inward as if it were a door closing. Recover along the same path. Close and open repeatedly. Anchor stretch band to the right of the body and repeat motion with the right arm. Back Scrubber — With the length of the stretch band folded in half, hold one end of the stretch band in the left hand and raise the hand over your head, palm back, then drop the elbow down so the stretch band dangles down the back. With the right hand, reach down behind the back and grasp the other end of the stretch band. Gently pull the band up with the left hand, then down with the right hand repeatedly, as if scrubbing the back. Repeat with hands in opposite positions. 85 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 85 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 88 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming EXERCISE MACHINES Exercise machines provide a great aerobic component to a land-based routine, raising the heart rate and contributing to endurance.

recommended only for athletes who have reached the young adult stage of development. Real consequences can occur when weights are used too early in a swimmer’s development. It is not a myth! Growth plates in young developing swimmers can be damaged under the load of weights. When a swimmer is physically ready for weights, they provide an efficient way to build muscle strength. Weight rooms are full of equipment and machines, some which address swimming and some that don’t. It is important to remember that we are trying to simulate swimming movement, directionality and tempo as much as possible. WEIGHT MACHINES Weight machines that use pulley systems generally address swimming movement in terms of directionality, range of motion, and by requiring accelerating movements. There are also machines that work on lever systems. Some of these are beneficial to swimmers. Some, however, apply resistance in the reverse direction of swimming, and others are designed to isolate muscles rather than to engage multi-muscle movements. Weight machines that are especially beneficial to swimmers include: 88 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 88 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 91 Text --- Let’s Get Specific UPPER BODY/ARMS Lat Pull — This machine has a wide bar suspended overhead from a cable and a pulley that attaches to an adjustable stack of weights at the other end below.

These include hand-held dumbbells, barbells and bars. Work with free weights can be useful as it requires the swimmer to stabilize the weight while exerting. However, many free weight exercises do not address swimming motion as the resistance applied is in the reverse direction of swimming. Free weight activities for swimmers should be carefully evaluated in terms of objective and be included as a primary activity only if they simulate swimming motion. Free weight activities that are especially beneficial to swimmers include: FULL BODY March — Stand holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.

Fundamental principles represent the foundation from which you can structure a program that will have predictable and positive results. HOW MUCH AND HOW MANY? These are very important questions when it comes to strength training. We must clearly understand the significance of how much resistance, how many repetitions, at what rate, and how much frequency and duration is necessary in relation to our strength training objectives. Without this knowledge, we could end up with a different outcome than intended. More quantity does not always translate to more strength. Knowing “how much” and “how many” is as important as knowing which exercises to do. HOW MUCH RESISTANCE? With self-resistance work, the load that is resisted is exclusively the swimmer’s body weight, but when external load is added, as with stretch cords, medicine balls and weights, the question of how much resistance needs to be answered. In general, to build power,

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
which exercises to do. HOW MUCH RESISTANCE? With self-resistance work, the load that is resisted is exclusively the swimmer’s body weight, but when external load is added, as with stretch cords, medicine balls and weights, the question of how much resistance needs to be answered. In general, to build power, the athlete should be able to repeat the exercise with a load 12 to 15 times without failure. If he or she cannot do this, the load is too much. If it is extremely easy, the load is too little. In contrast, to build force, a larger load should be used. The athlete should be able to repeat an exercise only about three to five times. Again, if he or she cannot do this, the load is too much. If it is extremely easy, the load is too little. HOW MANY REPETITIONS? We also need to know how many times to repeat a particular action or sequence. We count repetitions, or reps, and we count sets. A rep is a single action of the exercise. Use the guidelines described above for reps. A set is a group of reps. Multiple sets have rest between them. As far as how many 97 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 97 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 100 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming sets to do, when the objective is force or explosiveness, fewer sets are done, and sometimes, only a single set is performed. When the objective is power or endurance, more sets are done. Most people do three to five sets when training for power. HOW MUCH RATE? How fast or slowly an exercise is repeated also is determined by the strength training objective. An exercise done at a faster rate tends to build force and explosiveness. An exercise done at slower rate tends

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
Most people do three to five sets when training for power. HOW MUCH RATE? How fast or slowly an exercise is repeated also is determined by the strength training objective. An exercise done at a faster rate tends to build force and explosiveness. An exercise done at slower rate tends to build power. With some exercises, it is possible to simulate swimming tempo very well by allowing the athlete to perform repetitions at a rate of about one per second. Stretch cord work is a good example of this. Some exercises are not designed for stroke tempo work, so do not attempt to achieve such a tempo. The Lat Pull is a good example of an exercise that should not be used for tempo work as it is very important not to rush the recovery, but to control it instead. HOW RESISTANCE, REPETITIONS AND RATE WORK TOGETHER To get the intended outcome, we look at the amount of resistance, or load, the number of repetitions and sets, and the rate that the exercise is performed together. For instance, if our objective is to develop force, we must pair fewer repetitions and sets with more load. If we try to build force by increasing both the number of repetitions and the load at the same time, the swimmer will soon experience failure, and the objective will not be met. In contrast, if our objective is to develop power, we must pair more repetitions and sets with less resistance. If we try to build power by increasing both the number of repetitions and the load at the same time, the swimmer will soon experience failure, and the objective will not be met. HOW MUCH FREQUENCY AND DURATION? Frequency refers to the number of strength training sessions in a week, month or season.

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
to build power by increasing both the number of repetitions and the load at the same time, the swimmer will soon experience failure, and the objective will not be met. HOW MUCH FREQUENCY AND DURATION? Frequency refers to the number of strength training sessions in a week, month or season. Duration refers to how long each session is. Frequency should be determined by the swimmer’s stage of development in conjunction with the strength training content. For instance, a program using weights, for developmentally advanced swimmers should accommodate rest and recovery time between sessions. A program for beginners, however, that is based on a good variety of self-resistance activities can be done several days in a row in order to develop a good athletic base. Swimmers in the adult or senior stages of development should build in more rest days, as recovery takes longer. 98 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 98 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 101 Text --- The Fundamentals BEFORE OR AFTER SWIMMING? When is the best time to do strength training, before or after swimming? The debate is ongoing. On the one hand, it is clear that strength training before swimming activates the muscles that will be used in the pool. Swimming-specific strength training before swimming also reinforces good form in the water. Studies have shown that the nervous system connections established and practiced on land carry over to stroke actions in the pool when swimming directly follows land activities. Finally, many believe that swimmers who swim regularly after a strength training develop better endurance, as swimming, which builds endurance very well, becomes an extension of a “super workout” begun on land, requiring the swimmer to adapt to a greater workload. On the other hand, some believe that since swimming elongates the muscles, strength work that follows swimming ensures that the

training develop better endurance, as swimming, which builds endurance very well, becomes an extension of a “super workout” begun on land, requiring the swimmer to adapt to a greater workload. On the other hand, some believe that since swimming elongates the muscles, strength work that follows swimming ensures that the swimmer’s muscles are well warmed up and less vulnerable to injury from the demands of land training. They also argue that when strength training follows the water workout, the quality of the swimming is higher because a swimmer who is tired after strength training practices swimming slower, with less force, power and explosiveness, reinforcing undesirable habits. Finally, many take the position that swimming first allows the swimmer to feel and utilize the strength that he or she has adapted to in the water where it counts. So which is best? There are valid arguments for both. From the perspective of preparing a swimmer to race, to be ready to perform under less than ideal conditions, including poor weather, crowded warm-up areas and meet delays, a program that uses a bit of both approaches should be considered. By mixing it up, the swimmer will practice adapting to different situations. Further, changing the order of the training routine from time to time will keep it from becoming boring, as the swimmer will stay challenged to perform under different circumstances. The final decision should be based on what best works for the individual athlete. 99 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 99 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 102 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Scheduling rest time is as important as scheduling workout time. Even routines based solely on self-resistance work should allow at least two days off per week. When the content of the strength work includes external load, at least three rest days are

should be done with the specific objective of the swimmer in mind. 100 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 100 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 103 Text --- The Fundamentals START RIGHT SAFETY Like the “No Diving” sign at the shallow end of the pool, safety rules are there for a reason. Although you may be lucky diving into shallow water, the consequences are real and grave. When safety rules for conduct and equipment use are in place, observe them with respect. If safety rules are not in place, it is the responsibility of the supervisor to establish them. Supervision is a must, especially when children and inexperienced swimmers are engaged in strength training activities. The supervisor must ensure that safety rules are understood and followed. The supervisor must ensure that each activity is performed correctly and safely by each swimmer. The supervisor must ensure that each activity is appropriate for the swimmer’s stage of development and experience. Everyone engaged in strength training should use a proactive approach to preventing accidents by: Training With a Partner All strength training, especially with weights, should be done with a partner who can spot and assist, and observe technique. Handling Weights Correctly Lift weights from the floor using your legs rather than your back. Weights should never be dropped; hey can break bones. They should also not be left on the floor to trip on. Medicine balls should never be thrown at the face or the groin, only at the chest and when the person is looking. Wearing Shoes Although most swimmers are very comfortable in bare feet around the pool deck, shoes should be mandatory for any strength training activity involving external weight or moving with impact on the feet. While many exercises can be done safely without shoes on the pool deck or gym, it

page 94-95. If stretching is done at all, it should be done after exercise. It should be very conservative and target only the large muscles, not the joints. Even this kind of stretching should be gentle and gradual. Under no circumstances should any bouncing action be used. Under no circumstances should another swimmer apply external stretching pressure for you. Under no circumstances should stretching hurt, either during or after you do it. 103 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 103 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 106 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming When exercise machines are available, warm-ups can include: • Exercise Bike • Elliptical Trainer • Treadmill COOL DOWN Just as after swimming, the cool down is important to let body systems and muscles adjust to the resting state. After exercise, allow several minutes of slow, continuous activity so the heart rate can return to normal and the muscles can begin to relax. One of the best cool down activities is walking. FORM Form is as important in strength training as it is in the water. Form determines the manner in which the swimmer’s body interacts with the resistance. It is important to spend time perfecting the swimmer’s form on any particular exercise before it is repeated over and over. Correct form ensures that the swimmer will use the intended muscles groups in the intended fashion. Incorrect form can lead to poor results, including injury. POSTURE Our symmetrical bodies are designed with many bilateral muscles, including the lats, the obliques, the pectoralis major and the deltoids, among others. However, when one part of our body is out of alignment, the mirror image muscles are very adept at taking over the work. Repeated exercise with poor posture can result in bilateral muscles developing unevenly as one side compensates for the other. As swimming

major and the deltoids, among others. However, when one part of our body is out of alignment, the mirror image muscles are very adept at taking over the work. Repeated exercise with poor posture can result in bilateral muscles developing unevenly as one side compensates for the other. As swimming depends on bilateral strength, maintaining good posture is very important. 104 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 104 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 107 Text --- The Fundamentals Good posture starts with the awareness of your body position and stance. One of the most positive steps you can take is to develop core strength that stabilizes posture from the front and the back. This will help keep shoulders, hips and knees in alignment, encouraging strength to be developed in a more balanced manner. BREATHING Breathing function is an essential part of athletic performance. Posture plays an important part in good breathing function. Bad posture encumbers breathing capacity by allowing the trunk of the body to be compressed, leaving less room for the lungs to expand and contract. One of the quickest and best ways to improve your breathing during exercise is to stand up straight. Breathing rhythm is very important. Just as we use rhythmic breathing in the pool, it should also be used during strength training. Avoid holding the breath during exertion. Instead, just like swimming, and most all other sports, exhale during exertion and inhale during recovery. Exchanging air properly will keep your muscles better supplied with the oxygen they need to perform. It will also keep you from fatiguing as quickly. CONTROL It is important to control every movement against resistance, both in the power phase and recovery. Always maintain balance and stability during the power phase. Always return to the starting position gently and with less speed. Never allow an

done regularly in terms of load, number of repetitions and sets and rate will allow us to track our progress. The Strength Training Log presented on page 162 provides a basic structure for tracking progress. Make copies and use one sheet per month to record your strength training progress over time. At the beginning of each month, fill in the exercises that you will track on the left side of the page. Then, after each strength training session throughout the month, record your results for those exercises. Record the number of sets, repetitions or other information specific to the exercise for comparison. At the end of the month, do a test set to gauge adaptation. A test set takes three of the exercises you have been doing throughout the month and increases the difficulty of each. The exact way the difficulty is increased depends on the objective. For instance, if your objective is more force, more load would be attempted. If your objective is tempo, more repetitions would be attempted in a fixed time. At the bottom of the Progress Log, a space is provided to record the results of a monthly test set. If test set results show that you are able to perform the exercises with increased difficulty, then as you begin a new month of strength training, use the test set degree of difficulty as your new base. Remember to focus on your objective. If you are training for more force, don’t expect to see much progress in terms of number of repetitions. Look instead for progress in terms of amount of resistance. If you are training for more power, don’t expect to see much progress in terms of the load. Look instead for rate, or number of repetitions. Progress tracked that does not meet the objective,

Not top-level racers striving for national championships or dreaming of Olympic glory. Ordinary swimmers. The ones who fall somewhere between Becky Adlington and people who would only swim if they fell out of a boat. In other words, most of us. IS THIS BOOK FOR YOU? There are lots of good books on swimming out there. To work out if this particular one will help you, ask yourself if you fit into one of these categories: • Are you a keen swimmer who turns up at the pool and regularly swims for half an hour or more, getting fitter and fitter – but never much faster? • Does it feel as though you’re splashing your way up and down the pool, while you notice the really good swimmers smoothly gliding along? • Would you like to be able to do triathlons, but find the swim leg so daunting that it puts you off? • Do you find swimming front crawl so tiring that you can only manage a couple of lengths at a time – even though you can swim breaststroke for ages? • Are you aiming to take part

triathlons, but find the swim leg so daunting that it puts you off? • Do you find swimming front crawl so tiring that you can only manage a couple of lengths at a time – even though you can swim breaststroke for ages? • Are you aiming to take part in a long swim for charity and feeling nervous about completing the distance, or maybe wishing you could swim front crawl instead of breaststroke? If you read one or more of these and felt a flash of recognition, Swim Better, Swim Faster can help. SIX SIMPLE ELEMENTS Swim Better, Swim Faster separates front crawl into six key elements. Work on just one of these for even a few hours, and you should feel an improvement in your stroke: --- Page 7 Text --- 1. Flexibility 2. Body position 3. Arm stroke 4. Breathing 5. Kicking 6. Stroke and rhythm People often feel that they have a particular problem with one of these areas, and concentrate on that. But the trick with swimming is to get all the elements of your stroke working together smoothly and in balance. Work on all six over a period of time, and your swimming will quickly improve. TURNS As well as swimming technique, Swim Better, Swim Faster has advice on turns: • Many pool swimmers would like to learn tumble turns, which are a great way of getting more out of your time in the pool. • Triathletes taking part in cold-weather races often do the swim leg in a pool. In some triathlons swimmers are banned from doing tumble turns – but it’s still possible to make up a lot of time by doing the fastest possible touch turn.

the swim leg in a pool. In some triathlons swimmers are banned from doing tumble turns – but it’s still possible to make up a lot of time by doing the fastest possible touch turn. Top tip The advice and drills in Swim Better, Swim Faster will make you a good freestyle swimmer. But improvement doesn’t stop there. BECOME YOUR OWN COACH This really works: after over 40 years of swimming, I still think about my technique on just about every length I swim, try new things, and develop new ways of training. Always be careful, though, about picking up bits and pieces of advice from the internet. There’s more than one style of swimming front crawl. The technique in this book is good for swimming middle and longer distances, but --- Page 8 Text --- may not be what a typical sprinter would use. Mixing and matching from different styles isn’t likely to help your stroke. OPEN WATER Open-water swimming – in lakes, rivers and the sea – is a fast-growing area of the sport. The back-to-nature vibe, and the fact that it’s generally free, fits the spirit of the times. But if you’re used to pools, swimming in open water requires adaptations to your approach. You also need one or two extra pieces of equipment. See Chapter 9 to find out more. RAPID IMPROVEMENTS Putting Swim Better, Swim Faster into action should lead to noticeable gains within a relatively short time. Swimmers often report a measureable improvement within three or four hours. Within 10 to 12 hours, most people find their stroke has become smoother and more efficient. To help you get maximum benefit from the book, at the back you’ll find suggested suggested training sessions. Each session focuses on a different aspect of your front-crawl style, and

three or four hours. Within 10 to 12 hours, most people find their stroke has become smoother and more efficient. To help you get maximum benefit from the book, at the back you’ll find suggested suggested training sessions. Each session focuses on a different aspect of your front-crawl style, and is between 20 and 40 minutes long. If you have more time than this, it’s easy to combine the main sets from different sessions together. FOCUS YOUR TRAINING Always distinguish working on your technique from training for fitness. You learn new techniques best when fresh and rested. Never nail technique work onto the end of a fitness-based session: you’ll be too tired to do the work properly. USING THE BOOK Each of the technique sections of this book has the same structure: • First there’s an introduction to the subject and the key elements that will improve your stroke, saying what you’re trying to achieve. • There’s also information on some of the common problems swimmers experience, and suggestions for ways to check which areas you need to work on. --- Page 9 Text --- • Finally, there are drills that will help you to improve. If there’s more than one drill, the simplest and/or most basic comes first, then they get steadily more advanced. A poor kicking style, with very bent knees. This will hold the swimmer back by creating drag and affecting her body position. She needs to remember the coaching maxim ‘kick water not air’ This swimmer has a much neater swimming technique: most of the movement comes from her hips, not her knees, and she is kicking mostly underwater with only her heels breaking the surface. --- Page 10 Text --- SWIMMING IS SIMPLE swim verb float, glide, slip, stroke, submerge, move or propel yourself through

has a much neater swimming technique: most of the movement comes from her hips, not her knees, and she is kicking mostly underwater with only her heels breaking the surface. --- Page 10 Text --- SWIMMING IS SIMPLE swim verb float, glide, slip, stroke, submerge, move or propel yourself through water using natural means such as arms and legs At heart, swimming is simple. The basic techniques – arm pull and recovery, kick, and body movement – aren’t especially complicated. But unless you’ve been a competitive swimmer, you probably don’t really have a clear idea of what you should be trying to achieve. This chapter gives you that information. WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR Aim for a smooth stroke, your body rolling from side to side with each arm stroke, but always straight and level in the water. Breathing should be a seamless --- OCR from Page 10 Image 1 --- ea . * gent ye 2 nee --- Page 11 Text --- part of the side-to-side roll that comes with each arm stroke. Your legs kick in a rhythm that matches your arms. FRONT CRAWL ARM PULL Each front crawl arm pull should be a smooth arm movement. However, when thinking about your technique it’s useful to divide each arm stroke into four stages: 1. Entry 2. Catch 3. Pull 4. Recovery The underwater part of each stroke begins slow and gets faster. Your hand accelerates, moving faster as you reach the end of the pull. Stage 1: Entry Your arm enters the water fingertips first, with the thumb side angled slightly downward. It goes in level with your shoulder (rather than your nose). Your hand then stretches forward, still off centre, and turns so that it’s flat to the bottom of the pool. Stage 2: Catch Your arm begins

### SWIM BETTER SWIM FASTER_full_text.txt
my body rolling from side to side like his/hers? BODY POSITION Your body should always be in a straight line pointing toward the end of the pool, like a pencil floating on the surface. One common way of expressing this is to imagine you’re a human kebab, with an unbendable metal stick running from head to heels. You may prefer to imagine your body is contained in a tube: you can rotate inside it, but you mustn’t touch the sides. KICKING Kicking for front crawl is the opposite of what Austrian ski instructors always used to shout: do not bend the knees. At least, not deliberately. Big knee-based kicks create so much turbulence and drag that they actually slow you down. They also wreak havoc with your body position, wagging your bottom about or causing your hips to drop. Instead aim to kick from your hips. Keep your knees stiff (but not rigid) and your ankles relaxed. Front crawl swimmers generally use one, two or three kicks per arm stroke. Two works well for most people, but it’s more important that your technique is good than that you match a particular number. --- Page 15 Text --- Front crawl kick is done in a smooth, continuous movement. Notice how the swimmer always has one leg almost straight, while the other is only ever slightly bent. This is because she is kicking from the hips, not the knees. The swimmer’s feet never break the surface: every up and down movement acts on the water, not the air. Big splashes may look fast, but in reality they usually slow you down. EQUIPMENT One of the nice things about swimming is that you don’t have to drag loads of equipment around with you. Two things that are essential, if you don’t own them

have to use two stacked up. • Swimming snorkel, which rises in front of your face and is handy in some drills and for practising kick. If you use one of these, you’ll also need a nose clip. --- Page 17 Text --- • Ankle band: this is a rubber band that goes around your ankles, making sure you don’t cheat when you’re supposed to be swimming arms-only. You can make these out of old bike inner tubes. • A rubber hat if you have long hair (which otherwise will drag and affect your head position). If you’re taking part in a triathlon, a specialist tri-suit, which can be worn during all three legs – swim, bike and run – is useful. In cold water, triathletes swim wearing a wetsuit, which makes you more streamlined and buoyant. Keys to success • Count your strokes on every length to get an idea of how your stroke is working. As your stroke becomes more efficient, your should find you are taking fewer strokes per length when swimming at the same pool. • Swim with a smooth arm and leg action, moving continuously; avoid jerky, splashy actions • Keep your body straight. Side-to-side roll is good, but twisting and kinking is bad --- Page 19 Text --- FLEXIBILITY flexible adj. lissom, supple, lithe, elastic, able to bend or be bent repeatedly without damage or injury This chapter comes before the technique sections for a reason. Put simply, if you lack flexibility, there are some elements of swimming technique you’ll never be able to manage. People with stiff neck, shoulders and back find it particularly hard to master technique, but overall flexibility is important in swimming.

some elements of swimming technique you’ll never be able to manage. People with stiff neck, shoulders and back find it particularly hard to master technique, but overall flexibility is important in swimming. STRETCHING TECHNIQUES Never do any stretch to a point where it hurts. You need to be able to feel a bit of --- Page 20 Text --- pull in the muscles you’re stretching, but if it starts to hurt, gently ease out of the stretch and try again. It’s best to time your movement into the stretch to happen as you breathe out. If you need to take a breath, stop moving while you breathe in. Use your breath When you’ve taken a stretch as far as is comfortable, concentrate on breathing deeply, from your stomach rather than your chest. It helps you relax and get a little more from the stretch. INCREASING FLEXIBILITY To improve their swimming, most people also need to improve their general flexibility. A great way to do this is to take a yoga course. There are lots of different schools of yoga: a gentle one may be best. Scaravelli yoga seems to be useful for swimming, but it’s not that common, and it can be hard to find courses. Hatha yoga is a good alternative. The exercises on the following pages are mainly targeted at swimming (apart from the sun salute for general flexibility). You can do them just about anywhere: sitting in front of the TV, on the poolside, out in the garden. Try to do some flexibility work every day – 15 minutes spent on this pays dividends in the pool. WARMING UP AND WARMING DOWN As well as using stretches to improve your flexibility, make them part of every swimming session. Spend 10 minutes at the start and finish of

for balance. Hold the stretch while you breathe deeply several times, release your foot and let it swing gently forward. Repeat using the other leg. Take care with this stretch not to arch your lower back when you pull your foot in: your hips should stay level with the ground. --- Page 37 Text --- Leg stretch 3. WARMING UP Stretching has a part to play in warming up before a training session (whether it’s a technique session or a fitness one). Lots of English people feel embarrassed about stretching on the side of the pool – it’s seen as a bit effete or unnecessary. But warming up properly prepares your body for exercise, making injury much less likely. Warming up – legs If you can, one of the best ways of getting your body systems going before a swimming session is to cycle to the pool. A distance of about 10km will wake your muscles up to the fact that they’re exercising, prepare the joints in your hips, knees and ankles, and lift your heart rate. Don’t race: just go at a speed that would make holding a conversation moderately tricky. Once you get to the pool, you’ll need to stretch your hamstrings a bit, because cycling only offers them a limited range of movement. Leg stretch 2 is good for this. --- Page 38 Text --- Most people have one area of their body that needs a little extra flexibility work. If you’re a keen cyclist it may be your hamstrings. If you sit at a desk all day, that can result in tight hip flexor muscles. If you do have an area of particular inflexibility, it’s worth getting expert advice about how to address it, because the problem doesn’t always originate from the place where you can

roughly the same level in the water, just below the surface. Most people naturally hold their body a little bit bent forward, so to be dead flat you have to slightly extend your chest, stomach and hips, as in the streamlined position drill. Hip dragger or bottom waggler? Swimmers with their chest and hips in an inefficient, draggy position are a common sight in pools around the world. The two key problems are dragging your hips (swimming with them lower in the water than your chest), and lifting your hips so that your bottom sticks up. It’s hard to know for yourself if you have either of these problems, so ask a friend to watch you swim and tell you. Hip draggers: Hip dragging is often caused by a poor catch, a weak or poor leg --- Page 47 Text --- kick (for advice on how to improve this, see here) or a too-high head position. It’s often also linked to a lack of flexibility in your hips: see the hip torso stretches that can help improve this. Bottom wagglers: Bottom waggling often happens when swimmers have a poor kicking technique or a too-low head position. Using the head position just mentioned may get rid of the problem. It’s also useful to work on improving extension through the chest and stomach, pushing down slightly with the buttocks and opening the hips. This should bring your head and shoulders forward and up, and your bottom down.

drill; to get benefit from it, you need to listen hard to your own body. This always applies in swimming, of course – try to feel how the water presses against your skin, where there’s more resistance and where least. Water resistance is your enemy: any way you can find to avoid it will improve your swimming. What you need • Swim fins • A swimming snorkel 1. Put on your fins, and push off into the streamlined position. Lay one hand on top of the other, and look at the bottom of the pool rather than looking ahead. Many swimmers find that the most streamlined head position looks down more than they expected. 2. Kick with a steady rhythm, fast enough to feel the water resistance as you move ahead. Make sure you’re always kicking water, with no more than your heels breaking the surface. 3. Experiment with different head, shoulder, hip and foot positions to see how they affect water resistance. Try pressing down with your chest, extending through the stomach, tightening up your back and bottom – but always come back to the streamlined position (and float position). --- Page 52 Text --- Top tip COUNT YOUR STROKES Counting your strokes is a good guide to how efficient your technique is becoming. As your swimming gets smoother and more streamlined, it will take fewer strokes for you to complete a length at a given speed. (Usually your stroke count rises slightly as you swim faster.) This is a rough guide to what stroke counts by an adult swimmer in a 25m pool might indicate: 25+ strokes per length: Taking this many strokes would generally mean there’s plenty of room for improvement in your technique and streamlining. 20–24 strokes per length: Although at the lower end of this

a rough guide to what stroke counts by an adult swimmer in a 25m pool might indicate: 25+ strokes per length: Taking this many strokes would generally mean there’s plenty of room for improvement in your technique and streamlining. 20–24 strokes per length: Although at the lower end of this scale your stroke is getting pretty efficient, there are likely still to be things you can do to improve your technique. 19 strokes or fewer: This is the sort of stroke count that will look lazy to other people, but can still move you pretty quickly down the pool. These are not rigid guidelines: some swimmers (even Olympic champions) have a high stroke count per length, while some poor swimmers have a low one. If you naturally swim with a high stroke count, don’t punish yourself trying to lower it to 15. It will still be worth counting strokes, though, as the logic applies: developing a more efficient stroke will lead to a lower count. BODY ROLL Freestyle is sometimes called front crawl – a misleading name, as you shouldn’t be spending very much time actually on your front. It should really be called --- Page 53 Text --- side crawl, because most of your time is spent with your body rolled to one side or the other. Be careful not to confuse body roll (good) with twist (so bad it should be sent to bed without any supper). Your body should keep a straight-line shape as much as possible, but your torso spins around the imaginary straight line running from your head to your feet. There are three big advantages to rolling your body with each stroke. First, you’re more streamlined and slip through the water using less energy. Second, the roll helps your leading hand extend further forward

but your torso spins around the imaginary straight line running from your head to your feet. There are three big advantages to rolling your body with each stroke. First, you’re more streamlined and slip through the water using less energy. Second, the roll helps your leading hand extend further forward at the front of your stroke, adding to your pull. Third, it makes a smooth breathing action easier to achieve. Swimmer rolled to the side, breathing. Swimmer rolled to the same side, not breathing. Notice how the amount of body roll is similar in both photos See for yourself: Body roll and reach It’s easy to show how rolling your body extends the reach of your stroke: • Stand square to a table, about a metre away, and bend forward so that your --- Page 54 Text --- torso’s parallel to the ground • Reach toward the table with one arm, as you would at the front of your freestyle stroke, but keeping your shoulders square • Now turn your shoulders, so that the one reaching out drops and the other one rises See how much dropping your shoulder adds to your reach? These drills will help you develop good body roll as part of your stroke. In the second drill, the body roll is linked to taking a breath. This helps develop good, smooth breathing technique. Don’t forget, though – you roll with every stroke, not only the ones when you take a breath. Body roll drill 1 This drill allows you to get a feel for swimming in a streamlined position on your side. What you need • Pool with a line along the bottom (always try to swim straight along the line) • Swim fins 1. Push off, and take one arm pull with your right arm.

### SWIM BETTER SWIM FASTER_full_text.txt
Kick your legs 10 times, then take a stroke with your left arm while recovering your right arm. As you do this, your body rolls to the other side and you can take a breath. 3. Repeat this drill all the way down the length of the pool. --- Page 57 Text --- Top tip As a way of controlling your head angle, USE YOUR VISION Swim looking down at the bottom of the pool. Then, as you turn your head to breathe, aim to have your vision across the line of the water’s surface. You should see the world on its side: if it looks like normal, you have tilted your head up to breathe (like the swimmer above) and compromised your streamlined position. THE ENERGY-SAPPING EVILS OF TWIST ‘Twist’ is when your spine bends from side to side as you swim. Twist in your swimming stroke slows you down. It increases drag, and forces you to use more energy than necessary to move forward. ONE SIDE OR BOTH? Ask a friend to watch you swim, from head-on and from behind. They can tell --- Page 58 Text --- you if your stroke has twist in it, and whether the twist is to one side or both sides. Twist to one side If the twist is only on one side, it is often linked to the swimmer’s breathing technique. They are usually breathing only to one side of their body, which makes it harder to swim with a balanced stroke. The advice in this section will help solve the problem, but if your stroke only twists one way, it would also be a good idea to start breathing bilaterally. See for yourself: twist It’s easy to demonstrate to yourself how twist affects your stroke: • Push off the side

a single complete movement of the arms and/or legs A lot of swimmers barely think about their arm stroke. Others look into the subject and quickly find themselves confused by the variety of advice on offer: should your hand pull in an S-shape, under your body or not, what kind of recovery should you use, and so on. In this section, you’ll learn a style of arm stroke that strikes a good balance between power and streamlining. --- Page 63 Text --- WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR We have already described the WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR of a good freestyle pulling action. Overall, the key elements of the freestyle arm stroke are: • Hand entry into the water • The path your hand takes through the water, which can be divided into three phases: catch, in-sweep and out-sweep • Hand shape while pulling • Exit from the water and recovery REDUCE DRAG, SWIM BETTER In swimming, drag is your number one enemy. Reducing drag trumps anything else you can do to improve your technique. In your arm stroke, you can reduce drag by using a high-elbow pull. Using this, your hand enters the water in front of your shoulder. Then the path traced through the water by your hand stays outside the edge of your body for much of its time underwater. --- Page 64 Text --- Many swimmers use a different pull, in which they put their hand into the water right on the centre line of their body, and pull in a shape that curves in under their torso. This is more powerful than the high-elbow pull, but it creates a lot of drag. The high-elbow pull is more streamlined, smoother, uses less energy, and makes it easier to swim at a sustained speed. This makes it especially useful

pull in a shape that curves in under their torso. This is more powerful than the high-elbow pull, but it creates a lot of drag. The high-elbow pull is more streamlined, smoother, uses less energy, and makes it easier to swim at a sustained speed. This makes it especially useful for distance swims, open water and triathlon. Side-on view of swimmer with high-elbow action; this is also called ‘early vertical forearm’ technique, because the elbow is close to the surface and the forearm is pointing straight down HAND ENTRY Each freestyle arm stroke begins when your hand enters the water. For a high- elbow stroke, your hand needs to go in roughly in line with your shoulder. Try to slide your hand below the surface without making a big splash, by angling it slightly thumb-down. There’s no need to worry too much about this, but a big, splashy hand entry means you’re wasting energy by hitting against the water. Once your hand has slid into the water, your shoulder extends and moves down, starting your body’s roll to the side and allowing you to reach further ahead. At this point your hand should still be in line with your shoulder, and the back of your hand should be just below the surface. --- Page 65 Text --- Angled hand entry Extended arm with flat hand --- Page 66 Text --- This swimmer is using a single-arm drill to work on his pulling action. UNDERWATER ACTION Your underwater action should be one smooth movement, with your hand accelerating toward the end of the pull. It’s useful, though, to separate the underwater action into three phases: • Catch, in which your arm moves into a position in which it can start to add significant propulsion. • In-sweep, in which your elbow is

The next two drills will help you introduce the high-elbow technique into the catch phase of your stroke. Lane line initiation In this drill, your elbow is kept high because it’s hooked over a lane rope. This gives you a feel for initiating the catch phase with a high-elbow position. What you need • A tight, supportive lane rope 1. Holding on to the lane rope, place yourself at an angle of 90° to it. Float with your body at the surface in a streamlined position, kicking gently toward the rope to keep your hips and legs up. Have your arms extended in front of you. 2. Move forward so that one arm is over the rope, with the rope resting just behind the elbow. You need to be as close as possible to the position you’d take when starting an arm stroke. 3. With your head down as it would be when you’re swimming, pull down and back with the arm that’s hooked over the rope. --- Page 74 Text --- High-elbow scull Try this drill next, and focus on keeping your elbows high. 1. Push off in a streamlined position, as you would to swim freestyle. Allow your hands to drift shoulder-width apart, so that each is in the starting position for a stroke. 2. Keeping your elbows high, use a circular sculling motion with your hand and forearm. Each hand moves slightly out, back in and toward your chest, and then forward to return to its

The root cause is usually problems elsewhere in their stroke: if you get your body position, arm stroke and leg kick right, breathing fits naturally into the rhythm of your swimming. Even so, it’s important to stay aware not only of how you breathe, but also why. WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR --- Page 90 Text --- The key to breathing technique in freestyle is that it should be part of the general movement of your stroke. Unless you manage this, every time you take a breath it throws your whole technique out of balance, which causes drag and slows you down. • Aim for a smooth turn of the head; really no more than a slight addition to the roll of your body as you take a stroke. • Keep your neck at the same angle as usual: you’re aiming to turn your head to the side slightly, not to lift it from the water.

It’s hard work at first, and you’ll probably need to increase your capacity for aerobic swimming. This exercise is really more a way of achieving this than a technique drill, but it will help you to maintain a three-stroke breathing pattern. What you need • Fins are useful at first: discard them as you get more comfortable with the drill 1. Swim in three-length units. Give yourself a rest of 10 seconds between each length. Swim the first length breathing every three strokes, the second breathing every five strokes, and the third every seven strokes. You don’t need to be going full tilt, but don’t dawdle along either: this is meant to be a lung buster. 2. Give yourself a 30-second rest, then repeat. 3. Over a period of weeks and months, make things harder, aiming to increase the difficulty whenever you feel you’ve got this one nailed. First, lose the fins. Next, drop the rest between lengths. Then swim in six-length units (3– 5–7, 3–5–7) without a rest between them. --- Page 103 Text --- Keys to success • Time your breath to fit in with the roll of your body • Remember to keep a streamlined head position • Turn your head to breathe – don’t lift it --- Page 104 Text --- • Only turn as far as you need for a breath – keep one goggle in the water at all times --- Page 105 Text ---

This isn’t all that surprising. We tend to think that it’s just using the same muscles as we use for walking around. In fact, a freestyle leg kick requires a very specific technique, strength and fitness. Get this right, and many of the other pieces of your stroke quickly fall into place. WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR The leg kick for freestyle is called a flutter kick. You kick from the hips (never the knees, though the knees do bend), causing your feet to flutter on relaxed --- Page 106 Text --- ankles at the end of fairly straight legs. You give a strong kick at the end of your arm recovery, on the opposite side. (This happens automatically and is not something you need to do consiously.) A good leg kick is a bit like the egg in a cake mix: leave it out, and the rest of the ingredients won’t stick together. The key functions of freestyle leg kick are: • Aiding a good, flat body position in the water • Balancing your arm stroke • Adding propulsion, or forward drive, to your stroke – the kick’s least important job, as it provides less than a tenth of your propulsion The flutter kick isn’t a big, splashy kick. One of the most common

good, flat body position in the water • Balancing your arm stroke • Adding propulsion, or forward drive, to your stroke – the kick’s least important job, as it provides less than a tenth of your propulsion The flutter kick isn’t a big, splashy kick. One of the most common mistakes people make is to do a large, deliberate kick from the knee, bending it almost as if they’re kicking a football. Kicking like this causes drag, affects your body position and upsets your arm technique. It’s like pulling a sea anchor along behind you. KICKING RHYTHM In freestyle, kicking rhythm is counted over a cycle of two arm strokes (one stroke by each arm). This means kicking once every arm stroke gives you a two- beat kick, twice equals a four-beat kick and three times gives a six-beat kick. Each rhythm has advantages, depending on the kind of swimming you do and your ability level. Six-beat kick This rhythm provides a good level of propulsion and balances the rest of the stroke extremely well. It can, though, be very tiring at first, which makes it most suited to competitive swimmers with a good, efficient technique. Four-beat kick This is a good basic rhythm. It provides a combination of balancing your stroke, conserving energy and providing a bit of forward power. Two-beat kick This provides little or no propulsion, but uses very little energy. The two-beat kick is used mainly by distance swimmers, who place a premium on endurance. --- Page 107 Text --- The turbulence of a two-beat kick The turbulence of a four-beat kick The turbulence of a six-beat kick KICK TRAINING PRINCIPLES There are a few principles that are worth sticking to when doing technique training for the flutter kick. 1 Try not to swim head-up Even

Page 107 Text --- The turbulence of a two-beat kick The turbulence of a four-beat kick The turbulence of a six-beat kick KICK TRAINING PRINCIPLES There are a few principles that are worth sticking to when doing technique training for the flutter kick. 1 Try not to swim head-up Even in most swimming clubs you’ll see swimmers doing freestyle kick training with their arms resting on a float and their head sticking up in the air. You don’t swim freestyle with your head up in the air – if possible, don’t train your body to kick in this unnatural position. Of course, swimming with your face in the water does make breathing tricky. The best way round the problem is to use a special swimming snorkel, which instead of going to the side of your head rises in front of your nose and forehead. --- Page 108 Text --- With a swimming snorkel you can concentrate on keeping a nice, flat body position, rather than lifting your head to breathe every few seconds. Using a swimming snorkel in public does require a certain degree of self-confidence, as it makes you look like an extra from a sci-fi movie. There are significant benefits though. 2 Use fins sparingly Swim fins are a good training aid: they are useful in supporting your body during arm drills, and in fitness work they load your legs and build strength. Unfortunately, fins are also the crack cocaine of the swimming world: highly addictive. Nothing beats the feeling of bombing down the pool like a turbocharged human/seal hybrid. Watch out you don’t get hooked. Overusing fins gives your body a false idea of what can be expected from your legs. Then, once you take them off, your technique falls apart. --- Page 109 Text --- Fins

Then, once you take them off, your technique falls apart. --- Page 109 Text --- Fins are a useful training aid – just don’t overuse them or your stroke will start to feel strange when you take them off. Top tip KICK WATER — NOT AIR! It can be tempting to make a big splash with your kick: it feels like you must be generating lots of speed. But you’re swimming in water, not air. Any time your feet come out of the water, they’re waving at the spectators rather than driving you forward. --- Page 110 Text --- Kicking: setting the flutter kick Doing this drill several times allows you to set the muscle memory for how a flutter kick should feel. It’s also useful if you feel your kick has gone off-track in some way: just haul out on the side of the pool and run through the exercise. What you need • A clear poolside with a raised edge (this drill is harder in pools where the deck is the same height as the water surface) 1. Sit on the edge of the pool, with your bottom on the deck and your thighs clear of it. Lean back and rest your weight on your hands, then extend your legs out straight over the water. --- Page 111 Text --- 2. Point your toes, and keep your legs close together. Lower your feet until they’re about 30 cm underwater. Make sure your toes are still pointed. 3. Keeping your legs straight, lift one foot steadily up, but don’t let it break the surface. Lower

that’s well out of your depth. Cross your arms over your chest, palms flat. Kick hard to keep your head above water, using the flutter kick described at the start of this chapter. Take care not to start using an eggbeater kick, a kind of alternate breaststroke kick used by water polo players to lift their torsos out of the water. Ideally, try to maintain the exercise for at least 30 seconds before stopping for a 15-second rest, then repeating it. Doing this a total of five or six times each session should be enough. --- Page 114 Text --- Version 1 – least tough. Version 2 – harder In this version of the drill, instead of crossing your arms over your chest you lift your hands free of the water. Just keep your hands and forearms in the air, with your elbows below the surface. Version 2 – harder. --- Page 115 Text --- Version 3 – very testing This time, instead of putting only your hands in the air, lift up both arms into the streamlined position. You’ll have to kick very hard even to get your head above water for a breath. Only try this version when you’re comfortably able to complete five or six repetitions of the second iteration of this drill. Otherwise you risk swallowing a magnum of pool water and putting yourself off swimming forever. Version 3 – very testing.

Lie on your back, with your hands tucked under your bottom, lifting your hips slightly. 2. Raise your legs straight off the ground by about 20 cm, and flutter your feet, flicking your ankles as fast as you can. Do this without consciously bending your knees: try to make the movement come from the hips and thighs. 3. Keep this up – with your feet fluttering as fast as you can possibly manage – for 30 seconds. This is when having someone else there for encouragement helps! 4. Lower your legs and have a rest for one minute. Repeat at least once. As you get better at this drill, build up the time from 30 seconds to a minute and increase the number of repetitions you do. --- Page 117 Text --- Top tip FLEX YOUR ANKLES Ankle flexibility is a crucial part of the flutter kick. Improve yours by sitting with your ankle over your knee, gripping your heel and toes, and winding your foot in circles first one way, then the other, for a minute in each direction before changing feet. Kicking: building strength (part 2) This is an advanced land-based drill, which helps improve both leg strength for kicking and core body strength.

Lie flat on your back with your arms by your sides. Bend forward, and with a slight rocking-back motion get your hips in the air, supported on your hands. Your elbows should be below your hips, resting on the floor. Your legs will be in the air, knees bent. Your weight rests on your hips and shoulders. --- Page 118 Text --- 2. Straighten your legs so that they point up in the air. Gently lower your right leg forward and your left leg slightly backward. The two movements should balance each other out, allowing you to stay comfortably upright. 3. Bring both legs back to vertical, then perform the same movement in reverse. Take care to move slowly, to keep your hips solidly planted on your hands, and not to extend your legs too far and topple over. Repeat the movement five times on each side, alternating sides, then gently let yourself roll back to a sitting position. --- Page 119 Text --- Keys to success • Use small flutter kicks, not big splashy ones • Kick from the hips, not the knees • Kick without breaking the surface of the water with your toes • Keep your ankles loose and relaxed --- Page 120 Text --- STROKE AND RHYTHM rhythm noun pace, tempo, cadence, pulse, a regularly recurring pattern of activity, or repeated functions of the body In this last key section, the focus is on fitting everything together: combining good body position, arm stroke, breathing and leg kick into a smooth, easy, efficient style.

To recap the basic elements of a good freestyle swimming technique: • Keep your body straight and flat in the water • Swim with your neck in line with your spine, looking at the bottom of the pool rather than the wall • Put each hand into the water in line with your shoulder, and begin the pull with a high elbow. Avoid pulling in underneath your body • Move arm and hand through the catch, in-sweep and out-sweep phases with increasing speed • Kick your legs in a continuous flutter kick, kicking from the hips without --- Page 122 Text --- consciously bending your knees Head position, breathing At first, most swimmers find this drill something between very tricky and impossible because they’re used to swimming with their head held too high. It does come to you pretty quickly, though, and it’s a really good drill to return to again and again. It reminds you of good head position, body roll and breathing technique. What you need: • A small, not-too-squishy ball, a bit bigger than a tennis ball 1.

What you need: • A small, not-too-squishy ball, a bit bigger than a tennis ball 1. Tuck the ball between your chin and your chest. 2. Push off, and start swimming. Try to keep the ball in place, not only as you swim along but also when you breathe. 3. Don’t tense up: remember to keep your jaw and neck relaxed. You’re aiming to hold the ball in place, rather than clamping it tightly down. --- Page 124 Text --- Three-quarter catch-up This simple drill is good for many elements of your stroke. It emphasises the extension and glide of the hand entry and catch phases of your stroke. The drill is also a good way to develop roll and breath timing, and done without fins it plays up the role of your leg kick in maintaining a good body position. This drill can be hard work aerobically when done without fins, so is probably best tackled one length at a time, with a 15-second rest between lengths.

I call this the Tarzan-and-Jane drill, because I started doing it when I was a kid, after seeing Jonny Weissmuller and Maureen O’Sullivan, as Tarzan and Jane, swimming like this in a jungle pool. --- Page 127 Text --- What you need • Swimming pool with line along the bottom 1. Push off along the line, and take one stroke of front crawl. Reach ahead with your arm and let your body start to roll to the side as usual. 2. Instead of stopping the roll, let your body turn right over on to your back, with your leading arm still extended. Then take a stroke of backstroke with the other arm. 3. Continue the rolling motion in the same direction back on to your front, taking another stroke of front crawl. 4. Restart the sequence of the same three strokes – front–back–front – by taking another stroke on your front with the opposite arm. All the way down the length, aim to keep swimming above the line on the bottom of the pool. It seems impossible at first, but it does get easier! Fitness-training version You can also use a version of this drill as part of your fitness training. Instead of just one stroke each, front–back–front, do two strokes on your front, then three on your back. Keep this rhythm all the way down the length, do a length of straight freestyle to recover, then repeat.

Doing this will almost always cost you in the end. You can have the highest possible degree of fitness, but if your technique causes drag, that fitness won’t do you much good. Even in the midst of training hard, put aside time for technique. You’ll get more from this if you can fit in separate technique-work sessions, but few of us have unlimited time. If you’re going through a period when all your pool time is needed for fitness swimming, fitting the next exercises into the start of a training session can be a useful sharpener for your stroke. One-arm swimming This drill is good for establishing arm rhythm and breath timing, as well as overall technique. At first you may find it easier with swim fins and/or a pull buoy, though these are really a bit of a crutch – as your leg kick improves, try to set them aside. --- Page 130 Text --- What you need: • Possibly swim fins and a pull buoy (worn together these help you keep a nice, flat body position: the buoyancy of the fins keeps your feet up even if you don’t kick) 1.

Focus on making sure you have good body roll, and breathe on your pulling-arm side. Breathe as infrequently as possible, but don’t let the drill become an aerobic challenge: you need to be swimming within yourself, rather than gasping for air. You can swim a whole length using just one arm, or take a certain number of breaths before changing sides. I prefer to change sides every four to six strokes, as it feels more balanced, but experiment to find the pattern that works best for you. --- Page 131 Text --- This is a tough drill, and under stress this swimmer has lifted his head, compromising his streamlined position in the water. He is, though, showing a very nice high-elbow pull. Trailing-arm variation This harder variation of the one-arm drill works your technique in a different way. In this version you leave your non-pulling arm trailing at your side, rather than reaching out in front of you, and breathe on the non-pulling side. The focus is on what your pulling-arm side is doing as you roll away from it to take a breath, and on timing the breath.

long, flat, streamlined position. Butterfly drill I include this drill in almost every warm-up. It combines a freestyle arm stroke with a butterfly leg movement. The drill loosens up your torso, gives a really strong feeling for swimming on your side, and a feel for the rotation of your hips and kicking action as you breathe. 1. Push off the wall and take an arm stroke. Keep your other arm extended, and breathe on this first stroke, as you would coming to the surface after a turn. 2. After the recovery, stay rolled to the side and take a second arm stroke with the same arm. Use the forward movement of your arm as it enters the water and the turn of your head after the breath to create a butterfly motion of your body. Let this motion wave down your body, ending in a kick. 3. After two arm strokes on one side, repeat the pattern on the other side, pulling with the other arm, rolling your body in that direction and breathing on a new side. --- Page 133 Text --- SWIMMING BLIND You do need an empty lane to try this! But it’s a really good way to judge how straight and balanced your stroke is. Most of us are constantly making teeny little body adjustments to keep swimming in a straight line. These are based on visual inputs that you don’t consciously register. Take them away, and a truer idea of how balanced your technique is will emerge. I also find swimming blind is a useful way of concentrating on how your stroke feels. It’s amazing how much easier it is to sense the effectiveness of your arm pull, or the degree of water resistance you’re experiencing, with your eyes shut. Start by swimming along above

They immediately see where their stroke differs from a really expert swimmer’s. Filming swimming The ideal scenario is for a friend to film you swimming. This is likely to be impossible in a public pool, as they generally don’t allow cameras. If you can get access to a private pool, though, it’s worthwhile getting a friend with a video camera to shoot some footage. Warm up first, and do a bit of swimming before the camera rolls, so that your stroke is working as it would in normal circumstances. Filming swimmers can be tricky, as people are rightly sensitive to cameras in swimming pools. If you can get permission to film, though, the benefits of seeing yourself swim are tremendous. Use lights and shadows Sometimes pools with lights in the walls can give you a glimpse of your stroke. It’s a bit like trying to get a glimpse of yourself in a shop window while cycling past, but if you swim at night, the lights will probably cast a shadow that’s defined enough to give you some idea of how your stroke is looking. --- Page 135 Text --- Keys to success • Keep your head in a good, streamlined position, and roll your body with every arm stroke • Swim with your eyes closed every once in a while, to assess whether your stroke is balanced • Take opportunities to watch yourself swim, in order to spot glitches in your technique --- Page 136 Text --- TURNS turn verb twist, rotate, go round, roll, twirl, move to face a different direction, move around an axis They’re not actually part of swimming technique, of course, but lots of people want to learn tumble turns, because they’re a good way of improving the distance you can cover in a set time.

twist, rotate, go round, roll, twirl, move to face a different direction, move around an axis They’re not actually part of swimming technique, of course, but lots of people want to learn tumble turns, because they’re a good way of improving the distance you can cover in a set time. If you’re aiming to do a triathlon with a pool-based swimming leg, it’s also worth learning how to do faster touch turns – tumble turns aren’t allowed in some triathlons. WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR The three key elements of a tumble turn are a fast tumble or flip, timing, and a --- Page 137 Text --- strong, streamlined push off the wall. • For a fast tumble or flip, you need to initiate the turn in a snappy way, and bend your body into as compact a shape as possible • Timing your turn relies on a combination of your distance from the wall and the speed at which you’re approaching it • A strong, streamlined push off the wall allows you to travel further underwater in a streamlined position OPEN-WATER TURNS Most triathlons have an open-water swim leg, rather than a pool leg. The course is usually laid out around one or two buoys, which all the swimmers have to pass at least once to complete the distance. Most novice triathletes get badly snagged up at these see the open-water chapter, for Rounding a buoy on how to avoid that happening to you. A streamlined push off the wall The push-off: strong and streamlined 1. Hold on to the side of the pool, and bring your legs up so that your feet are against the wall about 60 cm below the surface. Have one foot above the other, with your shoulders similarly canted. 2. Let go with your hands

water going up your nose. Getting used to tumbling Lots of swimmers get disoriented about which way is up when they try to learn tumble turns. They quickly get a snortful of water up their nose, come up coughing and spluttering, and give up. The trick to learning a tumble turn is to break it down into stages. This drill is the first step: getting used to tumbling underwater. 1. Push off the wall, but instead of adopting a streamlined position, push off with both hands by your sides. 2. Before you lose too much momentum, tuck your chin into your chest and --- OCR from Page 139 Image 1 --- Jaki sy lil wt ae yay --- Page 140 Text --- start a forward-roll motion. Lead with your head, and aim for this to be a snappy and definite movement. 3. Let your body, then your legs, follow your head around. Make your body as compact as possible, so that you tumble over quickly, and bend your legs too. Only take a breath when you’ve come back to the surface facing the same way as you were moving. Arm stretch tumble This drill first adds an element of stretching your arm out in front of you to tumble over, then of swimming into the tumble. 1. Push off the wall as in the push-off drill, except with one arm extended in the streamlined position. Have the other arm against your side. 2. Before you lose momentum, perform the tumble. The movement is similar to the previous drill, but this time it’s your arm that drives it, rather than your head: begin an arm pull, but continue the motion underneath your body, as if reaching back toward the space between your knees. 3. Let your head follow, and then the

The movement is similar to the previous drill, but this time it’s your arm that drives it, rather than your head: begin an arm pull, but continue the motion underneath your body, as if reaching back toward the space between your knees. 3. Let your head follow, and then the rest of your body as in the previous drill. --- Page 141 Text --- As before, keep blowing a constant stream of bubbles from your nose: only stop and take a breath when your head comes to the surface. 4. Practise this drill with both right and left arm stretching forward: later on this will mean you can turn whether it’s your right or left arm that makes the last stroke of the length. Leading with your arm This drill simply adds together two skills you already have: swimming freestyle and tumbling. It also teaches you how the angle at which you drive the turn with your arm affects the angle at which you tumble. 1. Push off the side of the wall into the streamlined position, then start swimming. Take a breath as you come up to the surface, then two or three strokes. 2. As you finish an arm stroke, perform the tumble you learned in the previous drill. Practise this on each arm, left and right. 3. Now try varying the angle at which your hand initiates the tumble. Instead of reaching between your knees, see what happens if you reach outside your left knee or right knee. Note how this affects the angle at which your legs come over during the tumble. For example, reaching outside your left knee with your right hand will mean your legs tumble over to the right-hand side, rather than directly over the centre line of your body. --- Page 143

striking a balance between distance and speed. Never let yourself slow down underwater to such an extent that you’re gliding slower than you would be swimming. It’s important to get back to the surface while you’re still travelling at a good speed. Otherwise, your first few strokes will be spent wasting energy getting you back up to swimming speed. TOUCH TURNS Tumble turns are barred in some pool-based triathlons, making it a good idea for triathletes to work on fast touch turns. If you have a pool-based swim like this coming up, give up tumble turns entirely for a couple of weeks beforehand. Otherwise you’re almost certain to forget yourself in the excitement of the event, throw in an accidental tumble turn and get disqualified. Practise this technique using both left and right hand to touch the wall; that way, you won’t compromise your swimming by trying always to finish on the same hand. 1 One-handed touch You only need to touch the wall with one hand. The best way to finish is very like a tumble turn, but instead of leading the tumble with your hand you leave it extended to touch the wall. You need your hand either gripping a rail or the edge, if either is available, or flat on the wall of the pool. 2 Push back --- Page 148 Text --- Bringing your legs tightly in under your body, at the same time push away from the wall with your hand, dropping your opposite shoulder back, away from the wall. Your non-pushing hand stays under the surface. 3 Plant and drive You should now be sideways (looking left if you touched with your right hand, right if you touched with your left). As your feet plant on the wall, let the pushing hand drop through

very quickly. A quick Google search will tell you which companies make swimming wetsuits: among the main brands are 2XU, Aqua Sphere, Ironman, Orca and Speedo, but there are lots of others. Decide on your price point, and try on as many as you can. It’s really worth visiting a shop: there’s no substitute for seeing how the suit actually fits your body shape. It needs to be as tight as possible but not constrictively short or draggily long. Getting out of your wetsuit In a triathlon, you have plenty of time to get into your wetsuit, but you’ll want to get out of it as fast as possible in order to start the bike leg. The only way to get good at this is to practise, at the end of open-water training sessions. --- Page 155 Text --- 1. As soon as you emerge from the water, start running toward your bike. Reach behind and grab the puller ribbon on your wetsuit. 2. With the other hand, undo the Velcro tab that holds most wetsuits closed. Next pull down the zipper. 3. Peel off first one arm, then the other. Then peel the suit down to your waist. The wetsuit will be half inside-out at this point. --- Page 156 Text --- 4. When you reach your bike, bend over and peel down/step out of the wetsuit legs. TECHNIQUE: ARM STROKE The arm stroke for open-water front crawl is essentially the same as for pool swimming. As in the pool, a smoother, more efficient stroke uses less energy for the same speed. This is probably even more important in open water: events are over longer distances, so the effect of tiny inefficiencies is magnified. One difference from the pool is in stroke rate: open-water swimmers generally swim with a

pool, a smoother, more efficient stroke uses less energy for the same speed. This is probably even more important in open water: events are over longer distances, so the effect of tiny inefficiencies is magnified. One difference from the pool is in stroke rate: open-water swimmers generally swim with a higher arm cadence than pool swimmers, of between 73 and 85 strokes per minute. ADAPTING TO CONDITIONS Open water swimming sometimes – nearly always, in fact – forces you to adapt your technique to the conditions. The key change is that if the water is choppy, a higher recovery of the forearm and hand is needed. This avoids your hand or arm being caught in the chop or wave face. You may also have to adapt your breathing pattern: if waves are coming from the left, breathe to the right, and vice versa. That way you’re less likely to swallow what feels like a small bucketful of water with each stroke. --- Page 157 Text --- Body-rotation mixed drill Good body rotation is as important in open-water swimming as it is in the pool. This mixed drill is hard work when done without fins, so it’s best to start with them on until you’re comfortable with the drill. What you need • Swim fins • Pull buoy 1. Push off in a streamlined position, but with your arms by your sides instead of stretched out ahead. Kick with a steady rhythm. 2. Keep looking downwards, not forwards. Take breaths on alternate sides, simply by rolling your body. Don’t move your arms or turn your neck to breathe, just roll your body. 3. After one length, take off your fins and put your pull buoy between your ankles (not your thighs as usual) or calves. Swim two lengths like this, concentrating

alternate sides, simply by rolling your body. Don’t move your arms or turn your neck to breathe, just roll your body. 3. After one length, take off your fins and put your pull buoy between your ankles (not your thighs as usual) or calves. Swim two lengths like this, concentrating on rolling your body with each stroke. 4. Take a 10-or 15-second rest, and repeat until you have done 15 lengths in total. --- Page 159 Text --- Fins off and pull buoy between ankles Top tip USE YOUR KICK FOR BALANCE, NOT SPEED In open-water events, which tend to be over longer distances, your kick’s key job is to maintain your body position and balance your arm stroke, not to provide forward movement. Aim to make small, neat kicks. If your feet sometimes cross, pointing your toes will help prevent this. TECHNIQUE: LEG KICK The leg kick for open-water is the same as for pool swimming, a flutter kick. There’s no need to make big changes, though a kick with low amplitude (the distance your feet move from top to bottom) creates less drag. --- Page 160 Text --- KICKING RHYTHM If you normally use a four-or six-beat kick, you may want to adjust your kicking rhythm. Kicking your legs isn’t a very energy-efficient way to get propulsion, and over the long distances of open-water events a high kicking cadence is very draining. If you’re about to climb on to a bike and ride 40km, then run 10km, this is a particularly bad idea. As a result, endurance swimmers and triathletes rely less on their legs than pool swimmers, except at the start or finish. They mostly use a two-beat kick, and gain less than 5 per cent of their propulsion from their legs. As a comparison, pool swimmers

touching their feet. 2. After a set distance or time, the leader pulls off the front. In a pool, it’s best just to stop after, say, 100m and let everyone else go by; in open water, the leader can just drift back after a minute on the front, then tag on to the back of the line. (If you’ve got a kayaker or someone who can blow a whistle at one-minute intervals, it makes this a lot easier.) 3. The new leader swims the same distance, before rotating back and allowing the swimmer behind to come through. All the swimmers need to have similar abilities, but you can make adjustments to fit quite a wide range. If stronger swimmers take longer pulls on the front, and weaker swimmers either take shorter turns or miss them, a fairly mixed group can train together. --- Page 168 Text --- Top tip ONCE IN A WHILE, DO A FARTLEK SESSION IN THE POOL Fartlek is really a run-training style, which is designed to improve both aerobic and anaerobic performance. The basic idea is that you’re continuously moving, but varying your pace. In a pool, you can do this by swimming between the backstroke flags, rather than to the end of the pool, then turning without touching the bottom or sides. Vary your pace: a few full-out sprints, some relaxed swimming and some race-pace all jumbled together. This swimmer is doing a tumble turn short of the edge of the pool, so that she won’t be able to push off. Starting to swim from a motionless beginning places much greater demands on your fitness and technique than an ordinary turn. Putting a few short turns like this into your training is a good way to vary your sessions. Open-water acclimatisation Although you can train

won’t be able to push off. Starting to swim from a motionless beginning places much greater demands on your fitness and technique than an ordinary turn. Putting a few short turns like this into your training is a good way to vary your sessions. Open-water acclimatisation Although you can train for an open-water swim in the pool, try to include at least a few open-water swims in the lead-up to your event. Not only that, also try to make sure the open water you train in is similar to event conditions. For example, there are fewer benefits to training in a river or lake if your event’s going to be in the ocean. Key things to bear in mind include: 1 Water temperature: Some open-water events do not allow wetsuits, even --- Page 169 Text --- though they take place in relatively cold water. The Channel swim is one example, but there are plenty of other, shorter ones. Cold water is particularly tricky to get used to, and the process can take months of acclimatisation. At the start, you may only be able to manage a minute in the water. The only consolation is that your body does adapt, and it does get easier. Warmer water than you’re used to also poses problems, but adaptation is less painful! You can mimic the effects of warm water by pool swimming in a wetsuit. 2 Water conditions: The open-water racing at the 2007 World Aquatics Championships in Melbourne was an event for the tough nuts, among the tough world of open-water racing. The competitors had to swim through large blooms of jellyfish, and some of the favourites failed even to finish. It’s an extreme example, but it does show that open-water swimmers need to be ready to face unexpected challenges, including waves,

without losing speed, can gain you several metres. Of course, that means the area close to the turn buoy becomes a pinch point: if you’re not competing, and want only to enjoy your swim, you may think it’s a better idea to give the buoy a wider berth. Rounding a buoy This is a good exercise for competitive open-water swimmers. It gets you corkscrewing round a turn buoy very quickly. You will need • Ideally, an anchored buoy 1. Swim at the buoy, sighting a couple of times as you get close to it. --- Page 171 Text --- 2. Aim to swim very slightly past the buoy, taking a stroke with the arm closest to the buoy (your left) as you come past. 3. Instead of taking another front crawl stroke, continue the roll of your body so that you turn on to your back. As you do this, twist slightly toward the buoy. 4. Take a stroke of backstroke with your other arm. Use this to continue to roll in the same direction, taking you back on to your front. With practice, this will get you round a 90° turn very fast, without the need to lift your head, do a little bit of breaststroke, etc. --- Page 172 Text --- SWIM STRATEGY FOR TRIATHLON If you are swimming open water as part of a triathlon, it’s worth thinking about how your swim will fit with your overall performance. Bear in mind that triathlons are never won on the swim leg. To get a good overall performance you’ll need to balance two key elements: finishing position versus energy expended. Unless you’re a very strong swimmer, pushing yourself to keep up with a fast group will leave you too tired for the bike and run legs. In general, it’s

the swim leg. To get a good overall performance you’ll need to balance two key elements: finishing position versus energy expended. Unless you’re a very strong swimmer, pushing yourself to keep up with a fast group will leave you too tired for the bike and run legs. In general, it’s better to finish the swim feeling somewhat within yourself, rather than as if you’re about to throw up through the effort. (Save that sensation for the run.) --- Page 173 Text --- Practising in open water will give you a clear idea of your maximum sustainable pace. Try to fix the rhythm of your stroke in your head. It’s possible to buy aids to help with this, including head attachments that tap out a preset rhythm, and watches that count the number of strokes you take each length. Navigation practice Navigation is a combination of efficient sighting and swimming straight toward a buoy or finish. Swimming straight for 25m, then efficiently sighting, will make any open-water swim easier. It does take practice, though! You will need • A small cone • A coach or helper 1. Position your coach or helper, armed with the cone, at the opposite end of the pool. (This exercise requires a pool that’s pretty much empty, or it can be done 20m or so out from the bank of a river, lake, etc.) 2. Push off the wall and start swimming. While you are underwater, your assistant will be putting the cone down somewhere along the far edge of the pool. 3. As you come to the surface, take a stroke or two and then sight as in the --- Page 174 Text --- head position drill, looking for the cone. 4. Swim to the cone without sighting again, aiming to finish your length as

Keys to success • Keep your stroke smooth • Maintain a streamlined head and body position • Adapt breathing patterns and arm recovery to the conditions • Prepare by swimming in open water, as well as the pool --- Page 176 Text --- TECHNIQUE TRAINING SESSIONS If you want your swimming to improve, you really have to work constantly on your technique. This is particularly true if you’ve introduced a new element to your stroke – the high-elbow pulling action, for example. If you’ve been swimming in a particular style for years, it will take a long time for a new style to become automatic. Until then, you’ll need to keep reminding yourself at regular intervals. WHEN TO WORK ON TECHNIQUE You’re not likely to achieve much if you only ever work on your technique after a hard training session, when you’re tired. It’s easy to slip into thinking you should be training hard, getting fitter, getting stronger, but none of these will bring you as much benefit as improving your technique. It’s best to devote a whole swim purely to technique work: your body and mind are fresh, and you concentrate harder, getting maximum benefit from your time in the water. Alternatively, if your time in the pool is severely squeezed, you could make technique work part of your warm-up, or spend the first part of the session doing drills, before getting into the fitness part of the session.

There’s an old saying that applies here: ‘First, do it. Then, do it right. Last, do it fast.’ Technique work falls into the second category: do it right. If you try to add speed, it will detract from your ability to control your movements with precision. Top tip --- Page 177 Text --- For most people, it’s worthwhile getting an experienced coach to provide an analysis of your style, and give you key areas for improvement.

Today he combines a career as a writer with coaching swimmers and running the successful Swim Better Fast technique clinics. He is also a keen surfer, cyclist and snowboarder. Paul’s talents as a swimmer first became evident – though probably only to his Dad – when he placed 16th in the national age-group championships at the tender age of 11. A couple of years of hard training later, he won his first international race at a Home Nations competition in Scotland. At 13 Paul broke into the national junior team after winning a silver medal at the national championships, and he went on to race internationally for two seasons.

At 13 Paul broke into the national junior team after winning a silver medal at the national championships, and he went on to race internationally for two seasons. He also captured the national short-course 100m and 200m records. Paul then retired from swimming, in search of a girlfriend who didn’t always smell of chlorine. In his mid-twenties Paul found his way back into swimming, racing at masters level and working with other swimmers to help them to improve their technique. Gradually he began to realise the lack of help available for older swimmers who wanted to get better, and were fit enough to do so, but were being held back by their technique. All Paul’s coaching is based on a simple principle: drag is your enemy. The Swim Better, Swim Faster approach has proved extremely popular with triathletes and keen leisure swimmers alike, as these happy former students will tell you: --- Page 188 Text --- ‘It’s like a new beginning. I felt before that I needed to get fitter and stronger to improve my swimming. Now I know the truth.’ ‘It all now seems less complicated than I’ve been making it.’ ‘I normally dread our swimming sessions, but this showed us how to use our training to better effect, rather than just slogging up and down the pool.’ ‘I improved my open-water swim time by 12 per cent.’ ‘One of the poolside lifeguards has just told me how well I’m swimming compared to when he’d last seen me.

As the National Governing Body for the development of triathlon coaching and coaches in Great Britain, our mission is focused on developing a world-leading triathlon coaching system, and indeed world class coaches to support the development of triathletes at all levels, from grassroots to high performance. As part of a recent review of our coach education system, and supporting learning resources, we identified the need to bring in respected specialists in a variety of areas to help us provide the most up-to-date innovative thinking. Swim Smooth was identified to support us on the swim coaching aspect of our education programmes. We didn’t just want a swim expert per se, we needed a company that understood triathlon swimming and, crucially, how to coach it in a real context. Swim Smooth has built an impressive international reputation and it is exciting that we can now utilise their experience and skills as part of our coaching programme. Swim Smooth will

per se, we needed a company that understood triathlon swimming and, crucially, how to coach it in a real context. Swim Smooth has built an impressive international reputation and it is exciting that we can now utilise their experience and skills as part of our coaching programme. Swim Smooth will add significant value to our coaching delivery as the demand for coaches in the fast growing modern Olympic sport of triathlon continues to grow year on year. Feedback from the coaches has always mentioned how the Swim Smooth section has improved their swim coaching. New and developing coaches have engaged with Swim Smooth coaching methods and new drills. One of Swim Smooth’s introductory breathing drills – ’breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe’ – is an excellent example of a simple but highly effective drill any coach can use to make an immediate improvement with any level of athlete. Swim Smooth’s methodical step-by-step approach to swim coaching helps remove the clutter which many swimmers report they feel when trying to improve their technique. We look forward to a long and successful partnership with Swim Smooth, and seeing the benefits and added value for our coaches, athletes and the wider sport. —Paul Moss, Coaching Development Manager, British Triathlon —Giles O’Brien, Coach Education Officer, British Triathlon --- Page 9 Text --- Preface The 11-Year-Old Girl You are in the pool one day, enjoying being in the water and working on your freestyle swimming. You are pretty happy with the progress you have been making and swimming is definitely becoming easier and a little quicker too – which is really satisfying. You set off for a few more laps and then suddenly in the next lane over a young girl jumps in the water, probably about 11 years old, and comes flying past you like you are barely moving.

becoming easier and a little quicker too – which is really satisfying. You set off for a few more laps and then suddenly in the next lane over a young girl jumps in the water, probably about 11 years old, and comes flying past you like you are barely moving. Before you know it she has executed a perfect tumble turn and comes back past you the other way, a near blur of fast moving, perfectly synchronised arms and legs. If you are an adult who has been swimming for a little while you have almost certainly had a similar experience to this. It can be quite a shock and even disheartening. ‘How can she do that? She is just a kid!’. Don’t worry, everyone has been passed by a much faster swimmer at some point in their lives and made to feel a little inadequate. Kids are not as physically strong as adults and don’t have the option of muscling their way through the water; instead they must use a good stroke technique – and high levels of aerobic fitness – to propel themselves quickly forwards. The fact that someone so small with very little strength can swim so quickly shows you what amazing potential each of us has in the water if we too can develop these areas of our swimming. Try not to be disheartened by the speed of fast swimmers but instead see them as an inspiration: how a child can swim so well and be so comfortable in the water is an amazing thing and there are many lessons the aspiring adult swimmer can learn from them. This book is devoted to anyone looking to improve their freestyle swimming. You might be very new to swimming and are trying to become more comfortable in the

so comfortable in the water is an amazing thing and there are many lessons the aspiring adult swimmer can learn from them. This book is devoted to anyone looking to improve their freestyle swimming. You might be very new to swimming and are trying to become more comfortable in the water. Or perhaps you are a triathlete or open water swimmer looking to improve your speed and efficiency and move up through the field. Or you might be a top-age group or elite swimmer searching for a cutting edge in your races. Whatever your level, we have worked with hundreds of swimmers just like you, both in our coaching base in Perth, Australia and on our international clinic tours. We have developed and improved each and every one of those swimmers and as you will discover in this book, we know how to improve your individual swimming too. A big hello from one of the Swim Smooth Squads in Perth! --- Page 10 Text --- Before we get started on that, let’s take a quick look at the background behind Swim Smooth and how our coaching system came into existence. We Live Swimming Swim Smooth are based in Perth, Western Australia, and if you’ve ever been here you’ll understand why! We are very lucky to have fantastic outdoor pools, a beautiful ocean and a warm sunny climate to train in. We run coached swim sessions for adult swimmers like you every day, with around 300 swimmers choosing from 15 weekly sessions. Whatever your current ability level you would fit in nicely if you were here! We have beginners starting out who struggle to swim a lap at the moment, intermediate triathletes looking to improve their performances, age-group swimmers challenging themselves with swims of 20 km or more and elite triathletes

sessions. Whatever your current ability level you would fit in nicely if you were here! We have beginners starting out who struggle to swim a lap at the moment, intermediate triathletes looking to improve their performances, age-group swimmers challenging themselves with swims of 20 km or more and elite triathletes and swimmers dominating their races. We are very proud of our ability to coach and develop this huge range of swimmers. Alongside these squads we use advanced video analysis above and below the water to help swimmers understand what is holding them back in their strokes and exactly how to improve their speed and efficiency. We have been at the forefront of this technology for the last twelve years and have conducted thousands of analysis sessions in that time – in fact many of the photos in this book are taken from these video analysis and stroke correction sessions. In Chapter 16 we will show you how to run your own video analysis session at your pool using your own camera in movie-mode. This will give you such a powerful insight into your swimming that we strongly recommend you film yourself if at all possible. Developing coaches outside of Swim Smooth is also a real passion of ours and we regularly travel to North America and Europe to run advanced level training courses for swimming coaches to further their skills. In 2010 we were appointed by the British Triathlon as coaching consultants for swimming and have re-written the syllabus and training courses for their Coach Education system based on our methods. --- Page 11 Text --- Paul and Adam.

training courses for their Coach Education system based on our methods. --- Page 11 Text --- Paul and Adam. We run year-round open water skills sessions (great fun and our favourite sessions of the week) and regularly consult with elite triathletes and open water swimmers from around the world looking to improve their swimming. If that wasn’t enough to keep us busy, all of the Swim Smooth coaches are competitive swimmers or triathletes themselves and have been racing for many years. Working with so many swimmers in such an in-depth way has created an insightful, innovative and unique programme for you to enjoy whatever your level of swimming. No other group in the world has immersed itself in these experiences simultaneously for over ten years – we really do ‘live swimming’ – and don’t we know it when the alarm goes off at 4:15am every morning for squad training! Becoming 11 Again Before we get into all the details of stroke technique and how to train, let’s consider something possibly even more important: your mental approach to swimming. This might be a key advantage that our 11- year-old swimmer has over you: she swims without inhibition or self-imposed limitation. She doesn’t over-analyse, she’s not self- conscious and she doesn’t doubt herself. She looks forward to getting out of school, jumping in the water and having fun. Fun is a key part of the Swim Smooth philosophy because enjoyment really does have the power to make you a better swimmer. With enjoyment comes motivation and the desire to practice the right things on a consistent basis that will ultimately result in improved performance. If swimming is currently a bit of a frustrating experience for you, or even a ‘necessary evil’ for triathlon, then of course you need to improve your stroke

enjoyment comes motivation and the desire to practice the right things on a consistent basis that will ultimately result in improved performance. If swimming is currently a bit of a frustrating experience for you, or even a ‘necessary evil’ for triathlon, then of course you need to improve your stroke technique and possibly your fitness preparation too, which we will show you how to do in this book. But over and above that, a positive ‘care-free’ mental approach is so important, it could literally make the difference between you achieving your goals in the water or not. From time to time we will challenge you with coordinating an area of your stroke or perhaps undertaking a tough training set. We can’t promise you that it will always be easy but if you are ever tempted to think ‘I can’t!’ then take a leaf out of that 11-year- --- Page 12 Text --- old’s book: clear your mind and just go for it! You’ll soon be on the way to more comfortable, more efficient and faster swimming as a result. Who knows, you might even show some 11-year-olds a thing or two in the water! --- Page 13 Text --- Acknowledgements Paul Newsome Writing this book has been a dream come true and I guess my Grandma Rose was correct when she told me that one day I’d write a book. About what? I’m not sure she was able to predict given that she sadly passed away before I had even created Swim Smooth in 2004. Still, here we are, almost exactly seven years since we produced the very first Swim Smooth DVD and with a piece of work of which I am extremely proud. However, none of this work would have been possible without the help, guidance and inspiration of

to find a hub of swimming activity for all levels, ages and backgrounds far surpassing anywhere else in the world. With more 50m pools per head of population than anywhere else on the planet, and a multitude of fantastic open water swimming venues, I found myself immersed in a swimming Mecca with the demand for professional coaching enough to support a thriving full-time business. Over the years I --- Page 14 Text --- have been incredibly fortunate to work with such a massively diverse group of swimmers and triathletes. If it weren’t for them I would not have been able to formulate the ideas behind our unique Swim Types system. I owe thanks to each and every swimmer who I have ever coached in a 1-2-1, clinic or squad situation for allowing me to analyse their strokes and make sense of what efficiency means, not just scientifically, but on an applied basis in the real world. This book is also dedicated to you all in recognition of the need to sometimes go against convention and discover a more pragmatic way to coach a range of different swimmers. The mighty Challenge Stadium, Perth as seen in our DVDs. In the second book, Bounce by Matthew Syed, discussion is drawn to the fact that dedicated hard work rather than raw talent and chance encounters with the right people at the right time in your life helps nurture success and cultivate new ideas. Every coach that I have worked with as an athlete has always instilled this idea of hard work and dedication within me and fortunate liaisons, close friendships and training and racing experiences with some of the world’s best athletes have all helped form my coaching knowledge, persona and understanding of what it takes to achieve at a high level in

has always instilled this idea of hard work and dedication within me and fortunate liaisons, close friendships and training and racing experiences with some of the world’s best athletes have all helped form my coaching knowledge, persona and understanding of what it takes to achieve at a high level in both swimming and triathlon. To my coaches: Geoff Edmunds, Tony York, Mike Craven, Mrs Brown and Mrs Greenall who all played a role in getting me started in swimming at my first ever club in Bridlington, East Yorkshire; Eric Elbourne who first suggested to me at the age of ten that video analysis would be a good way to show me what I could be doing better in my own stroke, and Ben Pollard who showed me that swim coaching could be a professional pursuit at the Hull Olympic Club; Martin Mosey who encouraged me (at the time as a triathlete) to join his elite swim programme for solid early morning sessions, and to Maurice Pegg who showed so much passion and enthusiasm for swimming at the Borough of Kirklees Club; my running coach Brian Burgin at the Halifax Harriers who demonstrated how a no-nonsense mindset can drive an athlete far beyond his physical capabilities; David Lyles, Ian Turner and ‘Bernie’ at the University of Bath who again all encouraged me to swim within an elite programme witnessing first-hand how the best swimmers in the UK and Europe train even as a triathlete when many swim coaches might have scorned my triathlon interests; Richard --- OCR from Page 14 Image 1 --- Se --- Page 15 Text --- Hobson who gave such support during my university days and Robin Brew who showed me the technicalities of an efficient open water swimming stroke in a language that could be easily applied;

has never been for me as I have always preferred to have the freedom to do things my way and in a manner that I believe in–devoid of politics and committee decisions. With freedom, though, comes risk as a self-employed coach, and without doubt I have to credit this entrepreneurial spirit to both my dad, Shaun, and my step-dad, Stephen, who have both shown me the organisation, mindful planning, tenacity, will to succeed and, above all, a love for their craft, which has been so important in my development as an independent coach. My dad and my sister Sheryl’s love of graphics, animations, text / fonts and visually stimulating displays of colour and motion in their line of work has also arguably had a massive impact on my desire to make Swim Smooth a visually attractive learning tool. After all, if a picture paints a thousand words, imagine what an animation can do! Many things have led me to where I am at this point in my coaching career but none so interesting as how I came to meet my now business partner, Adam Young, on an internet site no less! Shortly after I released the original Swim Smooth website in December 2004, my attention was brought to a popular triathlon forum in the UK called TriTalk. People write in and discuss various matters pertaining to triathlon, with some of the more hotly ‘debated’ areas being that of correct swimming technique. Between 2005 and 2007 I had been a regular poster to the site under the ‘avatar’ of ‘Swim Smooth’, and aimed to help a wide range of swimmers and triathletes solve their swimming inefficiency woes. On the forum at the same time was someone going by the pseudonym ‘Younggun’ who posted some excellent advice about cycling and running. We

Thanks for making this Pom so welcome, extending your friendship, sharing many glasses of wine . . . oh, and the use of your spare rooms! Adam Young I would also like to thank Seth Godin for the huge difference he has made to my professional life and in many ways my personal life too.

You can read it from cover to cover or use it as an ongoing reference as your swimming improves and as you work on different areas of your stroke technique and preparation.

Smooth, we have tried to keep the technical jargon to a minimum and made our programme as easy to understand as possible, keeping things in a form you can easily apply to your stroke. The graphics and pictures have been selected to be engaging and insightful, and lead you through the topics as if we were coaching you face to face. If we start talking about ‘smiley faces painted on the palms of your hands’ or ‘kebab sticks running down the length of your spine’, we are doing so as a simple way of translating the complex biomechanics of an efficient freestyle stroke into something you can easily apply to your own swimming. In the book we make extensive use of such ‘visualisations’ to simplify areas of the freestyle stroke that many swimmers have historically found quite hard to interpret. Swim Smooth has a very visual coaching style and we know that our swimmers love this approach and find it a refreshing way to learn. Even if you are at an advanced level in your swimming, you will find our approach motivating and you will really benefit from decluttering some of the thought processes involved so that you can become more focused and take your swimming to the next level. From time to time we will recommend equipment and training aids that we find significantly benefit the swimmers and triathletes that we work with on a daily basis. We have been fortunate enough to have tried most of the swimming products on the market – some great and some not so great – and you can be assured that anything we feature gets our full seal of approval and is well worth considering for your own swimming – see Chapter 3. Please do not feel the need to rush out

products on the market – some great and some not so great – and you can be assured that anything we feature gets our full seal of approval and is well worth considering for your own swimming – see Chapter 3. Please do not feel the need to rush out and buy every product we mention; the tips and techniques in this book will give you significant grounds for improvement in their own right without the assistance of these additional tools. A Quick Overview Let’s run you through the structure of the book: --- Page 20 Text --- We kick off in Chapter 2 with an introduction to freestyle swimming and cover some of the terminology and conventions we use in this book. If you are new to swimming you will find this extremely useful and it will help you make sense of how swimmers and coaches talk about swimming. We then go on in Chapter 3 and take a look at some of the training equipment you might use and how to select the right tools to assist you in the best way possible. Next we will take a look at the Swim Smooth philosophy of ‘The Three Keys’, which are: 1) Stroke Technique; 2) Swim Specific Fitness Training; 3) Open Water Skills. These Three Keys form the outline structure of this book and as we will explain, working on all three elements of your preparation at the same time will give you the best improvements in your swimming. In fact if you have been swimming for a while and hit a speed and efficiency plateau it is likely you have the balance wrong between these three elements of your preparation. Stroke Technique (Key 1) takes a close look at each area of the freestyle stroke and how it

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
In fact if you have been swimming for a while and hit a speed and efficiency plateau it is likely you have the balance wrong between these three elements of your preparation. Stroke Technique (Key 1) takes a close look at each area of the freestyle stroke and how it should be performed. We will clear up a lot of misconceptions or things you might have read on the internet that date back 15 or 20 years or even earlier! Within this chapter we will show you how to improve each area of your stroke so that you become more comfortable in the water and become faster and more efficient at the same time. If you have primarily focused on reducing drag up until now you will find the section on developing your catch and propulsion particularly fascinating. Next we have a dedicated section on developing your stroke rate. This is an area that many intermediate swimmers struggle with and can be key to improving your stroke technique and performing well in open water. Even if you are a relative beginner, developing some rhythm in your stroke can be the key to improving your comfort levels and confidence swimming in the great outdoors. Then we move on to our fascinating Swim Types system – showing you the six classic ways in which people swim freestyle, including the distinct personality that each Swim Type tends to have. This is a great way to bring all the sections of the book together into a simple step-by-step process for you to follow (Appendix B) that is highly tailored to your individual needs. Before leaving Stroke Technique we will take you through a special feature showing you how to perform a video analysis on your own swimming and how to identify common flaws in

into a simple step-by-step process for you to follow (Appendix B) that is highly tailored to your individual needs. Before leaving Stroke Technique we will take you through a special feature showing you how to perform a video analysis on your own swimming and how to identify common flaws in your stroke. Referring you to the right section of this book we will highlight how to work on and fix those flaws, making your swimming more comfortable, more efficient and faster too. Very highly recommended! Swim Specific Fitness Training (Key 2) shows you how you should best train for distance swimming events such as open water swims and triathlon. Fitness from other sports rarely carries over very well to swimming, and developing your aerobic fitness in the water will make a huge difference to your comfort and speed in the water. It will also help you to sustain a better stroke technique as you swim and so improve your efficiency too. This section works in tandem with Appendix C, which contains hundreds of combinations of training sessions for you to follow. --- Page 21 Text --- To complete the section on training, we examine specific flexibility and conditioning work to improve your swimming posture and also avoid injury. The exercises in this section perfectly complement everything we cover in Keys 1–3 and will be essential if you suffer from any pain or injury during or after swimming. Open Water Skills (Key 3) explains how to prepare for open water swimming so as to have a confident, comfortable and fast race! Removing anxiety, drafting techniques, sighting and navigation are all included in detail. You can develop and practise these skills in the pool as well as the open water, in fact there are some advantages to doing so in the pool.

so as to have a confident, comfortable and fast race! Removing anxiety, drafting techniques, sighting and navigation are all included in detail. You can develop and practise these skills in the pool as well as the open water, in fact there are some advantages to doing so in the pool. Don’t leave this until near-race day, you should practise these skills year round, they are that important! Key 3: Open Water Skills should form a key part of your swimming preparation. Appendix A contains explanations and pictures of the Swim Smooth drills – showing you exactly how to perform them and which areas of the stroke they develop. You will find this very useful as an ongoing resource as you develop your swimming. Appendix B covers the stroke correction process for each of the Swim Types in turn. These consolidate all of the information from this book for you into a simple step by step process to follow for your individual Swim Type. Appendix C contains a library of training sessions for you to follow in the pool as recommended in Key 3. Need a technique session or want to train your aerobic system? No problem – there’s 5,100 possible combinations of sessions to follow so you will never get bored!

In relation to this book you will find the animations and video clips very insightful – in fact in some chapters we have given you links to the website to follow for just this reason. Mr Smooth and Miss Smooth Animations Available for free at our main website www.swimsmooth.com, our animated swimmers ‘Mr Smooth’ and ‘Miss Smooth’ show you two ideal freestyle strokes in action. They demonstrate one of the two ideal Swim Types each, the Smooth (Mr Smooth) and the refined-Swinger (Miss Smooth). These animations are extremely powerful visualisation tools and we highly recommend downloading the free application to your desktop so that you can view them from any angle or at any speed. For best effect, watch them just before you go for a swim and jump in the water and reproduce their strokes! Many swimmers have taken minutes off their times just by doing that. The Swim Types Website: www.swimtypes.com Our dedicated website explaining the Swim Type system is well worth viewing in relation to Chapters 17 to 23 of this book as it shows you video clips of each of the Swim Types in action. We hope you benefit from the Swim Type development processes in Appendix B; if you do, consider going on and purchasing the Swim Type Development Guide for your type. This is supplied as a PDF digital download to your computer and contains an even more detailed development process over and above that contained in this book. Our animated swimmer ‘Mr Smooth’ shows us the classic ‘Smooth’ stroke style in action. You can view him from any angle to gain great insight and understanding. --- Page 23 Text --- Swim

or suggest an idea you have that would help you and other swimmers. We get inspired by hearing your stories so please let us know! Coaching DVDs If you have enjoyed this book then an excellent accompaniment to it would be one of our coaching DVDs, which cover many of the drills and techniques here but in a visual format. In the DVDs we are able to show you great swimmers (including Olympic champions) in action, and visualising their strokes in the water can be hugely beneficial for your own stroke. At the time of writing we have three DVDs to offer you: 1. The Learn To Swim Programme is a fantastic way to learn freestyle from scratch with no prior swimming experience. We build up your stroke technique and confidence one step at a time, helping you adjust to having your face in the water, developing your breathing technique and constructing your stroke piece by piece. You will be amazed at how quickly you develop and you will soon be swimming your first laps of smooth relaxed freestyle – exhilarating! This DVD covers your first strokes in freestyle in much more depth than we have scope to do in this book. 2. Perfect for intermediate swimmers, The DVD Boxset is actually two DVDs and a CD ROM taking you through all aspects of stroke technique; all the drills you need to improve; open water swimming development and techniques, and a full 25- session training plan to follow in the pool. Featuring Olympic Gold Medallist Bill Kirby who has an extremely smooth stroke for you to watch and recreate yourself. 3.

The Catch Masterclass is our latest DVD and features amazing footage from our new ‘Hollywood style’ filming rig in Perth. Three top-flight swimmers show us the secrets of their catch technique in incredible detail as we explain exactly what they’re doing, how to improve your own catch technique and where you might have gone wrong in the past. Five star reviews aplenty! All these DVDs are available in our store at www.swimsmooth.com/products --- Page 25 Text --- CHAPTER 2 Introduction to Freestyle Swimming The Freestyle swim stroke, often called Front Crawl in many parts of the world, is the fastest of the four competitive strokes and also the one best suited to long distance events. In the elite swimming world it is the only stroke that is raced for distances of 400 m and longer. Freestyle is unique in that the swimmer has their face in the water for most of the stroke before rotating to the side to breathe very low to the surface. Breathing is a significant challenge when learning freestyle and the struggle to get enough air, without taking on water, is a dominant feature of many beginners’ experiences. Freestyle is the fastest of the four competition strokes. The body rotates along the long axis of the spine during the stroke, which helps the swimmer engage their chest, back and core muscles effectively on every stroke. The lack of vertical movement in comparison to butterfly or breaststroke allows good swimmers to sit very high in the water minimising their drag profile. In comparison to backstroke, freestyle has biomechanical advantages, allowing a better propulsive technique in the water. For triathlon and open water swimming, freestyle is a

The lack of vertical movement in comparison to butterfly or breaststroke allows good swimmers to sit very high in the water minimising their drag profile. In comparison to backstroke, freestyle has biomechanical advantages, allowing a better propulsive technique in the water. For triathlon and open water swimming, freestyle is a much more compact and ‘narrow’ stroke than butterfly and breaststroke making it ideal for swimming in close confines to other swimmers and obviously has significant sighting advantages for holding a straight line between points over swimming on your back in backstroke. --- Page 26 Text --- ADAM: If you can swim breaststroke comfortably but are new to freestyle you’ll find it a revelation when you get the hang of it. With practice you will be able to feel a real sense of rhythm in the stroke without the stop-go action of breaststroke. It’s a bit like breaking out into a run after walking. As we will see in this book, the exact freestyle technique used by great swimmers varies depending on the race distance, the race environment (e.g. pool vs. open water) and to some extent personal preference. However, the key elements of a great stroke are common between all these great swimmers. Swimming Terminology As coaches and swimmers we have names for each area of the stroke and conventions we use for elements like your swimming speed and the length of your stroke as you swim. Don’t be put off by this, this ‘jargon’ is pretty simple and makes a lot of sense when you get the hang of it. The good news is that, for the large part, the terminology used in this book is common all over the world which means you should be able to understand most things written on the internet about swimming and coaching

movement of the swimmer along the long axis of their spine as they swim, a little like being skewered on a kebab stick (as crude as that sounds!). This roll helps the swimmer generate more power, reduces drag and assists the arms in recovering over the surface. Find out how to develop good rotation in Chapter 11. ‘Body Position’ refers to how high a swimmer sits in the water, particularly the level of the hips and legs. A low-lying body position creates lots of drag as the frontal profile is much larger. You can find out more about this area of stroke technique in Chapter 8. ‘Bilateral Breathing’ refers to breathing to both sides when you swim, if not in turn then regularly swapping sides. ‘Unilateral Breathing’ means the swimmer only ever breathes to a preferred side, either the left or right. Swim Smooth strongly recommend the ability to be able to breathe equally well to both sides, for the benefits of doing so see Chapter 7 and Key 3: Open Water Adaptation. ‘The Bow Wave’ is the wave formed by your body as you pass through the water; it’s a term taken from boating where the wave shape is seen against a boat’s bow. The bow wave forms as your head passes through the water with a slight rise in the water’s surface in front of the head followed by a dip past the head and neck area, known as the ‘trough’. A good freestyle breathing technique takes advantage of the bow wave as the --- OCR from Page 28 Image 1 --- freestyle stroke terminology “body position” is the height of the swimmer’s body, hips, legs and feet in the water mn” or “bod I” is the rotation of the at side with every stroke --- Page 29

This is known as ‘Bow-Wave Breathing’. The bow wave is formed by the head and body passing through the water. ‘Feel For The Water’ is a term used to describe the sensation of the water on your hands and arms as you swim. When a swimmer is feeling the water well they are timing their stroke movements to create good propulsion resulting in a good feeling of connection with the water. We use drills and visualisations to help you develop this in your own stroke, see Chapter 13. ‘Stroke Length’ is a commonly discussed area of swimming as we shall see in this book. The normal way to measure it is to count how many strokes you take to swim a length of the pool counting both arms. A lower number indicates a longer stroke. When quoting this figure you should always mention the length of the pool too – e.g. 25 yd, 25 m, 33 m, 50 yd, 50 m. Typical stroke counts in a 25 m pool are between 11 and 30 strokes per length – which you will often see abbreviated to SPL. ‘Stroke Rate’ (not to be confused with stroke length) is how many strokes you take per minute, counting both arms. This is like cadence on a bicycle except with cadence you only count one leg, not both! The higher your stroke rate, the faster you are turning your

to SPL. ‘Stroke Rate’ (not to be confused with stroke length) is how many strokes you take per minute, counting both arms. This is like cadence on a bicycle except with cadence you only count one leg, not both! The higher your stroke rate, the faster you are turning your arms over. Typical numbers are in the range of 35 to 110 strokes per minute (SPM) with most non-elite swimmers in the 50–65 SPM range. Traditionally it was very difficult for swimmers to control their stroke rates but with the invention of stroke beepers such as the Wetronome and the Finis Tempo Trainer Pro (see Chapter 3) this has become much easier. These beepers can be set to a given number of strokes per minute and you simply coordinate your strokes to the beep as you swim – controlling your stroke rate in this manner can be extremely beneficial to your stroke technique as we shall see in Chapter 14. Unlike stroke length, stroke rate can be easily measured in open water and this makes it the key reference for open water swimmers to monitor their strokes. Generally speaking open water swimmers use higher stroke rates with a slightly shorter stroke length than pool swimmers. This helps them punch through waves, chop and the wake from other swimmers. As we will discuss in Chapters 14 and 39 this may be a worthwhile modification to make in your stroke in this environment. --- Page 30 Text --- Some references to stroke rate on the internet and in academic papers might refer to stroke cycles per minute – one cycle being the combination of a left and right arm stroke. In this situation 30 cycles per minute is equivalent to 60 strokes per minute. Some sources also refer to cycle time in

swimmers as they push off from the wall. This position has a very low level of drag, lower than when swimming normally. The quickest way to swim is to push off from the wall and hold this streamlined position until the speed drops to normal swimming speed and then ‘break-out’ into full stroke. The length of this push-off is normally around 5 m (15 feet) but some elite swimmers can hold the position up to the maximum FINA-legal limit of 15 m (45 feet) and accompany it with a powerful kick. See Chapters 9 and 10 for a discussion of the other benefits of using a good torpedo push-off when you swim. --- Page 31 Text --- A pace clock has two opposite second hands – with practice you can time yourself over any distance using it. In open water swimmers gain an advantage from swimming behind or to the side of other swimmers, a technique known as ‘drafting’. ‘Short Course’ and ‘Long Course’ pools are technical terms to describe 25 m and 50 m (or yards) pools respectively. The Olympic Games always uses a long course pool and generally they are slightly slower to swim in than a short course pool as the swimmer turns less often and so loses the speed benefit from a strong push-off from the wall. FINA world championships are swum in both long course and short course pools. Two separate sets of world records are kept for long and short course pools. The Wikipedia page at www.swimsmooth.com/worldrecords has a full and up-to-date listing of these complete records and makes for fascinating reading when comparing it to your own times! ‘Hypoxic Breathing’ is the process of swimming whilst limiting your supply of oxygen by breathing less frequently than normal, typically every five, seven or nine

page at www.swimsmooth.com/worldrecords has a full and up-to-date listing of these complete records and makes for fascinating reading when comparing it to your own times! ‘Hypoxic Breathing’ is the process of swimming whilst limiting your supply of oxygen by breathing less frequently than normal, typically every five, seven or nine strokes. Many coaches state that this helps to build lung capacity and aerobic endurance but definitive studies demonstrating this are lacking. At Swim Smooth we use sets of restricted breathing frequency to allow the swimmer to focus on a deeper exhalation in the water rather than holding your breath. When breathing less frequently you should aim to stay calm and to allow yourself time to focus on the symmetry of your stroke. ‘Drafting’ is the act of swimming behind or to the side of another swimmer to gain an advantage. This is perfectly legal in open water swimming and triathlon and viewed --- Page 32 Text --- as fair-play with swimmers looking to maximise the benefit they gain when racing. As we shall see in Chapter 36, there are two positions to draft in, either directly behind or to the side and slightly behind another swimmer. ‘Sighting’ is the act of raising the head above the water’s surface to look forward and navigate in open water whilst swimming. Lifting the head places downward pressure on the legs as the body pivots around its centre and this creates extra drag. As we shall see in Chapter 35, a good sighting technique minimises the head lift to minimise additional drag.

excellent clarity and anti- fog properties. We recommend that female swimmers with small faces try out junior size goggles for a better fit. Goggle clarity in the open water is essential and will make you feel much more comfortable in this environment. 3. Fins/Flippers – these are excellent tools to have in your swim kit bag as they help to develop good ankle flexibility and provide extra propulsion when performing technical drills. As long as fins are used correctly and with a purpose you should not consider them as ‘cheating’ but as an aid to assist you in your swim stroke development. Choose fins that are slightly longer than the shorter ‘zoomer’ style as they will be more comfortable and encourage a better kicking action for drill work. There are many training tools you can use to assist you with your swimming, some useful, some not so useful. For a review of each see the main text. Unfortunately due to health and safety regulations in some swimming pools (especially in the UK) fins are not allowed but it’s always worthwhile checking with your local pool to see if they will let you use them. Fins are so beneficial for helping you develop your stroke technique that if it were a choice between two pools with one allowing the use and the other not, always go to the one that does. If you’re not fortunate enough to have more than one pool in your local vicinity, --- Page 35 Text --- enquire with your pool as to whether they might allow fins in a session one night per week. 4.

enquire with your pool as to whether they might allow fins in a session one night per week. 4. Pull Buoys – for those with ‘Sinky Leg Syndrome’ pull buoys can become a bit of a crux and should not be used to simply mask a low body position or a scissor leg kick. It is generally less challenging aerobically to swim with a pull-buoy and this can lead to de-training if they are overused. On the flip side, they allow you to specifically focus your attention on the catch phase of the stroke. In our programmes we use pull buoys regularly during sculling drills to build up your ‘feel for the water’ but you should always remember to emphasise good rotation as everyone has a bit of a tendency to flatten off in their stroke when using one. A mid-length rubber fin (left) is much better for performing drills than a shorter zoomer-style fin (right) due to the extra propulsion and flexibility it offers. FIGURE 3.3 There is a huge variety of paddles on the market. Highly Recommended 5. Finis Freestyler Paddles – if you only purchase one pair of paddles, our recommendation is for the ‘Freestylers’ by Finis. These paddles work to improve your hand entry and alignment in the water and are designed to fall off your hand if used incorrectly giving you immediate feedback about your stroke. --- Page 36 Text --- Stroke rate and lap interval beepers by Wetronome and Finis sit under your swimming cap and beep to you a lap-pace or stroke rate as you swim. 6.

cap and beep to you a lap-pace or stroke rate as you swim. 6. Finis Tempo Trainer Pro and Wetronome – being able to accurately control your stroke rate in the pool and pace yourself well are two key swimming skills that do not come naturally to many swimmers. You programme these small ‘beepers’ and then put them under your swim cap when you swim; they then beep a target pace per 100 m to you (a beep for every time that you should be at each 25 m marker) or in stroke rate mode, a beep for every single stroke. This sounds very basic but the power of these devices cannot be over-estimated. Firstly, they help to motivate you through training sets and also let you focus on the swimming rather than watching the clock all the time. At the same time they develop your pacing skills, which is a huge advantage in races as nearly every swimmer starts too fast and then slows down – by pacing things correctly you will perform much better overall. In fact you may set some PBs the very first time you swim with one in lap- interval mode for just that reason! In stroke rate mode they give you subtle control over your swimming, allowing you to lift or lower your stroke rate to find the efficiency sweet spots in your stroke.

conventional paddles work on the assumption that if you create a larger surface area for the hand to work against it will help you develop a greater catch and feel for the water. However, overuse of large paddles with poor technique can be very troublesome for your shoulders. They might also slow your stroke rate down to an unrealistically low rate and with swimming being limited more by technique than brute strength, the notion that you need to become stronger to swim faster is normally misguided. PT and Palm Paddles work as a direct opposite to a normal paddle in that their convex shape removes the sensation of a good catch and thus encourages you to bend your elbow more under the water to gain a better catch with the forearm. When used for the first time they really feel like your hands are slipping through the water but that is --- Page 37 Text --- precisely the point – remove the paddle after 50 m to 100 m and your sense of ‘feel for the water’ is greatly heightened. 8. Other Conventional Paddles – there is a huge range of the more conventional style of paddle available on the market, with new designs being created all the time. Conventional paddles still have a place in the kit bag of more advanced swimmers with good stroke technique and certainly the smaller ‘finger paddles’ (not shown) are great for developing a better initial catch. Avoid overuse of any paddle and be wary of the desire to become stronger by using them – it’s usually the stronger athletes, who need a little more finesse in their stroke, who tend to reach for the big dinner-plate paddles before anyone else in the squad. 9. Finis Snorkel – snorkels are a good way of

and developed highly effective coaching methods for every type of swimmer. We also work and interact with hundreds of swimming coaches around the world both in person and through our Coaches Network on the internet. Through all of this coaching experience, one thing has proven to be true time and time again: the swimmers who make the biggest improvements follow a rounded programme covering three critical areas of swimming development: 1. They develop their stroke technique in the pool using drills and visualisations specific to their individual stroke needs. 2. They consistently train their swim specific fitness (with an emphasis on the consistency). 3. They regularly practise their open water skills such as drafting, sighting and rhythm, either in the pool or in open water. We call these areas The Three Keys and they are so fundamental to the Swim Smooth philosophy that we have structured this whole book around them: Key 1: Stroke Technique Development – Chapters 5 to 23 Key 2: Swim Training – Chapters 24 to 32 Key 3: Open Water Skills – Chapters 33 to 39 You may immediately appreciate why each of these keys are important to maximise your performance, however you may be tempted to focus on each one at different times of the year (in coaching jargon we call this ‘periodisation’). Do not make this mistake. Separating them out into different periods during the year becomes a lot less effective than working on them simultaneously all year round. Combining the Three Keys When we first explain to swimmers the concept of working on these three elements at the same time, they are sometimes concerned that this is a complex thing to do or that they might not have time in their swimming week.

we first explain to swimmers the concept of working on these three elements at the same time, they are sometimes concerned that this is a complex thing to do or that they might not have time in their swimming week. Actually, training in this way is not as complicated or difficult as you might imagine. Instead, the variety of challenges it --- Page 40 Text --- offers to your brain and body is great fun, really keeping you on your toes and pushing your swimming quickly forward at the same time. You will never get bored or stagnant again! PAUL: We very much follow this philosophy in the Swim Smooth squads in Perth, conducting technique, fitness and open water skills sessions (in the pool and open water) every week. Interestingly, one of the most popular sessions of the week are the harder CSS training sessions that we will explain to you in Chapter 27. We affectionately call them ‘Fresh and Fruity’ sessions, so called because of the higher intensity required in these sessions and as a way of making light of what are actually quite tough sessions. Despite Swim Smooth being renowned locally as a squad focused on developing a swimmer’s technical efficiency, these harder fitness sessions are very popular and give each swimmer a great sense of achievement afterwards. Many swimmers join our squads to improve their stroke technique and then really discover the fitness side of swimming too and benefit greatly from the training. They are not afraid of a little bit of hard work and as Captain Matthew Webb, the first man to swim the English Channel in 1875, famously said: ‘Nothing great is easy!’ To help you combine the three keys together in your training week we have developed special weekly ‘Skeleton Structures’ for you to

of a little bit of hard work and as Captain Matthew Webb, the first man to swim the English Channel in 1875, famously said: ‘Nothing great is easy!’ To help you combine the three keys together in your training week we have developed special weekly ‘Skeleton Structures’ for you to follow (Chapter 26) and also an extensive set of training sessions to slot into that structure (Appendix C). By following this training routine your swimming technique, efficiency, fitness and race skills will soon be moving forward apace. How the Three Keys Interact with Each Other One of the reasons why you need to work on all three of the keys at the same time is that the three areas interact and benefit each other – i.e. they add up to more than the sum of their individual parts. A good example of this is how fitness training benefits your stroke technique development. Many swimmers focus purely on their technique in the pool and avoid any training sets for fear they will harm their stroke technique – we affectionately call this group of swimmers ‘Technique Hermits’. Although these swimmers may make some initial progress with their swimming, they soon hit a plateau in performance beyond which they cannot progress. In fact some of these guys are so diligent that they have been repeating the same technique sessions for years with the hope that one day they will break through to better swimming. This is a great shame; such dedicated swimmers deserve much better. Professional triathlete and Ironman winner Scott Neyedli knows that it takes more than drills and a pretty stroke to allow him to swim 3.8 km in under 45 minutes. --- Page 41 Text --- Of course, the opposite is also true: many Masters swimmers focus purely on training

much better. Professional triathlete and Ironman winner Scott Neyedli knows that it takes more than drills and a pretty stroke to allow him to swim 3.8 km in under 45 minutes. --- Page 41 Text --- Of course, the opposite is also true: many Masters swimmers focus purely on training and never work on improving their stroke technique. Just as much as the Technique Hermits, this group stands to make some large improvements by following a more balanced approach to their swimming preparation from introducing structured and focused technique sessions. ADAM: If you have gone down the technique-only route yourself in the past don’t be concerned, by introducing the other two keys (training and open water skills) into your training week you will quickly start to make progress again. If you have held the belief that stroke technique is all important for a long time then it’s only natural to feel sceptical at first but judge the results objectively, are you swimming more quickly and more easily with a more balanced preparation? A second classic example of the interaction between the three keys is how open water skills benefit stroke technique development. If you exclusively focus on stroke technique, the tendency is to develop a long stroke at a slow stroke rate. You may make some progress in the pool by focusing on technique but when summer comes around and you swim in open water you would soon be left behind by swimmers with a slightly shorter faster stroke that is much more suited to this environment. By performing regular open water skills sessions (in the pool in winter) alongside your technique sessions, your stroke technique will naturally develop in the right direction to be efficient in the open water. If you are a triathlete this is especially vital for

is much more suited to this environment. By performing regular open water skills sessions (in the pool in winter) alongside your technique sessions, your stroke technique will naturally develop in the right direction to be efficient in the open water. If you are a triathlete this is especially vital for you. Taking Time Out of Your Swim Splits Another way to explain the importance of the three keys is to look at things in terms of time saving. Let’s say you were a triathlete preparing for Olympic Distance races where the swim leg is 1500 m in open water. At the moment you swim around thirty minutes for 1500 m and you set yourself a target of swimming six minutes quicker, what is the best way to go about making this improvement? Most triathletes in this situation would try to make this improvement by focusing purely on the efficiency of their stroke technique. Of course, this is a worthy goal but you would greatly increase your chances of success by splitting things out and looking to get two minutes each from your technique, fitness and open water skills instead. Or --- Page 42 Text --- looking at this another way, if you did improve your stroke efficiency to the tune of six minutes you would have left those fitness and open water improvements on the table and you could then be swimming much more quickly still.

As someone interested in improving your swimming you’ve probably watched Olympic swimmers on TV or on YouTube. If you have a good club at your local pool you might have seen some very good junior swimmers up close and if you’ve been to a large triathlon or open water event you’ve perhaps watched the elite wave of the race. Comparing all of these great swimmers, all with different builds and all racing in different environments, you will have noticed a large range of stroke styles: some have strong kicks, others nearly no kick, some a high elbow recovery, others a straight arm recovery, some with a short punchy style, others with a long flowing stroke. Yet all of them are swimming extremely quickly. The stroke styles of elite swimmers can look quite different but there are common elements of great stroke technique between them all. Whilst you might never swim quite as quickly as an Olympic champion, just like them you should look to develop your own stroke technique into one that suits your body type and the environment in which you are racing. Whatever your chosen style, you should share the common elements of good technique with those of the elite swimmers so that you can have low levels of drag and high levels of propulsion in your own stroke. ADAM: Developing a good freestyle stroke technique is essential to swim well in the pool and open water alike.

share the common elements of good technique with those of the elite swimmers so that you can have low levels of drag and high levels of propulsion in your own stroke. ADAM: Developing a good freestyle stroke technique is essential to swim well in the pool and open water alike. A good stroke technique reduces your drag and increases your propulsion for a given level of effort, meaning you move more quickly or more easily through the water – or both! TABLE 5.1 Olympic champions in numbers. Note the range of stroke rates, speeds and recovery styles of all these great swimmers.

We will clear up a few common misconceptions along the way and refer to Appendix A, which contains descriptions of the key drills and visualisations targeting different areas of your stroke technique. These drills are the standard set that we’ve developed and refined with our large training squads in Perth, Western Australia and also around the world with our popular Swim Smooth Clinic series. They are designed to be used by all levels of swimmer from beginner to elite swimmer – you’ll find them very useful to improve your own swimming. In Chapter 15 we will take a more in-depth scientific look at swimming efficiency, giving a lot of background on the coaching advice we offer to swimmers. If you are technically minded you will find this a very interesting section of the book as we put some classic misconceptions about stroke efficiency to bed. Later in Chapter 17 we’ll take a look at our innovative Swim Types system, which examines the six distinct styles that people use to swim freestyle. When you identify your own Swim Type then we will be able to give you some very specific advice to improve your stroke, referring back to the individual methods in Chapters 7–14 as we do so. This is an extremely powerful way to identify flaws in your stroke if you are not fortunate enough to have a coach watching over you when you swim. --- Page 46 Text --- CHAPTER 6 Stroke Flaws – Cause and Effect A Never-Ending Pursuit Working on your stroke technique is not just something for swimmers

way to identify flaws in your stroke if you are not fortunate enough to have a coach watching over you when you swim. --- Page 46 Text --- CHAPTER 6 Stroke Flaws – Cause and Effect A Never-Ending Pursuit Working on your stroke technique is not just something for swimmers new to freestyle; every swimmer of any ability level should regularly work on their stroke – it’s a never- ending pursuit. Nearly all swimmers, even those who are swimming very well, have areas of their technique they could improve on significantly which would make their stroke more efficient, relaxed, faster or offer better endurance. Even an Olympic champion with a fantastic stroke will still spend a significant portion of their weekly training maintaining and reinforcing their technique; without doing so their performances could easily drop off. Working on your stroke technique does not sound very exciting but it can actually be a lot of fun: it brings variety to your swim training and gives you a different sort of challenge to that offered by fitness training. We will use the Swim Smooth drill set (Appendix A) to assist you in this task; each drill or visualisation is a highly developed tool to help you work on the weaker areas in your stroke technique. Cause and Effect Before we start looking at each area of the freestyle stroke, it is important to remember that when you jump in the water to correct your stroke you need to keep things simple at all times. To help you do this, Swim Smooth uses a simple but deceptively powerful coaching philosophy called ‘Cause and Effect’. Cause and Effect says that for every stroke flaw (the effect) there is an underlying cause for it. This is powerful because it helps you get to the root

all times. To help you do this, Swim Smooth uses a simple but deceptively powerful coaching philosophy called ‘Cause and Effect’. Cause and Effect says that for every stroke flaw (the effect) there is an underlying cause for it. This is powerful because it helps you get to the root cause of stroke flaws and fix them for good. For instance, a scissor kick where the legs part excessively creating a lot of drag is triggered by a loss of balance from crossing the centre line with the lead hand in front of the head (the cause). By removing the crossover you will fix the scissor kick, without ever thinking about your kick itself. The conventional approach to fixing a scissor kick is lots of kicking technique work and focus on keeping the legs together but ultimately the scissor kick will keep returning as the underlying cause has not been removed. Note that ‘Cause and Effect’ also reduces the number of problems that you have to fix in your stroke. You could look at a swimmer and say that they hold their breath underwater and that they have a poor body position with low legs. This is not really two --- Page 47 Text --- problems though, it is just one: by improving their exhalation the swimmer will reduce the excess buoyancy in their chest and help bring the legs up high. We are sure you are beginning to see the power of this methodology, especially if you have felt a little ‘cluttered’ in the past by trying to correct multiple aspects of your stroke at the same time. As we look at each area of freestyle stroke technique in turn we will take a look at the cause of every stroke flaw and provide you with drills and visualisations

a little ‘cluttered’ in the past by trying to correct multiple aspects of your stroke at the same time. As we look at each area of freestyle stroke technique in turn we will take a look at the cause of every stroke flaw and provide you with drills and visualisations to remove that underlying cause. OK, let’s get to work! --- Page 48 Text --- CHAPTER 7 Breathing It would not be an overstatement to say that breathing technique is the single most important aspect of freestyle swimming. Good breathing technique is much more challenging in freestyle than the other strokes because the head is in the water at all times and the swimmer must keep their head low and breathe out to the side very near the surface. For swimmers learning freestyle, breathing can be extremely challenging and it’s normal to experience high levels of anxiety about getting enough air and not swallowing water! If you feel this way then developing your exhalation into the water and your bow-wave breathing technique is going to be critical to improving your swimming; these are the first two aspects of breathing technique we’ll look at here. Don’t worry, work on the technique of breathing and you’ll soon be feeling much more calm and relaxed when swimming freestyle. Holding your breath underwater will cause a build-up of CO in your lungs and 2 blood stream and make your swimming feel tense. For intermediate level swimmers, brushing up on bow-wave breathing and exhalation into the water is going to be useful for you and will make a real difference to your efficiency and level of relaxation. We also strongly encourage you to learn to breathe bilaterally, which is important as a natural way of keeping your stroke symmetrical and can even help you develop

the water is going to be useful for you and will make a real difference to your efficiency and level of relaxation. We also strongly encourage you to learn to breathe bilaterally, which is important as a natural way of keeping your stroke symmetrical and can even help you develop the catch phase of your stroke. Don’t worry if you’ve tried bilateral breathing before and struggled, we’ll show you why that was and how to conquer it. Breathing timing, specifically breathing late, can also be a problem for more advanced swimmers. We’ll look at breathing timing in the final part of this section. --- Page 49 Text --- Exhalation For all swimmers it’s important to constantly exhale whenever you are face down in the water. This rids your lungs and bloodstream of CO and means that when you do rotate 2 to breathe you have more time to inhale as you don’t have to exhale first. It also helps to improve your body position as too much buoyancy in the chest lifts your front end up and puts downward pressure on the legs. PAUL: If you’ve ever done any yoga you’ll intuitively understand the relationship between breathing technique and relaxation. If you hold your breath you automatically become tense – please never never do this when swimming! Instead focus on exhaling into the water with a long constant stream of bubbles. I ask swimmers I’m coaching to experiment with making sounds into the water as they exhale, for example the ‘brrrrrr’ sound of a motorboat or motorbike. As simplistic as this sounds it can really make a huge difference to your swimming. Exhaling into the water sounds easy but can be surprisingly hard to learn. For many swimmers it simply doesn’t feel like a natural thing to do. To develop

‘brrrrrr’ sound of a motorboat or motorbike. As simplistic as this sounds it can really make a huge difference to your swimming. Exhaling into the water sounds easy but can be surprisingly hard to learn. For many swimmers it simply doesn’t feel like a natural thing to do. To develop good exhalation technique use the Sink Down Exercise in Appendix A. Experiment between exhaling into the water using either your mouth or nose or a mix of both; there’s no right or wrong here, see which feels more natural for you and then stick with that method. It should feel like you are sighing and not forcing the air out. Try to be loose and floppy as you sink down to remove all the tension from your body. Your ability to sink to the bottom of the pool during the Sink Down Exercise is totally determined by how relaxed and efficient your exhalation is into the water. Many swimmers with poor body positions would expect to sink like a stone but often the opposite is true and they find it harder to sink than other swimmers. This is an interesting insight into their swimming as it shows how their tendency to hold onto their breath is actually harming their body position: the excess buoyancy in the chest lifts their front end up but the body then pivots around its centre and so pushes the legs downward. Once you are able to sink down easily to the bottom of the pool with a nice relaxed exhalation try some easy laps of freestyle swimming. Simply focus on a smooth exhalation into the water using your normal breathing pattern to whichever side you feel most comfortable. For those who normally only breathe to one side, don’t be surprised if you notice that you

with a nice relaxed exhalation try some easy laps of freestyle swimming. Simply focus on a smooth exhalation into the water using your normal breathing pattern to whichever side you feel most comfortable. For those who normally only breathe to one side, don’t be surprised if you notice that you are suddenly able to go from breathing every two strokes to breathing every four strokes and feel more comfortable doing so. Sometimes breathing every two strokes does not physically give you enough time to exhale properly especially if you have a naturally high stroke rate. Develop your relaxation in the water using the Sink Down Exercise at the beginning of your training sessions. --- Page 50 Text --- PAUL: Traditionally swimmers were taught to hold their breath as it increases the level of buoyancy in the chest. This is certainly true but most swimmers already have plenty of buoyancy in the upper body, it is in the legs where it is lacking, especially if you are a triathlete with muscular legs. By smoothly exhaling into the water and removing excess buoyancy in the chest, we can counteract this and get your legs higher in the water. This is a classic example of our philosophy of ‘Cause and Effect’ in swimming. Elite swimmer Jono Van Hazel shows us his excellent exhalation technique through the nose. To really contrast the difference a good exhalation technique makes, trying swimming 100 m straight through as: 25 m exhaling smoothly 25 m holding your breath and exhaling at the last second 25 m exhaling smoothly 25 m holding again ADAM: The key point to remember with exhalation is that as swimmers we are not usually restricted by how much air we can get in but how efficiently we exhale out.

and exhaling at the last second 25 m exhaling smoothly 25 m holding again ADAM: The key point to remember with exhalation is that as swimmers we are not usually restricted by how much air we can get in but how efficiently we exhale out. Clearing the lungs smoothly before taking a deep breath of air on the next inhalation (without gasping) will really help to keep you more relaxed and aerobic in the water. --- OCR from Page 50 Image 2 --- ey eee eS --- Page 51 Text --- You will really notice the contrast, the difference a good exhalation technique can make is truly amazing! THE BUBBLE BUBBLE BREATHE MANTRA Now is an excellent time to experiment with some bilateral breathing if you have not done so already – a better exhalation technique will make things much easier for you to go from breathing every two strokes to breathing every three. As we will see when we look at bilateral breathing in a little more depth later on, it is usually the fear that if breathing every two strokes is challenging already, how could you possibly breathe every three? Try this simple mantra: Take a breath and then on each of the following two strokes say ‘bubble’ into the water. Literally speak it into the water to emphasise the exhalation during each stroke! On the third stroke take a breath to that side whilst saying ‘breathe’ to yourself (not out loud!). Swimming down the lap repeating ‘breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe’ is a great way to coordinate good exhalation with the timing required to breathe every three strokes (bilateral breathing). The chances are you might still feel rather strange breathing to your unfamiliar side but with the tips that follow, we will show you how to improve that too. Using the

is a great way to coordinate good exhalation with the timing required to breathe every three strokes (bilateral breathing). The chances are you might still feel rather strange breathing to your unfamiliar side but with the tips that follow, we will show you how to improve that too. Using the Bow Wave An efficient stroke technique keeps the head low in the water when breathing. Many swimmers feel that they need to lift their heads to find air but lifting the head excessively causes the whole upper torso to lift and the legs to sink, creating a large amount of drag. The secret to keeping your head low in the water is to breathe into the trough of air formed by the bow wave created around your head. Every swimmer has a bow wave, it’s formed as the head pushes forwards through the water creating a small rise in the water in front of the head and then a trough alongside the chin and neck – a channel of air beneath the main surface level of the water. It’s important to appreciate that the bow wave forms off the top of your head and is just deep enough to breathe into by the time it passes the level of your mouth. If you lift your head clear out of the water to breathe then the bow wave will not form off the top of your head and so the trough will not be there for you! This is a very common occurrence for those swimmers who feel they must lift their heads excessively high to keep from swallowing water. Ironically enough, if this instinctive action can be controlled and the head kept lower when breathing, it becomes much easier to get a breath in. Equally though, some swimmers completely bury

common occurrence for those swimmers who feel they must lift their heads excessively high to keep from swallowing water. Ironically enough, if this instinctive action can be controlled and the head kept lower when breathing, it becomes much easier to get a breath in. Equally though, some swimmers completely bury their heads in the water in an effort to improve body position which, as we will see in Chapter 8, might not be necessary for every swimmer. Furthermore, the act of burying the head may be problematic if it is too deep to cause the bow wave to form cleanly. The bow wave forms at the top of your head as it travels through the water; it causes a trough of air beside your mouth to breathe into. --- Page 52 Text --- When developing a good bow-wave breathing technique think about keeping the top of your head low in the water and try and breathe ever so slightly behind you into area (A) shown in Figure 7.4. If you crane your head forwards (B) then the bow wave isn’t as deep, which makes breathing much harder. Many swimmers who spend a lot of time training in the open water often develop position (B) from trying to sight forwards and breathe at the same time, as we will see in Chapter 35 this is something to be avoided. FIGURE 7.4 The ideal breathing angle is (A) where the bow wave is quite deep. If you breathe slightly too far forwards (B) then you will have to crane your head high to reach air. Popeye Breathing: A great way to avoid taking on water when breathing is to angle your mouth to the side like Popeye when he’s chewing his spinach! This lets you keep your head a little lower whilst

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
SCREEN VISUALISATION When you are working on keeping your head position low in the water, use fins and aim for a Split Screen View with the lower goggle beneath the water and the upper goggle above. You should be able to see under and over the water at the same time. This is a useful visualisation to revisit when training or racing and your stroke starts to feel ragged, especially during long distance swims when it can be hard to maintain concentration. Keep one goggle under the water as you breathe and you will see the split screen view. PAUL: Have you ever wondered why elite sprinters breathe so infrequently during a 50 m or 100 m freestyle race? Even at the pointy end of the field a swimmer’s balance and alignment in the water can be thrown off by turning to take a breath, which can make the difference between first and last place in close races. As a result elite sprinters breathe as infrequently as they can. For distances over 100m we need to maintain a much more regular stream of air into the lungs by using a much more frequent breathing pattern: breathing only two or three times per 50 m is not an option over longer distances! With regular breathing we need to maintain a close eye on your stroke while you are taking a breath; it’s easy to switch your focus completely towards getting the air in, and it is then that things go wrong in your stroke technique. As we get into other areas of stroke technique we’ll often be asking you to let the breath take care of itself and maintain an awareness of another part of your stroke. Bilateral Breathing Bilateral breathing is the ability to breathe to the left and the

in your stroke technique. As we get into other areas of stroke technique we’ll often be asking you to let the breath take care of itself and maintain an awareness of another part of your stroke. Bilateral Breathing Bilateral breathing is the ability to breathe to the left and the right, swapping sides regularly as you swim. We are big fans of bilateral breathing at Swim Smooth for a very practical reason: it helps keep your stroke symmetrical. Many swimmers find bilateral breathing hard at first, if you have tried and failed before don’t worry, we will help you crack it! Most people think of bilateral breathing as breathing every three strokes. This is certainly the most common way and the one we’d recommend for you to use as it’s about the right duration between breaths. However, any breathing pattern where you swap sides regularly is bilateral breathing too, for example: Breathing 2-3-2-3: This means breathing twice to one side in a row and then performing three strokes to swap to the other side for two breaths in a row. This breathing pattern is used by many elite swimmers when racing. --- Page 55 Text --- Breathing 5s: Breathing every five strokes can be useful for those with a fast stroke rate who find that breathing every three comes around too often. Swapping sides every lap of the pool: This is often done for tactical reasons to keep a close eye on a competitor in another lane, or simply for something different and engaging. Breathing just to one side is the leading cause of a lopsided stroke, creating issues such as snaking and scissor kicks. If you are a triathlete or open water swimmer then you should be seriously concerned with the symmetry of your stroke. A lopsided stroke is

something different and engaging. Breathing just to one side is the leading cause of a lopsided stroke, creating issues such as snaking and scissor kicks. If you are a triathlete or open water swimmer then you should be seriously concerned with the symmetry of your stroke. A lopsided stroke is never a good thing but in the pool you can minimise the harm done by keeping yourself straight with the guidance of the black line and the lane ropes. However in open water a lop-sided stroke is a serious liability as it will cause you to constantly track off course and swim much further than you have to. What is the most natural way to keep your stroke symmetrical? Bilateral breathing of course! Even if you feel you are slightly slower in the pool breathing bilaterally, you’ll gain back all this time and much more in open water by swimming much straighter. How much of your training should you perform breathing bilaterally? If possible, all of it. Some swimmers struggle with hard sets breathing every three strokes; if that is you then we would still encourage you to perform as much as possible breathing to both sides, even if you only think of bilateral breathing as a drill. As long as the majority of your training is bilateral then your stroke should stay symmetrical. PAUL: Perhaps you’re thinking: ‘this is all very well but I just can’t hold my breath for three strokes!’. But right there lies the problem – you should never hold your breath when you swim! We started this chapter by developing a good exhalation technique and this is the key you need to unlock the door to bilateral breathing. If you hold your breath the CO builds up in your lungs and blood stream, and you

you should never hold your breath when you swim! We started this chapter by developing a good exhalation technique and this is the key you need to unlock the door to bilateral breathing. If you hold your breath the CO builds up in your lungs and blood stream, and you start to feel 2 very desperate for air. You would never hold your breath when cycling or running and you shouldn’t when swimming either. Rid yourself of that CO and bilateral breathing becomes a whole lot more achievable. 2 There are certain situations, when racing in the pool or in the open water, when unilateral breathing would be more beneficial than bilateral breathing, which we will discuss further in Chapter 36. Your ability to breathe equally well to either side will be a tactical trump card in racing situations so that you can draft another swimmer closely or --- Page 56 Text --- keep a close eye on a competitor who might put in a surge at any point. Practicing breathing to both sides in training will give you this ability in races. The Two-Week Bilateral Hump If you are lucky you will take easily to bilateral breathing but most swimmers find it a little strange and awkward at first breathing to their less favoured side. That’s OK, allow yourself about two weeks (or six sessions) to persevere and keep your discipline with it. We call this the ‘two-week bilateral hump’ after which breathing to both sides should start to feel progressively easier every time you swim. The mistake many swimmers make is to try bilateral breathing for a session or two and then give up – keep your discipline a little longer and you can crack it! PAUL: But what about the argument that bilateral breathing makes you less

same time: With good breathing timing, the head slightly leads body rotation. Many swimmers, even some elite swimmers, turn the head a fraction later once the body is already rotated. If breathing to your right for example, the right arm will already be into its recovery phase over the top of the water before you start breathing. When viewed from the side of the pool this can look like the swimmer will knock their nose with their right shoulder as the arm comes over. Late breathing reduces the time available to inhale and makes breathing feel a little tense and hurried. TURNING YOUR HEAD AWAY FROM YOUR ARM This is a useful visualisation to help you improve your breathing timing. If you are about to breathe to your left then as your right hand passes your head and extends forwards, turn your head smoothly away from that arm. This should be one fluid motion with the head rotating as the hand enters the water. If you breathe late, you’ll still be trying to inhale as the top arm is about to enter the water. --- Page 58 Text --- The top sequence shows classic late breathing with the body rotated (1–2) before breathing high in the air (3). The bottom sequence shows good timing and technique with the head turning away to a low breathing position as the body rotates. It’s common for your breathing timing to be better on one side of your stroke than the other and in fact it is normally your preferred breathing side which has late timing! Although you may feel less comfortable breathing to your un-favoured side you will not have developed any bad habits there and so are likely to have better breathing technique, with better timing and less head lift. --- Page

fact it is normally your preferred breathing side which has late timing! Although you may feel less comfortable breathing to your un-favoured side you will not have developed any bad habits there and so are likely to have better breathing technique, with better timing and less head lift. --- Page 59 Text --- CHAPTER 8 Body Position A high body position in the water is very important for fast, efficient swimming: the legs, hips and feet should all be in one horizontal line near the surface. A swimmer with low-lying legs in the water creates a huge amount of drag, slowing them down dramatically. If you swim more quickly or more easily with a pull buoy between your legs, or are dramatically quicker in a wetsuit, then this is a strong indication that a low body position is a serious issue in your stroke. If you have a low body position in the water then you need to work on improving it as an absolute priority for your swimming: it will be the single biggest thing holding you back. The most common causes of a poor body position are: Holding Your Breath Underwater (Chapter 7). Holding onto your breath creates excess buoyancy in the chest, which lifts you up at the front and sinks your legs. Work on developing a nice smooth exhalation into the water. Michelle has a great body position in the water with chest, hips, legs and feet all in a horizontal line. A High-Lifting Head When Breathing (Chapter 7). In a similar manner to holding your breath, lifting your head high to breathe causes you to pivot at your hips and sink your legs. Developing your bow-wave breathing technique is essential to improving your body position. Looking Too Far Forward in the Water (this chapter). Many

Breathing (Chapter 7). In a similar manner to holding your breath, lifting your head high to breathe causes you to pivot at your hips and sink your legs. Developing your bow-wave breathing technique is essential to improving your body position. Looking Too Far Forward in the Water (this chapter). Many new swimmers with poor natural buoyancy and a feeling of breathing anxiety will swim looking too far forward in the water which in turn can sink the legs at the back. --- OCR from Page 59 Image 1 --- TOR ET ETRE --- Page 60 Text --- Kicking From The Knee (Chapter 9). A poor kicking technique with excess knee bend adds a lot of drag and sinks the legs. Work on moving to a kicking technique with a straighter leg driven from the hip. Scissor Kick (Chapter 9). A scissor kick is normally caused by a crossover of the lead arm in front of the head. This causes a loss of balance and with it an involuntary scissoring of the legs to avoid toppling onto your back. By improving your hand entry and swimming posture (Chapters 10 and 12) you will remove the scissor kick and so improve your body position. Dorsi Flexed Ankles (Chapter 9). Poor ankle flexibility is a problem for many triathletes with a running or cycling background. Such sports create a lot of stability in the ankle, which harms the swimmer’s ability to point their toes. The resultant drag causes the legs to drop down. Under Kicking (Chapter 9). Swimmers who are focusing on making their stroke very long often try a two-beat kick to further reduce effort. For many swimmers with poor natural buoyancy or poor ankle flexibility this does not produce enough lift and their legs sink downward. Poor Core Stabilisation (Chapter 10).

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
good hand entry and catch harder. It makes it hard to see forwards in open water, which damages your navigation and drafting abilities. As we will see in Chapter 36, drafting alone can save you up to 38% of your energy expenditure – a huge reduction that would be unwise to ignore. It bends your spine forward and thus harms your swimming posture, making crossovers in front of the head more likely (Chapter 10). --- Page 62 Text --- Furthermore, for swimmers with good stroke technique and good natural buoyancy, a low head position can bring their legs too high at the rear and make them feel very unbalanced and unstable in the water. For such swimmers this is exacerbated further when using a wetsuit where the extra buoyancy pushes their legs higher still. Adopting a higher head position is essential for these swimmers to regain their balance and swim well in a wetsuit. We’ll discuss this more with regard to Kicktastics in Chapter 20 and also in Chapter 38. You can choose from a range of head positions as you swim depending upon your individual stroke correction needs. Head technique is a very individual area of stroke technique, something that works for one swimmer will not necessarily work for another. Ian Thorpe’s Head Position The legendary Australian swimmer Ian Thorpe won four Olympic gold medals and set numerous world records in the 200 m and 400 m freestyle. Often held up as having one of the most efficient freestyle strokes of all time, as Ian developed his swimming as a junior he found that he needed to keep a very high head position with his eyes just beneath the surface looking forward. With a lower head his legs rose up out of the water and he lost balance in

strokes of all time, as Ian developed his swimming as a junior he found that he needed to keep a very high head position with his eyes just beneath the surface looking forward. With a lower head his legs rose up out of the water and he lost balance in his stroke and the effectiveness of his brilliant kick. Just like Ian, think about how your head position affects your swimming and choose the best position for your individual stroke. --- Page 63 Text --- Ian Thorpe used a very high head position when he swam, looking forwards with his goggles just beneath the surface. Heels Breaking the Surface The easiest way to check your body position is to ask a coach or friend to check if your heels are lightly breaking the surface as you swim. Make sure you are not doing this by bending excessively at the knee – your heels breaking the surface is only the sign of a good body position if you are achieving this with a good kicking technique, kicking mostly with a straight leg from the hip. PAUL: Some swimmers will kick their feet completely out of the water. Whilst this may appear to be very propulsive (especially when sprinting) the reverse is actually true and this action can create a huge amount of additional drag and wasted effort. In fact, an unpublished computational fluid dynamics (CFD) study of Australian sprinter Eamon Sullivan’s stroke (Olympic medallist and former holder of 50 m and 100 m world records) in 2010 by Matt Keys and the University of Western Australia [1], found that the only inefficiency in his stroke was that very occasionally his left foot would kick a little too high out of the water. For most of us, addressing this is something that

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
to 15% of their propulsion with their legs when kicking hard in a race, the other 85% to 90% being generated with their arm stroke [1]. For elite swimmers this small contribution from the kick is worth having as elite races are very close and every fraction of a second gained is critical. However, maximising the leg kick comes at a very high energy cost – for the effort they put in, the propulsion gained is small. Elite swimmers also have fantastic flexibility through the ankles, knees and hips, to the point where they nearly look double-jointed. This helps them generate foot angles that push water back behind them as they kick, propelling them forwards. For most age-group swimmers this level of flexibility is not realistically achievable unless it comes from a significant swimming background acquired during childhood. For triathletes, a very high level of ankle flexibility is undesirable for cycling and running as the lack of stability can easily lead to lower leg injuries such as calf problems and turned ankles. To generate propulsion from the leg kick a high amount of ankle flexibility is required. Elite swimmers are able to flex their feet well beyond straight. --- Page 65 Text --- For these reasons, developing a propulsive leg kick is unrealistic for most age-group swimmers and triathletes who may, at best, only generate 5 % of their propulsion from their legs. Over the longer distances raced by these swimmers, the energy saved by reducing kick effort is better utilised with the arm stroke instead, resulting in a faster more efficient stroke overall. Kicking from the Hip A good kicking technique is driven from the hip rather than from the knee; the knee itself is loose and relaxed and will bend slightly during the action. Triathletes are particularly prone

utilised with the arm stroke instead, resulting in a faster more efficient stroke overall. Kicking from the Hip A good kicking technique is driven from the hip rather than from the knee; the knee itself is loose and relaxed and will bend slightly during the action. Triathletes are particularly prone to driving the kick from the knee with a lot of knee bend, perhaps as if they are running or cycling in the water. This takes a lot of energy to maintain and creates a lot of drag as the front of the leg is presented to the water flow. Kicking from the knee also uses the large quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups, which burn a lot of oxygen. If you always seem out of breath when you swim, you could well be kicking too much from the knee in this way. Kicking from the hip with a relaxed straight leg is a much better swimming technique. It takes less energy and keeps the body high in the water resulting in much lower levels of drag. To develop this technique, use the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick And Swim Back drills from Appendix A. Paula (top) and Michelle (bottom) have contrasting kicking techniques at the same point in their strokes. Paula’s kick is driven from the knee, creating a lot of drag and starting to sink her legs downward. Michelle kicks with a much straighter leg driven from the hip, giving her a much higher body position. The Ballet Leg Kick Drill helps you to develop your kick technique from the hip – see Appendix A. --- Page 66 Text --- L–R: Toes lightly brushing; which can only be achieved by turning the toes inwards; not turning them outwards.

Leg Kick Drill helps you to develop your kick technique from the hip – see Appendix A. --- Page 66 Text --- L–R: Toes lightly brushing; which can only be achieved by turning the toes inwards; not turning them outwards. Turning Your Toes Inwards An important part of a good kicking technique is to turn your feet inwards slightly so that the big toes brush against each other as they pass. Many swimmers who struggle with their kicking do the opposite and turn their toes outwards. This creates drag and reduces the lift created by the kick. As you swim think about turning your toes in and brush your big toes lightly together as they pass with a tap-tap-tap action. You can practise doing this at any time when you swim, it’s particularly useful to try when you get a little tired and you feel like your stroke is becoming ragged – it will often bring things back together for you. --- Page 67 Text --- PAUL: Have you noticed how women tend to be better at kicking than men? Women are often more flexible than men but also have wider hips due to childbirth. The ‘Q-angle’ created between the hip and knee is more conducive to achieving this slightly pigeon-toed kicking position with the feet. This gives them an anatomical advantage over the guys and turning their toes in feels a lot more natural to them. Men with very narrow hips tend to find themselves kicking hard as their toes tend to do the opposite – turn outwards. So guys, you now have an excuse for why your kick isn’t ‘all that’ but don’t let this deter you. Work on turning your toes inwards to improve the effectiveness of your kick. Ankle Flexibility Even though you’re not looking for

toes tend to do the opposite – turn outwards. So guys, you now have an excuse for why your kick isn’t ‘all that’ but don’t let this deter you. Work on turning your toes inwards to improve the effectiveness of your kick. Ankle Flexibility Even though you’re not looking for propulsion from your kick, a lack of flexibility in your ankles can still hold you back. Very stiff ankles from field sports, running or cycling make the top of the foot stick out into the water flow. This creates resistance in itself but also pulls the legs downward, harming your body position and creating a lot of drag. Dorsi flexion (left) and Plantar flexion (right). THE SEA ANCHORS DRILL To experience this for yourself, experiment with using the Sea Anchors Drill. Using a pull buoy, swim 25 m with your toes pointed behind you (technical term: plantar flexion) as normal. Then bring your ankles to 90° with the toes pointing downward (dorsi flexion). Notice the instant and huge effect this has on your body position, which highlights the difference even small improvements in ankle flexibility can bring to your stroke. Using a pull buoy, try switching between dorsi and plantar flexed ankles to experience the effect it has on your body position. If you have very stiff ankles and cannot point your toes straight then we recommend a gentle stretching exercise to loosen off your ankles. You can perform this stretch at any time, perhaps in your office or in front of the TV at home. Don’t rush things, it will take many weeks and months to loosen your ankles off by stretching them little and often using the stretches below. --- Page 68 Text --- Sitting Ankle Stretch ADAM: Many swimmers think that using fins (flippers) in training is

Don’t rush things, it will take many weeks and months to loosen your ankles off by stretching them little and often using the stretches below. --- Page 68 Text --- Sitting Ankle Stretch ADAM: Many swimmers think that using fins (flippers) in training is cheating in some way. Nothing could be further from the truth – performing drills with a specific purpose using fins is a very important part of developing your stroke technique as they leave you free to focus on the drill rather than on how hard you need to kick to stay afloat! Did you know that fins can also improve your ankle flexibility and kicking technique at the same time? Any time you kick with fins on they place your feet into a plantar flexed position and so gradually stretch your ankles. They also force you to kick with a straighter leg action. You don’t want to become addicted to swimming with fins but performing a drill set or technique swim of around 400 m will help tune up your leg kick at the same time as you work on other areas of your stroke. Neat! In a seated position cross one leg over the top of the other and hold the foot firmly with the opposing hand. Gently pull the foot straighter, feeling the stretch across the top of the foot and along the shin. Hold for 30 seconds to a minute and then swap sides. As always when stretching use only light force and progress very gradually to avoid injury. A scissor kick adds a huge amount of drag, it’s like opening up a parachute behind you. --- OCR from Page 68 Image 1 --- int titi MG en Ea --- Page 69 Text --- Scissor Kicks A

stretching use only light force and progress very gradually to avoid injury. A scissor kick adds a huge amount of drag, it’s like opening up a parachute behind you. --- OCR from Page 68 Image 1 --- int titi MG en Ea --- Page 69 Text --- Scissor Kicks A scissor kick is one of the most common stroke flaws. In fact our records show that approximately 70% of swimmers who attend a Swim Smooth Clinic have a scissor kick in their stroke. Parting the legs like this causes a lot of drag and harms a swimmer’s body position in the water. However, a scissor kick is rarely a problem with the kick itself, instead it’s normally caused by an arm crossing the centre line in front of the head or under the body. This ‘crossover’ causes a loss of balance for the swimmer who parts the legs in a scissoring action to maintain balance, often doing so unknowingly. Fixing the crossover (Chapter 10) will normally remove the scissor kick all by itself, even without any conscious action on behalf of the swimmer. 2-Beat Kicking Technique A 2-beat kick is used by some elite swimmers racing in the pool and open water. For every two arm strokes, two leg kicks are made. The kicks don’t provide much propulsion but they do help drive body rotation, which in turn helps drive the arm stroke. A 2-beat kick suits swimmers with a faster stroke rate style, such as the Swinger Swim Type. A great 2-beat leg kick is poetry in motion and whilst it looks simple is deceptively difficult to master. Generally speaking we only recommend 2-beat kicks for those swimmers with a refined Swinger style (Chapter 22). The Classic Overglider (left) uses a large knee bend to kick-start their stroke after

A great 2-beat leg kick is poetry in motion and whilst it looks simple is deceptively difficult to master. Generally speaking we only recommend 2-beat kicks for those swimmers with a refined Swinger style (Chapter 22). The Classic Overglider (left) uses a large knee bend to kick-start their stroke after the long glide phase. Simply becoming aware of this, and by tuning up his rhythm, has allowed Chris to improve his kicking technique (right). --- Page 70 Text --- The timing for the 2-beat kick is much the same as that of the 6-beat kick in that as the right hand enters into the water the left leg should be driving down, and as the left hand enters into the water the right leg should be driving down. Opposite arm to opposite leg. Or, to think of it another way, as the left arm is midway through its propulsive catch phase the left leg should be driving down. The timing of a 6-beat kick is the same as a 2-beat one except that two additional kicks are placed between each kick bringing the total up to six in a stroke cycle. The kicks of a 6-beat kick are more of a flutter and should be smaller than those of a 2-beat. Sounds a bit complicated? It is, and we have not even hit the water yet! For most swimmers and triathletes Swim Smooth recommend a light 6-beat kick as the most efficient kicking technique. Some age-group swimmers have tried to combine a very long slow stroke style with a 2-beat kick but this is rarely effective. The tendency here is for the stroke to stall completely during the long pause between arm strokes and kicks, which harms the swimmer’s rhythm and timing. These swimmers are often seen from under the

combine a very long slow stroke style with a 2-beat kick but this is rarely effective. The tendency here is for the stroke to stall completely during the long pause between arm strokes and kicks, which harms the swimmer’s rhythm and timing. These swimmers are often seen from under the water using a substantial kick from the knee to literally kick-start the stroke back into motion after the pause but in doing so add significant drag at the back of the stroke from their knees sitting too deep in the water. We’ll take a closer look at this in the Overglider Swim Type profile and correction processes in Chapter 21. --- Page 71 Text --- PAUL: Back in August 2008 I decided to modify my stroke technique to emulate that of one of my heroes and mentors of open water swimming, seven-time World Marathon Swimming Champion Shelley Taylor-Smith. I already had a reasonable open water technique from my days as an elite triathlete but with my goal of swimming the English Channel in 2011 I wanted to be assured of my ability to maintain the most economical marathon swimming technique for 8–12 hours depending on conditions. I was concerned that my strong 6-beat kick and ‘longish’ stroke (34–35 strokes per 50 m) at a moderate stroke rate of 64 SPM (strokes per minute) might have been OK in events up to 1500 m but could potentially be too fatiguing above this. I was also concerned that this low stroke rate may not have the momentum to carry me through some of the swell and chop that I would encounter in the Channel. It took me over 10 weeks, swimming six sessions per week, before I started to get a true feeling of how this new stroke would work for me.

may not have the momentum to carry me through some of the swell and chop that I would encounter in the Channel. It took me over 10 weeks, swimming six sessions per week, before I started to get a true feeling of how this new stroke would work for me. Converting the 6-beat kick timing to 2-beat was very taxing mentally as I became slower to begin with and for this reason I wouldn’t recommend the transition to everyone. The new stroke involved combining a 2-beat kick with a significantly higher stroke rate (80 SPM) but not being concerned about taking more strokes per lap (increasing to 41–43 strokes per 50 m). What I gave away in stroke length I more than made up for in rate and rhythm. Now that I have mastered it, this new stroke is not only faster than the old one at any distance over 400 m (more details in Chapter 27) but is considerably more economical for the type of events I now do – marathon swimming. It doesn’t appear quite as smooth or textbook as my old style but in open water there are no points for style, only performance!

456–459). Worthington, Ohio: Bertec Corporation. --- Page 72 Text --- CHAPTER 10 Posture and Alignment When thinking about core stability we tend to think about the abdominals, lower back and hip region of the body. This area of the body was the subject of the core stability boom across the sports world in the mid to late 1990s. In swimming terms we would call this the ‘lower core’ and like in many sports, it plays an important role in the pool as we’ll investigate in this chapter. However, the ‘upper core’ – a swimmer’s thoracic spine, their shoulder and scapular region – is thought about much less often but is arguably even more important for good swimming technique. ADAM: One of my roles at Swim Smooth is to manage all of our swimming websites and I spend a lot of time in front of the computer doing this. Working at a computer draws the shoulders and head forwards, shortening the chest muscles and over-stretching between the shoulder blades. As we’ll see in this section, if you have an office job yourself this hunched posture could be doing your swimming real harm. Poor posture at work (left) can negatively impact your swimming but try to avoid over-exaggerating good posture (right) as this puts pressure on your lower back. When we swim we enter the water and extend forwards, the lead hand being controlled by the shoulder, chest and scapular region muscle groups. If your chest muscles are short and the muscles between your scapulae over-stretched, then this tends to draw the lead arm across the centre line of the body causing a crossover in front of the head. A crossover in front of the head is caused by poor swimming posture. --- Page 73 Text --- The solution to a crossover

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
have a crossover in your stroke or you lack body rotation then it’s very likely that you need to work on your swimming posture in this way. Improving your posture will also increase the length of your stroke as it helps you extend forward much straighter, this is of direct benefit to your swimming efficiency. We will take a good look at some exercises and drills in this section to help you tune in to this part of your --- Page 74 Text --- stroke and we’ll recommend some simple stretches to help loosen off your chest and shoulders in Chapter 29. Transferring Power from Your Rotation to Your Arm Stroke Hopefully you can see how your upper core helps connect your arm stroke to your body. Swimming with good posture forms a strong connection between the two and lets you utilise the larger muscle groups of the chest and upper back to help drive the arm stroke. Swimming with poor posture tends to overload the weaker shoulder muscle groups, which will quickly fatigue. Having a stable upper core, combined with a good catch and rotation technique will really help you to generate some controlled power in the stroke. PAUL: The good news here is that you do not need to be physically strong to swim well, this is one reason why that 11-year-old girl can go zooming past you in the pool with very little upper-body strength. The key is to get in the right positions with a good stroke rhythm and that will produce the necessary power with surprisingly little feeling of force. Developing Better Posture in the Pool At Swim Smooth we like to use drills that involve kicking on your side to improve your posture.

stroke rhythm and that will produce the necessary power with surprisingly little feeling of force. Developing Better Posture in the Pool At Swim Smooth we like to use drills that involve kicking on your side to improve your posture. Many swimmers have performed similar drills before but normally think of them as rotational drills or something to improve their leg kick. However, the focus here is less about your rotation and more about your posture. Start off by performing the Kick On Side Drill described in Appendix A. Use a pair of fins (flippers) and kick gently to propel you down the pool, extending the lower arm out in front of you. Notice how aligned or otherwise your lead hand is, does it cross the centre line? This is a clear indication of what is happening with that arm in your full freestyle stroke too. Do you find you drift across the lane in the direction of the crossover? Think about bringing this arm straight by drawing your shoulder blades together and down. You should track much straighter when you get this right. Perform the drill looking straight down past your armpit exhaling in a long stream of bubbles. When you need a breath, rotate your head to the side and then return it to the water again. Keep your lead arm perfectly straight while you breathe and do not let it drop down in the water. The other arm should remain relaxed by your side as though your hand was in the front pocket of a pair of jeans. Side kicking with fins is the primary drill for working on your posture: Draw your shoulder blades together and down to bring the lead arm straight. --- Page 75 Text --- After 25m swap onto the other side. Repeat the

was in the front pocket of a pair of jeans. Side kicking with fins is the primary drill for working on your posture: Draw your shoulder blades together and down to bring the lead arm straight. --- Page 75 Text --- After 25m swap onto the other side. Repeat the exercise here, working on drawing your arm straight in front of you. It’s well worthwhile performing these exercises with a coach or friend watching you from the pool deck to give you feedback on your alignment. This Kick On Side Drill makes you aware of the alignment of your lead hand when you swim and it helps you tune into developing a better swimming posture. When you feel you have got the hang of this you can progress to the 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills. The 6-1-6 Drill involves kicking on your side again for around six kicks. Then perform one arm stroke to swap sides and kick on that side for six further kicks before swapping back again. This is a more challenging drill because you have got to maintain your posture during an arm stroke. Watch that you don’t crossover as you enter into the water and then straighten it up, you’re aiming to enter straight in the first place! Again, feedback from an observer is very useful here. The 6-3-6 Drill is slightly harder again and involves taking three full arm strokes between side kicking. You should start to feel the power coming into your stroke now as your improved posture helps drive the stroke. ADAM: In the Swim Smooth squads in Perth we perform a lot of these side kicking drills. They really help you maintain your stroke, simultaneously working on your posture, and as we will see later, helping you set up for a good catch

your improved posture helps drive the stroke. ADAM: In the Swim Smooth squads in Perth we perform a lot of these side kicking drills. They really help you maintain your stroke, simultaneously working on your posture, and as we will see later, helping you set up for a good catch too. One quick pointer on 6-1-6: make sure you breathe after the stroke not before. You could think of the drill as: 6-1-breathe-6. Once you’ve tried the side kicking exercises perform some full-stroke swimming using the Middle Finger Visualisation described in Chapter 12. Focus on entering into the water and extending your middle finger gun-barrel straight down the pool in front of --- Page 76 Text --- the same shoulder. If you own a pair of the excellent Finis Freestyler Paddles (see Chapter 3) you can also perform some swimming using them. These have a keel on the bottom of the paddle, which gives you kinaesthetic feedback on how straight you are in the water – crossover and you’ll feel them trying to spin off to that side! As you introduce arm strokes, maintain a focus on your lead arm staying straight and aligned. PAUL: Take the time to carefully read the pointers for these exercises in Appendix A. When you feel like you can perform them quite well, really aim to perfect them with perfect rotation (45° to 60° during the strokes and side kicking at 90°), perfect alignment and a good hand position out in front of you. Stay relaxed and keep exhaling smoothly and continuously into the water. THE 1-2-STRAIGHT MANTRA As you develop your swimming posture you may find that you stay well aligned on normal strokes but on a breathing stroke your crossover returns. This is only natural as during a breathing stroke your focus

abdominal area is important in swimming to keep you straight in the water and to help rotate your hips and shoulders together as one. Good core control during swimming has a slightly different feel to it compared to other sports, which can cause some confusion. The key to developing your lower core control is to feel a stretch between your pelvis and rib cage as you swim. In a sense you are trying to separate out the two as much as possible, raising the chest away from the hips. If you try this you will feel your posture improve at the same time as your chest is pushed out and your shoulders come back – great! Warning: avoid holding your breath when you do this. Michael Phelps has one of the best streamline positions in the world. See the Torpedo Kick and Swim Back Drill in Appendix A to see how to get into this position yourself. If you suffer from low-lying legs in the water the first benefit you may notice from improving your core control is that your legs are lifted higher so you slip through the water more easily. That’s a great sign that you’ve made a substantial improvement to your stroke! At Swim Smooth we use several visualisations to help you use your lower core in the right way: --- Page 78 Text --- TORPEDO KICK WITH FINS Kick continuously either on your front or back with your arms above your head in a torpedo position. The streamlined tuck requires you to stabilise your upper back and also stretches your shoulders and chest. Perform 50 m to 100 m at a time with fins on. Whenever you start any lap of freestyle you are aiming for a nice strong push-off in a streamlined tuck (see Appendix

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
The streamlined tuck requires you to stabilise your upper back and also stretches your shoulders and chest. Perform 50 m to 100 m at a time with fins on. Whenever you start any lap of freestyle you are aiming for a nice strong push-off in a streamlined tuck (see Appendix A). This is the perfect time to focus on your lower core using the visualisations below. As you break out in to your freestyle maintain that focus down the lap to integrate the ‘core engagement’ into your full stroke. STICK OF LIQUORICE STRETCH A nice way to think about stretching through the core is to imagine a stick of liquorice that is attached to your pelvis at one end and to your rib cage at the other. As you swim you must keep the liquorice stretched at all times! BUM CHEEK SQUEEZE! A slightly crude visualisation this one – imagine that you have a pound or dollar coin between the cheeks of your backside and to keep it there you must lightly squeeze your glute (buttock) muscles! This exercise also helps you kick more from the hip than the knee as the glute muscles are activated. TILTING PELVIS UPWARDS Think about rotating your pelvis upwards slightly (technical term: anterior tilt) so that your tail-bone is pulled up a little towards your lower back. Think about drawing your rib cage away from your hips as you swim by stretching tall through your core. --- Page 79 Text --- As essential as good lower core control is to your stroke technique, we can easily forget about it when we swim. An excellent way to remind yourself is to use a good torpedo push-off (also known as a streamline) at the beginning of every length which involves stretching through your core. Doing this

good lower core control is to your stroke technique, we can easily forget about it when we swim. An excellent way to remind yourself is to use a good torpedo push-off (also known as a streamline) at the beginning of every length which involves stretching through your core. Doing this will improve the connection between your upper and lower body at the beginning of every length and help remind you to keep that connection and feeling of stretch in place for the whole lap. PAUL: Many of the triathletes who swim with us in Perth think that they don’t need the discipline of a good torpedo push-off at the beginning of every lap because they don’t get to push off in open water. Whilst this is true, they are missing out on developing their core control when swimming which is so essential to avoid fish-tailing (legs sweeping from side to side) and to keep the body high in the water. Dry Land Core Conditioning Most swimmers and triathletes have enough core strength to swim very well, it’s more a matter of coordinating and engaging the core muscles in the right way. Unless you have very poor core strength indeed it’s not normally necessary to add in additional gym classes to your training routine. Saying that, a strong core has many benefits on dry land so we wouldn’t discourage you from a good pilates or yoga class either! Time availability will always be the limiting factor for most non-professional swimmers, so the more specifically you can introduce good core control into your normal swim sessions the better. PAUL: Just to prove this point, it’s normally the gym junkies who can do hundreds of sit-ups who have the worst core control in the water! For more information on dry-land conditioning that you

the more specifically you can introduce good core control into your normal swim sessions the better. PAUL: Just to prove this point, it’s normally the gym junkies who can do hundreds of sit-ups who have the worst core control in the water! For more information on dry-land conditioning that you can adopt within your programme in a time efficient way, see Chapters 29 and 30. --- Page 80 Text --- CHAPTER 11 Rotation and Arm Recovery Body rotation (sometimes simply called ‘body roll’) is the rotation of the swimmer along the long axis of the spine as they swim. A good freestyle stroke technique has between 45° and 60° of rotation to each side on every stroke, not just when they breathe. This helps the swimmer use the large muscle groups of the core, back and chest to help drive the stroke. A swimmer with poor rotation tends to overuse the small weak shoulder muscles, which soon fatigue. A swimmer should rotate between 45° and 60° on every stroke they take. --- Page 81 Text --- THE KEBAB STICK VISUALISATION Imagine that your body has been skewered on a kebab stick, running through your head and body down to your feet. As the kebab stick is rotated your body rotates as one with the legs, hips and shoulders rotating together. Rotate ‘as one’ along your long axis, as if you were skewered on a kebab stick! Many swimmers feel they should kick vertically at all times when they swim but this misconception can really harm your rotation. Instead you should kick with your rotation: Mr Smooth’s kick also rotates with his body roll. Developing Good Rotation --- Page 82 Text --- To develop your rotation use the Kick-On-Side, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drill sequences from Appendix A as described in Chapter

lead arm out in front giving you support. Notice how easy it feels now to recover the top arm to the front and how relaxed the shoulder is. Arm Clearance During the Recovery Phase An important benefit of good body rotation is that it improves your recovery over the top of the water. When elite pool swimmers perform a classic high elbow recovery, or --- OCR from Page 85 Image 1 --- el | decked oa e 1 ee joadnal (arene teen bt Lay --- Page 86 Text --- when elite open water swimmers achieve good clearance with their recovering arm in rough water, they do this with the combination of good shoulder mobility and good body rotation. If you struggle with an awkward recovery over the water, work on improving your body roll and your recovery will also improve and take some of the load off your shoulders that you may normally experience. Poor body rotation and stiff shoulders mean an awkward recovery round the side of the body for this swimmer. Low Awkward Arm Recovery The classic problem with arm recovery occurs when the swimmer struggles for clearance over the water. This makes the freestyle stroke quite awkward and causes the hand to lead the elbow during the recovery. A low awkward recovery is caused either by poor posture and shoulder flexibility or a lack of body rotation in the stroke. If you struggle with your arm recovery over the water, work on improving both your swimming posture and rotation (Chapters 10 and 11), the combination of which will make your recovery much easier and more relaxed. If you struggle with your arm recovery make sure you try the exercise shown in Figure 11.8 to experience the difference better body rotation will make to your swimming. A Drill

and rotation (Chapters 10 and 11), the combination of which will make your recovery much easier and more relaxed. If you struggle with your arm recovery make sure you try the exercise shown in Figure 11.8 to experience the difference better body rotation will make to your swimming. A Drill to Improve Your Arm Recovery The Popov Drill is named after the great Russian sprinter Alexander Popov who made this drill famous. Using fins, kick on your side as in 6-1-6 but straight away slowly slide the thumb of the top arm up the side of your body to your armpit. As soon as you reach your armpit slide the thumb back down to your hip before sliding it up again to the --- Page 87 Text --- armpit and then over into the water, stroking through onto the other side of the body. Repeat this continuously on the other side, swapping sides down the lap. The mantra of the drill is up-down-up-and-through. For a full description see Appendix A. The Popov Drill makes you adopt a relaxed arm recovery with good rotation in the stroke even though you probably won’t use such a tight elbow angle in your full stroke. Differing arm recovery styles from these elite swimmers: Jono Van Hazel on the right with a classic high elbow recovery, Mel Benson on the left with a lower swinging style. Arm Recovery in Elite Swimmers In the elite pool swimming world arm recovery styles vary considerably, with some swimmers using a classic high elbow technique while others use varying degrees of straighter arm recoveries. In the open water nearly all swimmers use a straighter arm recovery style which helps increase their arm clearance over waves and chop and also other swimmers in close proximity to them. PAUL: When I

using a classic high elbow technique while others use varying degrees of straighter arm recoveries. In the open water nearly all swimmers use a straighter arm recovery style which helps increase their arm clearance over waves and chop and also other swimmers in close proximity to them. PAUL: When I ask swimmers what is the most important aspect of good freestyle technique many will reply ‘high elbows!’ As we’ll see though this isn’t necessarily the case. For swimmers with tight shoulder muscles or those racing in open water, a slightly straighter arm recovery would be a better option. Swimmers favouring a higher stroke rate also naturally favour a straighter arm recovery with the arms swinging a little more around the side. As we’ll discuss in the Swim Type section of this book, we call this style of stroke The Swinger for exactly that reason. Swingers can be incredibly fast and efficient swimmers even though this style of stroke has traditionally been given a bad press in the swimming world. Experimenting with a Straighter Arm Recovery --- Page 88 Text --- If you are tight in the upper back and shoulders, or you are focused on racing well in open water, then experiment with some laps of freestyle using a slightly straighter arm than you are used to. Simply open out the elbow to different angles and see how it feels. You can expect it to feel strange at first but also notice how relaxed or otherwise the recovery feels. A straighter arm recovery really comes into its own in open water swims, helping you clear chop and wake from other swimmers. ADAM: Swimmers trying a straighter arm recovery for the first time often say that it feels strange and fear that it must look terrible! As a coach I work

we now understand that because it internally rotates the shoulder, it is the leading cause of shoulder injury in swimming and should be strongly avoided for this reason. If you’ve had a shoulder injury or are currently suffering from one, you’ll find our additional advice on this subject in Chapter 30 very useful. A thumb-first entry is also less effective in setting you up for a good catch as the hand tends to continue slicing down into the water after it has entered rather than engaging with the water at the front of your stroke. PAUL: If you’re serious about your swimming performances then you need to take every measure you can to avoid injury. I’ve been coaching swimmers of all levels for nearly 15 years and in that time it’s become very clear to me that consistency in preparation and training is the single most important factor in swimmers achieving their goals. Time out recovering from a shoulder injury will set you back significantly and you will lose the peak of fitness you would otherwise have achieved. You may have been swimming for many years and you may not wish to take the time and effort to change from a thumb-first to a fingertip-first hand entry but please understand the very high risk you are taking with the health of your shoulders by not doing so. Changing to a fingertip entry does take some time and persistence but it is so important to guarantee you a long and happy swimming career. Here are two useful visualisations you can use to help remove a thumb-first entry from your stroke: Visualise hiding your palm from someone watching you from the side of the pool, as if someone’s written a rude word on it! As your hand recovers over the surface of

elbow collapses in first this will harm the catch phase of the stroke that follows. A good exercise for practising a spearing hand entry is the Shoulder Tap Drill shown in Appendix A. With fins on, tap yourself on the shoulder before entering into the water using fingertip-first entry (palm facing down). The shoulder tap slows things down and gives you time to think and to ensure that you are entering from a high position angled downward. As you’ll see in the full drill description, breathe on every single stroke (both to the left and right) when performing Shoulder Tap and leave the other arm outstretched for balance. If you overreach on hand entry you will drop your elbow in first. --- Page 92 Text --- SPEARING FISH VISUALISATION To practice a positive hand entry into the water, imagine there’s a fish swimming in the water around 30 cm or 1 ft in front of you. As you swim, visualise spearing the fish as your enter the water with your hand like the blade of a spear. Enter with a big splash and you scare the fish away and disrupt the smoothness of your stroke. Enter cleanly, smoothly and stealthily and you will catch that fish! This is a simple but powerful way to focus on a clean hand entry and can be used at any time when you’re swimming or racing. A crossover in front of the head is seen in about 70% of attendees on our Swim Smooth Clinics. 3) Alignment Straight in Front of the Same Shoulder As your hand enters the water and extends forwards it should be perfectly in line with your shoulder.

Clinics. 3) Alignment Straight in Front of the Same Shoulder As your hand enters the water and extends forwards it should be perfectly in line with your shoulder. This keeps you tracking straight and sets you up for a good catch as you start the following stroke. This sounds simple but in reality very few beginner and intermediate level swimmers have good alignment in the water; most cross over the centre line to a greater or lesser extent as their hands enter and extend. As we saw in Chapter 10 on swimming posture, the key here is to draw your shoulder blades together and back to enter and extend straight forward in front of the same shoulder. --- Page 93 Text --- MIDDLE FINGER VISUALISATION A useful visualisation to improve your alignment on hand entry is to simply focus on the middle finger on each hand as it enters the water and extends forward. Think about that middle finger as you swim and nothing else, extending it straight down the pool as if you are aiming the barrel of a gun. ADAM: Entering and extending forward straight in front of the same shoulder sounds easy but it is something that could well be holding you back with your swimming. This is an area of swimming technique where visualisations are very powerful. Memorise how our animated swimmer Mr Smooth looks from the underside angle extending straight and aligned – if you haven’t done so already you can download him for free from www.swimsmooth.com. If you have our Catch Masterclass DVD also watch Jono Van Hazel just before you go to the pool and aim to reproduce his stroke in the water.

spear) gives you --- Page 94 Text --- immediate feedback on how straight you are entering. So much so that if you cross over or drop your elbow on entry then you’ll have trouble keeping them on your hands! The Finis Freestyler, a great paddle for working on your alignment and catch set- up. --- Page 95 Text --- CHAPTER 13 Catch and Pull-Through The catch and pull-through phases of the freestyle stroke are where a swimmer develops between 85% and 100% of their propulsion. The key to a great catch and pull is to feel the water during the catch phase and engage with it by pressing it in a backwards direction. Pressing the water back produces an opposite force propelling you forwards in the water. Problems that occur during the catch normally involve the swimmer pushing downward on the water, or sometimes to the side or even forward! Pushing downward on the water during the catch does not create any propulsion, instead it simply lifts the front end of the body upwards and sinks the legs. It’s no coincidence that swimmers with very low-lying legs in the water normally push down during the catch phase. If you suffer from a poor body position in your stroke then by improving your catch mechanics you will create more propulsion and your legs will be higher, lowering your drag. A win-win! Sam presses down on the water in comparison to elite swimmer Rhys Mainstone who presses the water backward by bending his elbow and tipping his wrist – great technique.

his elbow and tipping his wrist – great technique. ADAM: Many swimming coaches consider working on the catch and pull-through to be for advanced level swimmers only. At Swim Smooth we passionately believe that this is not the case! Approached in the right way, making improvements to your catch can be achieved quite easily and these changes will benefit your stroke technique as a whole. As we’ll see with our Swim Types system, many beginner swimmers have very poor feel for the water and lack any ‘oomph’ in their stroke rhythm. If you struggle to feel the water at all at the front of your stroke then developing a better catch is critical to help you progress. Let’s examine the movements of a good catch and pull-through step by step. By following the advice in the early steps of this chapter you will already have some of --- Page 96 Text --- these elements in place in your stroke: The hand enters the water cleanly using a spearing hand entry with the fingertips and palm facing downward. The arm extends straight forward, aligned with the shoulder. During arm extension the fingertips stay slightly lower than the wrist and the wrist slightly lower than the elbow at all times. The catch is initiated with a tipping of the wrist. This is momentary and easily missed when looking at video analysis of great swimmers. See Figure 13.9 for examples of this in elite swimmers’ strokes. --- OCR from Page 96 Image 3 --- ccccceuan BUCCUCRCCCeanetnenn --- Page 97 Text --- FIGURE 13.9 Examples of wrist tipping by elite swimmers, top-bottom: Mel Benson, Shelley Taylor-Smith, Rhys Mainstone.

The elbow bends and the forearm becomes more vertical in the water. --- OCR from Page 97 Image 2 --- a CE --- Page 98 Text --- As the hand travels under the head the pull phase is entered, with the hand and forearm now facing directly backwards. For distance swimming the depth of the pull is such that the elbow is bent somewhere between 100° and 120°. The hand does not cross the centre line or move outside elbow width during the whole stroke action. As the hand moves toward the back of the stroke the palm is kept facing straight backwards. --- OCR from Page 98 Image 2 --- «accc_oer AGRL) Wit SEE SS EE SS SS SS SS SS ES --- Page 99 Text --- At the rear of the push, the hand is turned slightly inward towards the thigh to finish the stroke as the hip on that side rotates upward. The arm exits once it has extended to around 150° of elbow bend. Note the arm is not fully extended with the elbow locked out. Don’t worry if that seems like a lot of information or even a bit overwhelming! The key thing to remember is that you are trying to press the water back behind you during the catch and pull-through underwater. Using a good mix of key drills and visualisations will help you tune into these movements and get a good feel for them. As you work on your arm stroke under the water, particularly during the catch, don’t become frustrated if it takes a little time to click into place in your stroke. Developing a good catch is

visualisations will help you tune into these movements and get a good feel for them. As you work on your arm stroke under the water, particularly during the catch, don’t become frustrated if it takes a little time to click into place in your stroke. Developing a good catch is challenging and is something that elite swimmers need to constantly work --- Page 100 Text --- on and maintain in their strokes too. However, even small improvements in your catch technique will have an immediate benefit to your speed and efficiency in the water, which you will notice straight away. A High Elbow Catch and Pull-Through You might have heard or been told by a swim coach to ‘keep your elbows high’ when you swim. Sometimes this comment refers to your arm recovery over the top of the water but as we saw in Chapter 11, a classically high elbow recovery over the water is now considered less important than it used to be in swimming technique. However, during the pull-through under the water a high elbow technique is essential to create good propulsion. The reason a high elbow technique is important is that it helps you press the water in the right direction – backwards – so that you are propelled forwards. It allows you to do this not only with the hand but your forearm too. This use of the forearm is important as it increases the surface area that you are using as a paddle in the water. Here are some examples of swimmers showing classic flaws in their catch technique. Notice how our animated swimmer maintains a high elbow in all these positions with the elbow higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips throughout: Ron pushes down on the water with a

water. Here are some examples of swimmers showing classic flaws in their catch technique. Notice how our animated swimmer maintains a high elbow in all these positions with the elbow higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips throughout: Ron pushes down on the water with a straight arm, this only lifts him up at the front and does not generate any forward propulsion. Greg crosses the centre line under his body, losing propulsion and his balance at the same time. Notice the scissor kick forming behind him as he has to stabilise himself. --- Page 101 Text --- Tim pulls through with a very straight arm under the body. This forces him to press down during the catch phase and overloads the weaker shoulder muscles. Henry drops his wrist and elbow and shows the palm forwards. Overgliders very often do this as they try to absolutely maximise stroke length. Tim drops his elbow just before the catch, from here he will find it nearly impossible to get his elbow up high for the catch to follow. The Limits of Flexibility If you have read a lot of material about swimming on the internet you might have come across the term Early Vertical Forearm or ‘EVF’ for short. This refers to some elite swimmers’ ability to achieve a very vertical forearm position early in the stroke in front of the head. This is technically very difficult to perform and requires a lot of flexibility and stability in the shoulder joint; for adult age-group swimmers and triathletes we recommend a less extreme position at this point in stroke. --- Page 102 Text --- See Figure 13.10 for a comparison of these positions, note that the elbow is still higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the

the shoulder joint; for adult age-group swimmers and triathletes we recommend a less extreme position at this point in stroke. --- Page 102 Text --- See Figure 13.10 for a comparison of these positions, note that the elbow is still higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips in a more conventional catching position. The conventional catch still creates a lot of propulsion and allows you to swim very quickly indeed. Olympic swimmer Jono Van Hazel who features in our Catch Masterclass DVD swam sub-50 seconds for 100m using such a catch, so there is no shortage of speed available! FIGURE 13.10 An extreme ‘EVF position’ (top) has the arm nearly vertical in front of the head. A conventional catch (bottom) has a less extreme vertical forearm. Your Strength and the Catch Referring to Figure 13.11 try the following practical exercise: FIGURE 13.11 Use a friend or coach to investigate your muscular recruitment in the catch position. --- Page 103 Text --- Position 1: Stand square on and face your friend with your arm locked straight out in front of you. Have them support your hand and press down on it hard. Notice how all the effort is coming from your shoulder muscles and how your friend does not struggle to resist you too much. This is not because you are not strong but because all the effort is coming from your shoulders, which are a relatively small, weak muscle group. This position demonstrates a poor catch technique with the swimmer pushing down on the water with a straight arm. Position 2: Standing in the same position, now bend your elbow and again push down on your friend’s hand. Notice how you are now starting to engage your back and chest muscle groups, which are stronger –

technique with the swimmer pushing down on the water with a straight arm. Position 2: Standing in the same position, now bend your elbow and again push down on your friend’s hand. Notice how you are now starting to engage your back and chest muscle groups, which are stronger – your friend should notice the increase in force you --- Page 104 Text --- can create here. However, we know that this position is still not correct as the elbow is dropped and the body is not rotated. Position 3: Rotate your feet and body to be more side-on to your friend and bend your elbow but keep it high so the elbow is higher than the wrist and the wrist is higher than the fingertips. In this position think about pressing the water back behind you rather than pushing it downward. Notice how you can really engage your chest and back muscles here and easily generate a lot of force. You will see from this position where the term ‘reaching over a barrel’ comes from. The key point with this exercise is to show you how a good catching position on the water allows you to use larger more powerful muscle groups. This makes it easy to generate the forces required during the catch. So easy in fact that when they start to get this right swimmers either pull too hard and overpower the catch or it feels too easy and they think it cannot be correct – surely a good catch should feel solid and hard? Actually a good catch is a relatively light connection with the water and should not feel overly forceful or hurried. One more thing to perfect this exercise. Did you notice in the third position that your shoulder was rolled inwards as shown

a good catch should feel solid and hard? Actually a good catch is a relatively light connection with the water and should not feel overly forceful or hurried. One more thing to perfect this exercise. Did you notice in the third position that your shoulder was rolled inwards as shown in the left hand pictures? As we discussed in Chapter 10 this is poor swimming posture. Whilst in this position think about drawing your shoulder blades together and your shoulders back and down. Notice how this really connects your arm to your body for a great catch! Developing Your Catch Step 1: Catch Set-up --- Page 105 Text --- Alignment and Posture The first step to developing your catch is to refer back to Chapter 10 where we looked at improving your alignment and posture in the water. Use the steps there to straighten out your stroke and ensure that you are entering the water and extending forward with the hand straight in front of the shoulder. If you cross over the centre line in your stroke then you will find it nearly impossible to catch and pull-through effectively on the following stroke. PAUL: A common mistake that I see many swimmers making is to rush straight to developing their catch mechanics – i.e. the bent elbow pull-through itself. Whilst this is important, if you don’t first focus on the stage in your stroke immediately before, developing your catch will be a fruitless and frustrating exercise for you. Take the time to improve your catch set-up using the tips in this section – they can make improvements to your propulsion even without focusing on the catch itself. Whilst performing the Kick-On-Side, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills, introduce a new focus on the position and angle of the lead hand itself. During

time to improve your catch set-up using the tips in this section – they can make improvements to your propulsion even without focusing on the catch itself. Whilst performing the Kick-On-Side, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills, introduce a new focus on the position and angle of the lead hand itself. During this exercise, are you dropping the wrist and showing the palm forwards or perhaps facing the palm sideways in a karate chop position? Have you dropped the elbow lower than the wrist and fingertips? Classic mistakes whilst kicking on your side: crossing over the centre line (left) and dropping the wrist and showing the palm forwards (right). To generate a good catch we need to get the hand and elbow in a good set-up position at this point in the stroke. As you kick on your side focus on keeping your elbow slightly higher than your wrist and the palm itself facing downward to the bottom of the pool. Create a very slight angle at the wrist so that the whole hand slopes slightly downward. ADAM: Many swimmers feel that their hand should be very near the surface of the water in this position but to achieve that they have to drop their elbow or wrist. It is much better to go a touch deeper with the hand to get into a better catch set-up position, you won’t lose any stroke length from doing so but you’ll gain propulsion from a much more effective catch. This slight tipping of the wrist is important as it will help you initiate the catch itself. If you create too much of a downward angle you will feel your hand pull down towards the bottom of the pool. This is a bit like having your hand out of a car window, changing the angle

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
may find, however, that your arm still wants to drop down as the movement has become a habit. To help break this, use the mantra 1 - 2 - Stretch as you swim, the 1 and --- Page 107 Text --- 2 on non-breathing strokes and the Stretch when breathing to keep you focused on keeping the lead arm extended and offering you support. Developing Your Catch Step 2: Catch Mechanics The key to a great catch and pull through is to press the water backwards using the hand and forearm as a paddle. Pushing the water downward or to the side harms the catch and wastes a great deal of energy. To help you develop your catch we are going to use three main drills: Scull #1, Scull #2 and Doggy Paddle. Each will help you get a feel for pressing the water backwards in a bent elbow position. PAUL: Any time you struggle to perform a drill I think you should actually look at this as a positive: you’ve simply uncovered an area of your stroke technique or proprioception that needs work and you stand to benefit greatly from working on it! Sculling is a very valuable exercise, which helps to develop your ‘feel for the water’ – learning how the water should feel to you during the catch and how to time the stroke movements to create good propulsion. Most swimmers find sculling challenging at first but that’s OK, follow our pointers carefully and you will soon get better at it. --- Page 108 Text --- SCULL #1 Referring to the full drill description for Scull #1 in Appendix A, push off down the lap with a pull buoy between your legs and raise your head above the surface.

get better at it. --- Page 108 Text --- SCULL #1 Referring to the full drill description for Scull #1 in Appendix A, push off down the lap with a pull buoy between your legs and raise your head above the surface. Start sculling the water left and right in front of you changing the angle of your hand to keep a light water pressure on the palm. Make sure that your elbow is higher than your wrist and your wrist is higher than your fingertips. You may need to exaggerate this and move your hands a little lower in the water to make sure the palm is facing backwards. Scull #1 practices the position at the initial phase of the catch. Many swimming coaches talk about ‘reaching over a barrel’ or ‘reaching over and hugging a Swiss ball’ during the catch in the position you are in here. These can be very useful visualisations whilst performing Scull #1, try them out yourself. As your perform Scull #1, visualise reaching over a barrel or hugging a Swiss ball. This will help you develop the correct catch position. Sculling drills are always slow paced but a good sign that you are getting Scull #1 right is when your speed picks up noticeably and you feel your chest rising up a little in the water. Scull #1 and Overgliding A fascinating test you can try when performing Scull #1 is to move from your high elbow position into one where you drop the elbow and wrist so that your palm is facing forwards. If you are a bit of an Overglider you probably do this in your full stroke, dropping the wrist and showing the palm forwards. We call this position ‘putting on the brakes’. Overgliders tend to do this in their

the elbow and wrist so that your palm is facing forwards. If you are a bit of an Overglider you probably do this in your full stroke, dropping the wrist and showing the palm forwards. We call this position ‘putting on the brakes’. Overgliders tend to do this in their strokes without realising it as they strongly emphasise the extension forwards and add a glide to their strokes. You’ll notice when dropping the elbow and wrist in this position when sculling that you immediately stop moving forwards and may even start to move backwards! This goes to show how harmful Overgliding is for your stroke efficiency. You will also feel more water pressure on the palm of the hand in this position, which could make you think that you are getting a good catch in your full stroke. Of course, to be efficient you need to be pressing the water backwards, not forwards and away from you! --- Page 109 Text --- DOGGY PADDLE PAUL: Doggy Paddle drill is probably the oldest drill in the swimming world, it’s something I can recall doing at age six in the pool! It may be a very old drill but it’s great for developing your catch technique; in fact it’s the perfect drill to use if you have a tendency to catch or pull through with a very straight arm under the water. Referring to the description in Appendix A, perform the Doggy Paddle drill using a pull buoy starting off with your head above the surface. Imagine there’s a rope under the water, which you are moving over about 50cm or 2ft beneath the surface, and as you perform the drill aim to pull straight down that rope. Pull-through all the way to your hip and emphasise your body roll, the drill’s

head above the surface. Imagine there’s a rope under the water, which you are moving over about 50cm or 2ft beneath the surface, and as you perform the drill aim to pull straight down that rope. Pull-through all the way to your hip and emphasise your body roll, the drill’s mantra is ‘reach and roll’! Recovering the hands back under the water will feel strange at first, don’t worry too much about this, simply bring them through as smoothly as you can with a flat hand, fingers first. The focus of the drill should be in bending your elbow early in front of your head and getting over the top of the movement to press the water backwards using your hand and forearm as paddles. If you struggle with this experiment try moving a little deeper with the hands to help you get over the top of the stroke. Once you have got underway with Doggy Paddle you can drop your head down into the water and watch your movements in action. Keep it smooth and always in motion – either extending forwards, catching the water or pressing it backwards. No dead spots please and no showing the palm of the hand forwards! Transition into full-stroke swimming and continue the visualisation of pulling down a rope under your body, bend that elbow early in front of your head just like in the drill itself. You should find you pull through with a nice rhythm and tempo to the stroke. If you are an advanced swimmer you can get up quite a speed with Doggy Paddle! SCULL #2 Similar to Scull #1, this drill focuses on a slightly later point in the stroke as you are entering the pull phase under the head. It is ideal for swimmers who pull through

you are an advanced swimmer you can get up quite a speed with Doggy Paddle! SCULL #2 Similar to Scull #1, this drill focuses on a slightly later point in the stroke as you are entering the pull phase under the head. It is ideal for swimmers who pull through with a straight arm under the body as it emphasises a bent elbow position at this point of the stroke. During Scull #2, scull the water lightly by moving the hands slightly wider than the body and on the way in, nearly meeting in the middle. Keep your elbows in a fixed position and perform the sculling motion with a ‘mixing’ action from the elbows down. This is a harder drill than Scull #1 as it offers you less support to keep your head up in the water. When you transition into full-stroke swimming, focus on pulling through smoothly under the head with an elbow bend at approximately 100° to 120° --- Page 110 Text --- SMILEY FACE VISUALISATION The key to a successful catch and pull is to press the water back behind you through the whole arm stroke. Here is a simple way to visualise this as you swim: imagine someone’s drawn a smiley face on the palm of your hand and as you swim you’ve got to show that face back to the wall behind you at all times. This might sound slightly childish but it is a very effective way to focus you on a good pull- through technique. Imagine someone’s drawn a smiley face on the palm of your hand and as you swim show the face back to the wall behind you.

pull- through technique. Imagine someone’s drawn a smiley face on the palm of your hand and as you swim show the face back to the wall behind you. Integrating Catch Drills into a Set Sculling and Doggy Paddle drills are best followed immediately by full-stroke swimming to transfer the movements and ‘feel for the water’ into your full stroke. We recommend that you swim these drills for around 10–20 m and then transition into full- stroke swimming. For example: 4 × 100 m as 15 m Scull #1 transitioning into 85 m freestyle 8 × 50 m as 15 m Scull #2 transitioning into 35 m freestyle 2 × 200 m freestyle with the 0-25 m and 100-125 m Doggy Paddle 4 × 100 m as 10 m Scull #1 into 10 m Doggy Paddle into 80 m freestyle As you transition into freestyle in the above sets use the Smiley-Face Visualisation as you swim. Right Can Feel Wrong! A key element of a good catch and pull-through is to press the water back behind you at all times. Relative to you, the water is already moving in this direction as you swim through it, so in a sense you are simply helping the water on its way. However, a poor catch and pull-through presses down on the water or shows the palm forwards to push against the flow. Since water is so dense you will feel a significant pressure on the palm --- Page 111 Text --- of your hand as you do this and it is quite possible you are misinterpreting that pressure as a good catch. The irony is that as you improve your catch and start pressing the water backwards, you will feel less pressure on the palm as you are no longer changing the water’s

hand as you do this and it is quite possible you are misinterpreting that pressure as a good catch. The irony is that as you improve your catch and start pressing the water backwards, you will feel less pressure on the palm as you are no longer changing the water’s direction. As you improve your propulsive technique it’s easy to feel the reduced pressure on the palm and think ‘this can’t be right, a good catch should feel strong and solid’ and so return to your old stroke technique. This is one of the reasons why developing a good catch is so elusive for many swimmers. A good catch should allow you to feel a firm but not forced connection with the water. Fingers Spread or Together? Perhaps the most common question we are asked by swimmers about the catch phase of the stroke is how they should hold their fingers: should they be together or wide apart? For 95% of swimmers we recommend holding your fingers lightly together with no gaps between them. This is quite easy to coordinate and leaves you able to focus on the more important issues in your stroke technique. Elite swimmers do hold their fingers ever so slightly apart – enough to slip a few sheets of paper between but nothing more. This increases the effective surface area of their hands very slightly, however this is a very fine motor skill. Let the fingers move any wider and water starts slipping through the gaps and a lot of propulsion is lost. Holding your fingers lightly together will allow you to swim very quickly and efficiently without the risks of slipping by trying to hold them slightly apart. The Exit at the Rear of the Stroke The push phase at the back of the stroke

body rotates rhythmically with the arm stroke. With this in mind we’ll look at improving the timing of your stroke in the final part of this chapter. Developing Your Catch Step 3: Rhythm and Timing The Catch and Rhythm The catch and pull-through phases of the freestyle stroke have a huge knock-on effect on the stroke rate and rhythm of your stroke. A poor catch takes a long time to initiate as the water is pressed downward, to the side or even forwards. This slows down the stroke as the swimmer is forced to change the water’s direction. As you work on improving your catch technique and start to press the water backwards the catch phase takes less time as the water’s direction no longer needs to be changed. This lifts the overall tempo of the stroke and gives you a much greater sense of rhythm. PAUL: After following steps 1 and 2 of our catch development process you should already be feeling a much improved level of propulsion in your stroke, perhaps setting some personal bests or swimming much more easily for the same speed. That’s fantastic but to really integrate a better catch and pull-through into your stroke we need to pay attention to the rhythm and timing of your movements using some special drills. A swimmer with a good catch technique is constantly in motion, either extending forwards, catching the water or pressing it backwards. It’s important not to tear at the water by rushing the catch as this will cause the arm to slip through with little purchase. After the arm has finished extending, a good catch starts without delay as this gives the swimmer time to engage with the water in a high elbow position in front of the head. The drills in this section

as this will cause the arm to slip through with little purchase. After the arm has finished extending, a good catch starts without delay as this gives the swimmer time to engage with the water in a high elbow position in front of the head. The drills in this section (and The Doggy Paddle Drill from the catch mechanics section) are a great way to develop this fluid catch technique. --- Page 114 Text --- ADAM: If you like numbers (like me!) here’s a quick example to reinforce this point. Say you swim at 55 strokes per minute (SPM) at the moment with a poor catch technique. If you were to improve your catch such that you took just 0.2 seconds less to perform it (less than the blink of an eye!) then your stroke rate would lift to 60 SPM. This is a significant lift in stroke rate and one that would greatly benefit your speed and efficiency The good news here is that this wouldn’t feel harder to do as you would be working with the water rather than against it. For most swimmers it actually feels easier to swim at a higher tempo once they’ve improved their catch technique. Check out Chapter 15 for some recent research demonstrating this point. Overgliding and Catch Timing As we’ll see in Chapter 21, an Overglider is a type of swimmer who tries to swim with an extended glide phase at the front of their stroke. This adds a large dead spot or pause in their stroke timing. Overgliders are normally diligent swimmers who have worked hard on reducing their drag profile in the water but have become frustrated (and often a little confused) by why they are not swimming faster than they are. PAUL: Overgliders have become extremely common around

spot or pause in their stroke timing. Overgliders are normally diligent swimmers who have worked hard on reducing their drag profile in the water but have become frustrated (and often a little confused) by why they are not swimming faster than they are. PAUL: Overgliders have become extremely common around the world as many coaching programmes actively encourage adding a deliberate pause-and-glide into the stroke, often saying the swimmer should be ‘patient’ with their catch to encourage the pause before starting it. As we’ll discuss in Chapter 15 (Science of Swimming) and Chapter 17 (Swim Types), teaching swimmers to over-glide is something that myself and the other Swim Smooth coaches fundamentally disagree with as it stops swimmers reaching their true potential in the water. The overall timing between an Overglider and an elite swimmer is similar but the elite swimmer does not actually pause as they extend forwards – they are constantly in motion either entering the water, extending forwards or catching the water. By introducing a dead spot to their stroke the Overglider is then forced to hurry their catch to restart their stroke again. This hurried catch makes it very hard to engage with the water without slipping through it. This is the main difference between an Overglider’s stroke and a Smooth’s stroke (Chapter 23) – other than the fact that the Smooth swims at twice the speed! If you are an Overglider the path to improving your swimming is to remove the dead spot from your stroke by developing an improved catch technique. This will give you a more fluid stroke and will also lift your stroke rate slightly, giving your swimming a renewed sense of rhythm. --- Page 115 Text --- UNCO DRILL The Unco drill is described fully in Appendix A and is a one-arm

by developing an improved catch technique. This will give you a more fluid stroke and will also lift your stroke rate slightly, giving your swimming a renewed sense of rhythm. --- Page 115 Text --- UNCO DRILL The Unco drill is described fully in Appendix A and is a one-arm drill performed with the inactive arm resting by the swimmer’s side. Using fins is essential to propel you through the water as the active arm recovers over the top. Breathe on every stroke away from the stroking arm. The key to Unco is to emphasise your body rotation, particularly thinking about the shoulder of your inactive arm and dipping it down low into the water as the active arm recovers over the surface. A good mantra for the drill is ‘breathe and dip, breathe and dip . . .’ to help you remember to breathe away from the stroking arm and emphasise dipping the inactive shoulder and hip. PAUL: Australians are fond of shortening words and Unco is Aussie slang for uncoordinated! It’s quite an advanced drill and you may struggle with coordinating it at first, particularly if your stroke timing needs some work. The irony is that when you get this drill right it is anything but uncoordinated as it forces you to time your stroke to your body rotation without the assistance of the recovering arm. The transition to full-stroke swimming is important as you will feel an immediate benefit to your stroke’s timing. We suggest you swim sets of Unco as 100 m continuously: 25 m left arm Unco (breathing to the right) 25 m freestyle (only breathing to the right) 25 m right arm Unco (breathing to the left) 25 m freestyle (only breathing to the left) As you transition into the freestyle portions you should

sets of Unco as 100 m continuously: 25 m left arm Unco (breathing to the right) 25 m freestyle (only breathing to the right) 25 m right arm Unco (breathing to the left) 25 m freestyle (only breathing to the left) As you transition into the freestyle portions you should feel a nice easy rhythm to your stroke. ADAM: In Chapter 10 we discussed how good swimming posture helps connect the arm stroke to the body, allowing your body rotation to assist in driving the stroke. To maximise this transfer of power, the swimmer also needs good timing of the arm stroke in relation to the body roll. As a former Overglider with poor timing Unco is personally my favourite drill, it’s fantastic for tuning up the timing of my stroke. WATERPOLO DRILL Head-up Waterpolo swimming is a great drill to help upper-intermediate and advanced level swimmers to improve the rhythm of their stroke. It is especially effective for removing dead spots from stroke timing as it is almost impossible to swim head-up with a long pause in the stroke! As described in Appendix A, the key to the drill is to swim it quickly at near sprint pace to really focus you on a fast stroke rate. Perform it with your chin on the surface for just 25 m at a time. If you struggle to complete the drill well try it with fins to give you more lift and drive. Perform the drill as 4 × 25 m Waterpolo with about 15 seconds rest between each 25 m. Immediately transition into 100 m of steady paced swimming focusing on an easy rhythm to the stroke. PULL BUOY AND BANDS Swimming with a pull buoy between your legs and a rubber band around your ankles is a simple way

resultant increase in stroke rate. On the left-hand side we see the stroke rate of the swimmers and the length of their dead spot in seconds. The slight Overglider has a dead spot or overglide lasting around 0.3 seconds, the classic Overglider around 0.5 seconds and the extreme Overglider a full second! In comparison a classic Smooth swimmer would have around 0.1–0.15 seconds between one stroke finishing at the rear and the next one starting at the front. A refined Swinger would have zero delay or even an overlap, starting the stroke at the front before the stroke at the rear finishes. In the right-hand column we show a target reduction in dead spot, this is the initial reduction we might aim for when working with this swimmer in a one-to-one coaching situation. In the far right-hand column we calculate the resultant stroke rate if nothing else changes in the stroke but the shortening of the dead spot. We can see that each of the swimmers gains between five and seven strokes per minute by reducing the dead spot in their strokes alone, a very noticeable improvement which you will feel as a real increase in your stroke rhythm. Dropping the wrist and elbow and pushing forwards adds a big pause to the stroke, lowering your stroke rate. ADAM: If you own a Wetronome or a Finis Tempo Trainer Pro, go through the process of improving your catch technique and reducing the dead spot in your stroke. Then use the beeper to return to your old stroke rate – it is amazing how slow it will feel. When trying this, rehabilitated Overgliders can’t believe how they ever swam at such a slow rhythm! --- OCR from Page 121 Image 1 --- before after stroke rate (strokes = length of dead

Pro and adjust it up or down until it feels about normal for you. The second is to have a friend or coach measure your stroke rate using a specialist stop watch such as the Finis 3X-100 M; if you are a coach yourself one of these watches is a great investment in your coaching. The third way is to have a friend use a normal stop watch and time how long you take to perform ten strokes (counting both arms), then divide 600 by that number. So if you take 12 seconds for 10 strokes, 600 / 12 = 50 strokes per minute. The Swim Smooth Stroke Rate Chart A useful tool to help you assess your stroke rate is our stroke rate chart, shown in Figure 14.13. The chart shows swimmer speed against stroke rate – it covers the whole range of swimmers from beginners up to elite distance swimmers. The chart was developed from analysing hundreds of swimmers’ strokes in comparison to their speed and stroke rate. FIGURE 14.13 The Swim Smooth Stroke Rate Chart. --- Page 123 Text --- The chart contains three zones: the first is the blue zone, which shows where the swimmer’s stroke rate is too low – normally the result of an overglide in their stroke timing. The second zone is the red zone where a swimmer is fighting the water, resulting in a short fast stroke. The white zone is the ‘sweet spot’ indicating a good trade-off between stroke length and rate. Use the chart to assess your swimming and decide how you need to progress things. You can find an interactive version of the chart on our website at www.swimsmooth.com/strokerate.

Unfortunately by searching for a term such as ‘swimming technique’ on Google you will find lots of contradictory advice in videos and on discussion forums, some of which is very out of date and badly advised for the majority of swimmers. ADAM: This section is a little more technical than the rest of the book as we explain the background behind our coaching methods from a scientific perspective. If you enjoy a little technical discussion and analysis then you will find this fascinating but don’t worry if you don’t – you can safely skip this chapter, it won’t harm your swimming to do so. In this section we are going to take a close look at the concept of efficiency in swimming, why it is important to be an efficient swimmer and how different aspects of your stroke affect it. We are also going to clear up many of those misconceptions from the internet and other sources along the way. Elite swimmer Rhys Mainstone has a very efficient and fast stroke which lets him swim around 1:10 / 100 m at a steady pace. How can he move so quickly? Why Efficiency is So Important Elite pool and open water swimmers have a great stroke technique, which is the dominant reason why they move so quickly through the water. In fact, an elite swimmer’s stroke is so effective that when swimming at an easy pace they move more --- Page 125 Text --- quickly than most ‘normal’ swimmers can sprint – amazing! What’s their secret? It comes down to the efficiency of their strokes. How fast you move through the water is down to a combination of the efficiency of your

at an easy pace they move more --- Page 125 Text --- quickly than most ‘normal’ swimmers can sprint – amazing! What’s their secret? It comes down to the efficiency of their strokes. How fast you move through the water is down to a combination of the efficiency of your stroke and how hard you are working. Let’s look at this on an ‘efficiency plot’ as shown in Figure 15.14. On the x axis we will put your physical effort (we could measure this as oxygen uptake or perhaps heart rate) and on the y axis your speed. Any given swimmer with a fixed level of efficiency will make a distinct curve on the graph. The relationship between effort and speed is fixed for the swimmer; as you increase your effort you move more quickly but it’s a case of diminishing returns as drag of the water increases quickly, creating the curved line. FIGURE 15.14 Efficiency plot for a swimmer of fixed efficiency1. Now let’s introduce two other swimmers, one who is less efficient and one who is more, as shown in Figure 15.15. FIGURE 15.15 Efficiency plot of three swimmers of wide ranging ability. Beginner, intermediate and elite swimmers have increasing levels of fitness respectively and so can sustain higher work rates. --- OCR from Page 125 Image 1 --- Swimming speed eDparrnmer work pote: ‘affort’ --- Page 126 Text --- Our elite swimmer shown with the green line has superior stroke technique whilst the beginner swimmer shown by the red line has a relatively poor stroke.

the red line has a relatively poor stroke. Notice how the efficiency effect works – it moves the whole line up and down, i.e. efficiency benefits you at all speeds whether going at an easy pace, moderate or hard. This is an interesting insight all by itself as it tells us that if you are efficient you should also be pretty fast. You cannot be a ‘slow but efficient swimmer’ as some people believe — really there is no such thing. If we had two different swimmers with the same stroke efficiency then their lines would be over the top of each other. In a race the fitter swimmer would win as they could sustain a higher level of effort but if they had the same fitness they would swim at the same speed. ADAM: Last year I was filming Olympic swimmer Jono Van Hazel and he was zooming up and down the pool very quickly with his super efficient stroke. As an experiment I asked him to slow down from the speed he was doing, around 1:10 /100 m down to 1:40 /100 m pace. The fascinating thing was that he actually couldn’t swim that speed without disrupting his stroke technique. He had to change his stroke and become less efficient by adding a pause and glide to the stroke. In terms of our efficiency graph, he couldn’t slow down enough just by lowering his effort, he had to hurt his stroke technique and so jump down to one of the lower efficiency lines to swim ‘as slowly’ as 1:40 per 100 m!

PAUL: Don’t worry if you’re struggling to understand this graph and the curved lines, this is the most technical we’re going to get in this book! The important message to take away from this section is that a good stroke technique makes you an efficient swimmer and that’s what we should all be aiming for as it will make your swimming fast and feel much easier too. Efficiency and the Three Keys So if swimming efficiency is so important, does that mean that you should focus on stroke technique development in the pool and nothing else in your swimming preparation? Unfortunately not, for two reasons: --- OCR from Page 126 Image 1 --- Swimming speed \ eMirmrumer werk rate: ‘afford increasing swimming efficiency — alite swimmer — intermediate swimmer — beginner swimmer --- Page 127 Text --- 1. As you fatigue you cannot sustain a good stroke technique, the stroke becomes shorter as you tire because you cannot finish the back of the stroke properly. This shorter stroke reduces your body roll and so the arms start to carry lower over the surface giving you that feeling of fighting the water or that your stroke is ‘falling apart’. For swimmers with poor fitness this deterioration in efficiency can happen very quickly after only 100 m or 200 m of swimming. To be an efficient swimmer you need to have good swim-specific fitness to sustain good stroke technique. 2. As we shall discuss in Chapter 33, your stroke efficiency is highly dependent on the water conditions you are swimming in. A longer stroke style suffers a large drop in efficiency in open water as it is more prone to being stalled by small waves and chop, after

technique. 2. As we shall discuss in Chapter 33, your stroke efficiency is highly dependent on the water conditions you are swimming in. A longer stroke style suffers a large drop in efficiency in open water as it is more prone to being stalled by small waves and chop, after which the swimmer needs to put in additional effort to accelerate again. To race well in open water it’s necessary to develop a technique that suits that environment and not simply focus on an efficient pool stroke. To be an efficient swimmer you need to have a stroke that is efficient in your race environment. Navigation and drafting skills are also critical for racing well in open water and need to be given a portion of your training time too. From the perspective of our efficiency graphs in Figures 15.14 and 15.15, the early onset of fatigue from poor fitness or using a stroke not suited to open water will drop you down onto a lower line. This is the fundamental understanding behind our ‘Three Keys’, to be an efficient and fast swimmer you need: Key 1: An efficient stroke technique with low drag and high propulsion levels. Key 2: Good fitness levels to sustain your swimming effort with good stroke technique. Key 3: Good open water skills, to adapt your stroke to the open water. Efficiency and Low Drag The term ‘efficiency’ is very commonly discussed by swimmers and triathletes in relation to swimming and most understand that to be a good swimmer you need an efficient stroke technique. However, many swimmers define an efficient stroke to be one that has low levels of drag; whilst this is partly the case it is a long way from the full story and trying to lower their drag at all costs

be a good swimmer you need an efficient stroke technique. However, many swimmers define an efficient stroke to be one that has low levels of drag; whilst this is partly the case it is a long way from the full story and trying to lower their drag at all costs has led many swimmers down a blind alley with their stroke technique. An efficient freestyle stroke is one that has both low levels of drag and high levels of propulsion. Actually, to be strictly correct we mean high levels of propulsive efficiency because any swimmer can generate more propulsion by lifting their work rate but that doesn’t make them more efficient. What we are really interested in is how much forward propulsion you create given how hard you are working physically: if we can increase that propulsive efficiency you will create lots of propulsion from low levels of physical effort and this will lift your overall efficiency dramatically. We could say that: overall efficiency = drag profile × propulsive efficiency --- Page 128 Text --- Let’s consider both of these areas: Low drag is very important to a good stroke technique because water is so dense, 800 times denser than air in fact. Any object moving through water creates drag, which tries to slow it down, but the shape and profile of the object has a large effect on how much drag is created by the water. As a swimmer we are looking to be as streamlined as possible in order to slip easily through it. This means keeping all elements of your stroke as straight and aligned as possible and also keeping your body position (chest- hips-ankles) as horizontal and high in the water as possible. Propulsive efficiency is about creating as much forward propulsion as possible given how

order to slip easily through it. This means keeping all elements of your stroke as straight and aligned as possible and also keeping your body position (chest- hips-ankles) as horizontal and high in the water as possible. Propulsive efficiency is about creating as much forward propulsion as possible given how hard you are working. As discussed earlier in Chapter 9, as an adult swimmer you are aiming to generate most of your propulsion from your arm stroke as it’s much more efficient than your leg kick, i.e. for any level of physical effort, you create more propulsion with your arm stroke than you would with your kick. As we saw in Chapter 13, the key to developing good upper-body propulsion is to press the water backwards with good timing, thus sending you forwards. A poor stroke with poor propulsive efficiency pushes the water to the side, downward or even forwards – this is very hard work and results in much less propulsion. Which is more important, low drag or good propulsion? Neither, they are in fact equally important. If you made a 10% reduction in your drag you would gain the same in overall speed and efficiency as a 10% improvement in propulsive efficiency. In a nutshell, you cannot be a strong swimmer without low drag and good propulsion so you need to work on both areas of your stroke technique. Which should you develop first? Generally speaking we recommend you develop both at the same time but some swimmers already have low drag and need to work more on their propulsion as a priority and vice versa. In the Swim Types section in Chapters 17 to 23 we’ll give you some specific advice on this for your individual swimming. ADAM: A good reason to work on your propulsive technique,

already have low drag and need to work more on their propulsion as a priority and vice versa. In the Swim Types section in Chapters 17 to 23 we’ll give you some specific advice on this for your individual swimming. ADAM: A good reason to work on your propulsive technique, even as a novice swimmer, is that a poor technique can actually harm your body position and create drag. Many swimmers overly focusing on drag reduction introduce knock-on problems into their stroke technique, which actually increase drag again. There’s no need to go to the extremes when you develop your swimming, keep a mix of stroke work focusing on propulsion and lowering drag and you’ll be on the best path to developing a very efficient stroke. Stroke Length vs. Stroke Rate The speed at which you move through the water is a combination of the length of your stroke (metres) and the rate of your stroke (strokes per minute): swimming speed = stroke length × stroke rate In cycling terms, this is equivalent to the gear and cadence you are using – increase either and you move more quickly. To become faster you need to either increase your stroke length or stroke rate, or both. How you should go about doing this is a controversial area of swimming coaching. As we shall see on the next page, Swim --- Page 129 Text --- Smooth strongly believe that you need to maintain the right trade-off between these two elements to be a fast and efficient swimmer. The exact balance you strike between the two will depend on your build, experience, skill level and natural stroke style. Efficiency and Stroke Length In the early 1990s a movement developed in swimming promoting the idea that all swimmers should look to maximise the length

a fast and efficient swimmer. The exact balance you strike between the two will depend on your build, experience, skill level and natural stroke style. Efficiency and Stroke Length In the early 1990s a movement developed in swimming promoting the idea that all swimmers should look to maximise the length of their strokes. This was based on the following observations at the time: 1. Olympic champions often (but not always) have long strokes, taking fewer strokes per length than ‘normal’ swimmers. For instance, freestyle great Alex Popov taking around 31 strokes per 50 m. 2. Slow inefficient swimmers who fight the water have shorter strokes and take more strokes per length than more capable swimmers. The conclusion drawn was that to be efficient you need a long stroke and this should be a priority for all swimmers to develop, regardless of whether they were pool or open water swimmers. Swimmers were taught to lengthen out their strokes as much as possible and try and glide down the pool, with the lead hand held out for an extended time creating a distinct pause between strokes. At Swim Smooth we call this style of stroke ‘Overgliding’. Unfortunately this approach was a very over-simplified view of swimming technique and did not take into account the true facts: 1. Many other Olympic champions use a shorter faster stroke very effectively if it suits their natural style. For instance Janet Evans and Laure Manadou taking around 50 strokes per 50 m. These swimmers are examples of the refined Swinger style (see Chapter 22). 2. Great swimmers that were observed with long strokes were not achieving their stroke length through gliding, they were achieving it through low drag and great propulsion (see below). Video analysis of these swimmers shows that the gap between one stroke finishing

of the refined Swinger style (see Chapter 22). 2. Great swimmers that were observed with long strokes were not achieving their stroke length through gliding, they were achieving it through low drag and great propulsion (see below). Video analysis of these swimmers shows that the gap between one stroke finishing at the rear and the next starting at the front is between 0 and 0.15 seconds [2]. For Overgliders with an artificial glide, this gap is typically 0.5 to 1.0 seconds. 3. Elite open water swimmers and triathletes use a shorter faster stroke style that helps them punch through disturbed water from other swimmers in close proximity. Our key message here is that different styles of stroke suit different swimmers – a long stroke may suit you and you will be very efficient performing it, or a slightly shorter punchier style may be more efficient for you. Take an individual approach to your swimming and you stand a much greater chance of swimming success. Making a Stroke Longer There are three ways to make a stroke longer: --- Page 130 Text --- 1. Reduce drag so that you slip through the water more easily. 2. Increase propulsion so that each stroke pushes you further. 3. Introduce an extended glide to elongate each stroke. The first two are excellent ways to lengthen your stroke – they are the result of good stroke technique having low drag and high levels of propulsive efficiency, which will make you more efficient. The problem with the last way, gliding, is that it is an artificial way to lengthen the stroke and does not make you more efficient for three major reasons: 1. Whilst overgliding you decelerate in the water and then have to re-accelerate on the next stroke, which is hard work. 2. This is

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
quicker with the same number of strokes taken or by taking fewer strokes at the same speed. The idea being to use a longer stroke and therefore become more efficient. If you have been swimming for a while yourself you have probably tried this test at some point. At Swim Smooth we dislike using Swim-Golf tests because they encourage swimmers to add glide to their strokes and to kick hard to artificially lengthen them. They also encourage swimmers to simply increase their effort by pushing harder on every stroke to take them further on each stroke. PAUL: When I am coaching I very rarely encourage swimmers to count their strokes or perform Swim-Golf tests. To create a more efficient stroke we need to improve a swimmer’s technique by lowering their drag or increasing their propulsive efficiency. The end result is a longer stroke without the swimmer consciously chasing it. Putting the cart before the horse and making the objective a long stroke only encourages swimmers to over-glide and so ironically become less, not more, efficient. Stroke Length and Stroke Style As we will discover in the Swim Types section of this book, there are two distinct styles of stroke used by elite swimmers to great effect. The first is the ‘Smooth’ style which is what most of us think of as an efficient stroke, being long and silky smooth but still – vitally – maintaining good stroke rhythm. The second is the ‘Refined Swinger’ style, which is a shorter more punchy style of stroke with a higher stroke rate. Both of these styles are very efficient. In fact the longer-smoother style tends to be used by sprinters and middle distance athletes whilst the Swinger style is used predominantly by distance swimmers from 800 m and up, especially in the open

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
punchy style of stroke with a higher stroke rate. Both of these styles are very efficient. In fact the longer-smoother style tends to be used by sprinters and middle distance athletes whilst the Swinger style is used predominantly by distance swimmers from 800 m and up, especially in the open water. This is the opposite of what most swimmers would think, as they would consider the longer stroke more efficient and therefore more suited to distance swimming. This simply highlights that the refined-Swinger style has been misunderstood (and under- appreciated!) by swimmers and coaches for so long; it is in fact an extremely efficient stroke style and the superior style in open water. Choosing the Right Trade-Off Between Stroke Length and Stroke Rate So should you chase a particular stroke count per length? Probably not – it rarely helps to do so. Instead, use the Stroke Technique sections of this book (Key 1) to reduce your drag, increase your propulsion and improve your stroke rhythm. The end result will be --- Page 132 Text --- the right stroke length for your given build, height, arm length, experience level and natural style. Once you have developed your stroke you can then refine things a little further using the Stroke Rate Ramp test, which we described at the end of Chapter 13. This will help you determine the right stroke rate for you where all the elements of your stroke ‘click’ together. If you feel that you need to increase or decrease your stroke rate, refer to Chapter 14 where we took a close look at the process of doing so. References 1. Toussaint, H. M. 2010.

Note 1 These efficiency plots are based on the 2.0–2.2 power relationship between velocity and drag at sub 1.4 m / s swimming speed [1]. Above this speed drag increases even more rapidly as wave drag becomes dominant [1]. The plots assume a constant propulsive efficiency for each swimmer across their effort range. In practise propulsive efficiency is known to increase with effort level, which will slightly steepen the relationships shown on the plots. To date no research has quantified this increase and so it is assumed fixed for the purposes of this analysis. --- Page 133 Text --- CHAPTER 16 Performing Your Own Video Analysis Session PAUL: Isn’t technology wonderful? I first started using a Sony digital video camera back in 1997 as an easy way to communicate with the swimmer what they were doing in the water and how they might improve their stroke technique. Being able to see what they were doing whilst I simultaneously analysed their stroke had a profound benefit that simple poolside demonstrations could never replicate. I vividly recall as a 12-year-old my squad coach telling me that he would bring his huge 1980s Betacam system down to the pool to film me and show me how I might refine my stroke but alas this never happened. However, the idea was sown and as soon as I

vividly recall as a 12-year-old my squad coach telling me that he would bring his huge 1980s Betacam system down to the pool to film me and show me how I might refine my stroke but alas this never happened. However, the idea was sown and as soon as I commenced my Sport and Exercise Science degree course, I was keen to combine my sports biomechanics studies with my love for swimming and coaching through the use of video analysis. Over the last 14 years I have used a vast range of video recording equipment, computer hardware and analysis software to analyse the strokes of thousands of swimmers around the world but never has it been so easy and relatively inexpensive for you to do this yourself. We are hoping that you will combine the new knowledge gained from this book with the tools you already might have at hand to video yourself swimming and see what you are doing in the water. After identifying what you need to do to improve your stroke you can then select the right Swim Type process to follow and take some big strides forward in your technique. Our best advice is to seek expert tuition from a good coach but if cost, time and geographical issues prevent you from doing so, conducting your own analysis is the next best thing and will help you avoid the statement that we hear most often from swimmers: ‘I know what I should be doing but I don’t know what I’m actually doing or how to improve it!’ Please note: in most pools around the world strict regulations make it is essential to have prior permission to use any sort of recording equipment.

Overgliders, this is a very powerful image to demonstrate how your catch-up style (6) can lead you to overglide and apply the brakes at the front of your stroke (7). Given that many true Overgliders are intentionally targeting a slow stroke rate, you can see here how applying the brakes would slow your stroke rate down – for this reason putting on the brakes and Overgliding are strongly linked. Use the process in Chapter 13 to develop a better catch technique and your stroke rate will naturally lift, returning a nice sense of rhythm to your stroke. --- Page 139 Text --- The Front View (8) shows parts of the catch and pull-through in more detail. If you are a more advanced swimmer you may be wondering how you can improve your catch – this angle will give you a prime insight into that. What is the angle of your elbow bend during the pull-through? Is it greater than 140° or less than 90°? If so your catch probably needs some refining (8). Many swimmers will press down with a straight arm rather than bending the elbow and pressing backwards. You are also looking to examine the amount of bubbles coming off the arms too. If you fight the water you will see a sleeve of bubbles compared to someone with an efficient stroke having a clean pull-through. Other flaws to watch out for from this angle are crossing over of the centre line under the body (9) and also whether you are holding your breathing underwater – we should see a constant stream of bubbles exiting from either your nose or mouth. --- Page 140 Text --- PAUL: One word of caution when performing your own video analysis: don’t become so pedantic about your stroke that you invoke ‘paralysis

Rome wasn’t built in a day, so after breaking your stroke down work on a single aspect at a time, this will be much more productive than trying to change everything at once.

Should We All Swim The Same? --- Page 141 Text --- CHAPTER 17 The Swim Types System Coaching the Swimmer, Not the Stroke Since Swim Smooth’s creation in 2004, we’ve talked a lot about the need for an individual approach in swimming; how swimmers needed to work on different aspects of their technique based on their age, height, experience, gender and even personality. In contrast to this, many traditional swimming programmes treat everyone the same and have them repeat the same visualisations and drills constantly with one ideal stroke in mind. This one-dimensional approach has several major disadvantages: Ceinwen is 1.60 m tall and Andy is 2.00 m. Should these two swimmers adopt the same stroke style? The vision of a perfect stroke may not suit the swimmer’s physical attributes e.g. height, strength, gender, natural buoyancy. The starting point of the swimmer is ignored and so the coaching is never tailored to their individual needs. As a consequence their rate of progress is dramatically slowed or stops completely. --- Page 142 Text --- No account is taken of

physical attributes e.g. height, strength, gender, natural buoyancy. The starting point of the swimmer is ignored and so the coaching is never tailored to their individual needs. As a consequence their rate of progress is dramatically slowed or stops completely. --- Page 142 Text --- No account is taken of the environment in which the swimmer is racing and the importance of tailoring the swimmer’s stroke technique to those conditions. e.g. pool versus open water and wetsuit versus non-wetsuit swimming. Our Swim Types system is a way of taking a much more individual approach to your swimming: Swim Types gives you the option of two ideal stroke styles to head towards, one of which will suit your physical make-up and personality. Your current stroke technique is recognised and a tailored development path is set for you, allowing you to take rapid steps forward. The system shows you how differing styles suit different race environments and helps you develop your stroke to excel in those conditions. This is not just about maximum performance, the right stroke style will make things much more comfortable and enjoyable too. Swim Types has been used internally by Swim Smooth coaches since 2008 but since the website www.swimtypes.com was launched in 2010, it has been used directly by swimmers with hundreds of thousands of followers from around the world visiting the site and using the system.

the thinking behind the system and how it was created: --- Page 143 Text --- PAUL: Coming from a competitive swimming background as a kid growing up in the UK, I always found it fascinating to see how different body types and builds gravitated towards each of the four competitive strokes – butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle. The tallest swimmers with great hip flexibility tended to excel at breaststroke; the tall, muscular swimmers with great kicks were strong in the freestyle and backstroke sprint events; and the shorter, stockier swimmers with good upper-body flexibility tended to be good at butterfly. Being a little vertically challenged myself (compared to some of my giant-like rivals!) my best events were the 100 m and 200 m butterfly and the longer distance freestyle events. I could not seem to sprint like the other guys no matter how much speed work I put in but ask me to move along at a moderately fast pace and maintain this for repetition after repetition, well that I could do! Still, there were no prizes for being good at training or having a good work ethic – all that counted was who was first to the touch pads. Proudly representing Bridlington Swimming Club aged 9 (centre) I couldn’t change my growth rate or the size of my feet but swimming would have been a lot less frustrating had I been shown how genetics potentially predisposed me to one stroke or distance of event over another. I certainly wouldn’t have kept trying to become a super-quick 50 m freestyle specialist against my 1.9 m / 6′ 4″ rivals! What’s more, the recommended stroke style and technique that worked for these guys just didn’t seem to work for me. As a junior I was told by my coaches that my

have kept trying to become a super-quick 50 m freestyle specialist against my 1.9 m / 6′ 4″ rivals! What’s more, the recommended stroke style and technique that worked for these guys just didn’t seem to work for me. As a junior I was told by my coaches that my stroke didn’t look that pretty and I was often affectionately known as ‘Steam Boat Willie’ by my friends because of my high stroke rate and a punchy style. Unfortunately, open water swimming wasn’t very popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s and at 10 or 11 years of age, very rarely would we be encouraged to swim more than 400 m freestyle at a meet. This is a shame given what we now know about the differences in swimming style and suitability towards different environments and distances. Unfortunately I didn’t progress beyond county (state) representative level in the pool. However I did switch to triathlon at the age of 16 and instantly felt at home, revelling in the new open water environment with my aerobic engine and high revving stroke. I was much more suited to the longer distances in rougher water than to the 50 m or 100 m dash in the pool, and went on to represent Great Britain in triathlon as a Junior and Under-23 between the years of 1997 and 2001. Being one of the fastest swimmers in the field was fantastic and I was thankful for both my swimming background and for being persistent enough to stick with the sport when many of my fellow swimmers ‘retired’ in their mid-teens.

O”dIW€6 --- Page 145 Text --- When you are fortunate enough to work full-time with thousands of swimmers of varying ability you start to notice trends in the way people move in the water. Being of an inquisitive and scientific mind, I started cross- referencing some of the most major faults within people’s strokes against their body-type, build, gender and swimming background. Was there any link between a swimmer’s inefficiency in the water and their physical make-up? Was I giving similar instruction to certain types of swimmers but giving differing advice to others – even if this advice seemed to contradict what I was telling the first group? The world view within swimming at this time was that everyone should be taught to fit a single mould, irrespective of physical build or background. One of the strongest notions was that if you could make your stroke as long as is physically possible by reducing the number of strokes you took per lap, then you’d supposedly become ever more efficient. But how long is long, and is this the same number of strokes for everyone irrespective of their height and arm length? Aiming for less than 40 strokes per 50 m seemed to be the hallowed goal of swimmers and coaches; after all Ian Thorpe and Alexander Popov were reputedly taking fewer strokes than any of their contemporaries and looked so graceful in the process. Swimmers would be taught to do endless technique sets in the pool trying to reduce the number of strokes taken per length with those producing the lowest numbers being praised and those over the average being rejected as failing to be efficient, despite how

looked so graceful in the process. Swimmers would be taught to do endless technique sets in the pool trying to reduce the number of strokes taken per length with those producing the lowest numbers being praised and those over the average being rejected as failing to be efficient, despite how fast they might have been swimming in races. ON SHELLEY TAYLOR-SMITH COACH GRAEME CARROLL: Shelley’s body shape and swimming technique was forged to be ‘the perfect open water swimmer’. I likened her to a Ferrari: built to do the distance at speed. Shelley was able to keep a steady rate of 40–45 [80–90 SPM] in all types of conditions, rough and smooth waters, and varying temperatures. What sums it up best is Shelley coming to me one day in her late 30s when she was still ranked world number one woman, wanting to change her body (in particular her big shoulders) to be more feminine. I replied ‘that body is the body of a World Champion and you can mess with it anyway you want when you retire but right now nothing is broken, so we’re not changing a thing!’ Steven Munatones, Founder www.openwaterswimming.com and former USA Open Water Swimming Team Coach: ‘Shelley Taylor-Smith’s legacy – in which she beat her male competitors so consistently – led to the international governing body to create equal prize money for both men and women in the sport. Shelley’s greatest achievement will live on throughout the waterways of the world.’ Most coaches and theoreticians seemed to be looking past those swimmers excelling in events longer than 400 m in the pool and open water when they wrote their manuals on how all of us should aim to swim. Enter Shelley Taylor-Smith, seven times World Cup marathon swimming champion and open water specialist from

theoreticians seemed to be looking past those swimmers excelling in events longer than 400 m in the pool and open water when they wrote their manuals on how all of us should aim to swim. Enter Shelley Taylor-Smith, seven times World Cup marathon swimming champion and open water specialist from Perth. In 1991 Shelley was ranked number one in the world for women and men in marathon swimming events and in the same year she won the 25 km open water event at the World Aquatics Championships in the Swan River in Perth. In no other endurance sporting event would a woman out-perform the men and yet here was Shelley doing just that, breaking all the rules. Not only was Shelley breaking the gender rules, she was also breaking the stroke rules too! At 1.65 m / 5′ 5″ Shelley wasn’t able to swim with less than 40 strokes per 50 m in the pool as most of the guys would do, instead she would take around 52 strokes. Shelley would generate her speed by matching this stroke length with a very fast stroke rate around 90 strokes per minute. For many such a high stroke rate with so many strokes per length would have been laughed off as inefficient but here was one of the world’s best ever distance swimmers doing just that, winning world championship after world championship and often beating all the men in the process. Shelley had developed and refined a stroke which was the most optimal style for her, as did Olympic Champion Janet Evans before her and Laure Manadou, David Davies and Lotte Friis (all Olympic Medallists) have done since. Meeting Shelley and seeing her in action was mind-blowing and I was seeing more and more that the consensus in swimming was wrong and

optimal style for her, as did Olympic Champion Janet Evans before her and Laure Manadou, David Davies and Lotte Friis (all Olympic Medallists) have done since. Meeting Shelley and seeing her in action was mind-blowing and I was seeing more and more that the consensus in swimming was wrong and there was more than one type of fast and efficient freestyle stroke. Whilst everything in the printed media and online at this time was still saying ‘longer strokes are always better’, in practice I was finding that whilst this would work for some, for others this advice was proving totally detrimental if they simply didn’t have the physical height and strength to make it work for them. In pursuing a very long stroke, these swimmers were creating as many problems in their technique as they were solving. I coined the phrase ‘Overglider’ as far back as 2004 after seeing so many swimmers introducing a --- Page 146 Text --- long glide to their stroke to try and lengthen it out as much as possible. These swimmers had pretty good alignment and body position but were stuck on a performance plateau whilst in pursuit of an ever-longer stroke. With my sports-science background I respect the fact that research and evidence was needed to test hypothesis and the evidence was stacking up here against the ‘longer is more efficient’ world view. Thinking back to my own swimming, a long stroke would have been great for the 1.9 m tall giants with powerful kicks to push them through the gap between strokes but I was neither tall nor was I very good at kick! Nor were many of the swimmers that I was coaching and most were training for open water swimming and triathlon where the conditions are much bumpier from swimming in

to put this into practice. I could personally identify with another group of swimmers who had a strong swimming background but had developed a complex about the tidiness of their strokes and inability to kick (and sprint!). It was very obvious to me that all these types of swimmer should be developed and worked with differently. If we could classify them and provide each ‘Swim Type’ with their own individual pathway for developing their strokes then all swimmers would develop at an optimal rate and into a style of stroke best suited to their makeup. We would be able to move away from a cookie-cutter programme that only works for the lucky few. Working with the other Swim Smooth coaches and sharing experiences and ideas, I formulated this into the full Swim Types system in 2007–08. We used and refined the system and stroke correction processes for a further two years before launching it to the world on www.swimtypes.com in June 2010. I was very excited about the potential of Swim Types but also aware that the system needed to be extremely well thought through and as fool-proof as possible before launching it. After developing the stroke-style aspect of Swim Types, the area that fascinated me most was how each of the types tended to have a distinct personality. As a coach, one of the most important things I have learned over the last 15 years is that communication and the way you give direction to an athlete is just as important as what you actually say. I have met a wide range of swimmers over the years: some are very direct and want straight-forward answers with no ‘fluff’, some crave a detailed scientific explanation, some seek minimal guidance but want assistance with motivation and others respond best to a

as important as what you actually say. I have met a wide range of swimmers over the years: some are very direct and want straight-forward answers with no ‘fluff’, some crave a detailed scientific explanation, some seek minimal guidance but want assistance with motivation and others respond best to a reassuring approach without any technical jargon at all. Swim Types helps you tune into these traits and tailor your communication accordingly. Knowing what to say, when to say it and how to put the message across is the key to successful coaching and this is the area I am most excited about with the Swim Types system. What you see today is a highly-developed system with thousands of hours of coaching experiences behind it. We’ve put a lot of effort into making the system easy to understand and memorable using cartoons and some light-hearted humour but don’t be fooled into thinking we’ve thrown it together in a light-hearted way. Quite the opposite, identify your Swim Type and follow your individual stroke correction process and you’ll make the same sort of rapid progress with your swimming that you would if we were coaching you in person here in Perth. --- Page 147 Text --- ADAM: If ‘typing swimmers’ is a new idea to you then you may have some doubts about how a classification system is possible, I had a lot of questions in my mind when Paul first took me through the concept in 2007. Please keep an open mind as you browse through the information of each Swim Type, read the profiles and watch the video clips on our website.

as you browse through the information of each Swim Type, read the profiles and watch the video clips on our website. I’m absolutely sure you’ll start to recognise swimmers that you know, both in how they swim but also in their personalities. Since we launched the system we’ve spoken to many swimming coaches around the world who have told us how they often think about swimmers in types themselves, albeit without having put a proper system around it. If you’ve already been thinking along these lines yourself, you’ll find it fascinating how we’ve recognised swimmer personality and the ‘two ideal stroke types’ concept in the system. I hope Swim Types gives you new ideas and thoughts for your own coaching and gives you the confidence to step outside the ‘one size fits all’ approach we’ve all been conditioned to use for the last 20 years. Two ‘Ideal’ Swim Types The Swim Type system covers six types of swimmer which we’ve given caricature names: Arnie, Bambino, Kicktastic, Overglider, Swinger and Smooth. The Smooth type is the long stroke style that everyone traditionally thinks of as being fast and efficient. To see an Olympic level Smooth in the flesh is awe inspiring as they slip through the water with grace and purpose. However, a fascinating aspect of the Swim Type system is that it recognises a second stroke style as also being ‘ideal’. The Swinger – in its refined form – is an exceptionally fast and efficient stroke style too and is often used by elite swimmers and triathletes to great effect. It’s a shorter, punchier style that’s won many Olympic Gold Medals in the pool, but in rougher open water its natural emphasis on stroke rhythm makes it completely dominant and is used by a significant majority of elite swimmers in

often used by elite swimmers and triathletes to great effect. It’s a shorter, punchier style that’s won many Olympic Gold Medals in the pool, but in rougher open water its natural emphasis on stroke rhythm makes it completely dominant and is used by a significant majority of elite swimmers in this environment. Until now the Swinger stroke style has been much misunderstood and underappreciated in the swimming world as it is not as aesthetically pleasing as the Smooth style, at least not when viewed above the water. When speaking to Swingers, nearly all are under the impression that they don’t have a very good stroke and that they are succeeding in swimming despite their technique when actually nothing could be further from the truth. If you follow professional cycling there’s an interesting analogy here. Jan Ullrich and Lance Armstrong were famous for racing head to head in the Tour de France with very different pedalling styles. Jan liked to turn over a very big gear, while Lance would spin a smaller gear at a faster speed. Each worked perfectly for each cyclist as it suited their individual biomechanics, style and physiology. The same is true for swimmers and their natural stroke style – you could say the Swinger is Lance Armstrong to the Smooth’s Jan Ullrich. The Swim Types system highlights the strengths and weaknesses of these two ideal styles and shows you which is the best for you to pursue, depending on your individual build and the environment in which you are going to swim.

Split of Swim Type Guides by Gender from website sales. Swim Type ‘Cross-Breeds’ The Swim Types describe the six classic ways that people swim. At Swim Smooth we refer to someone who fits their type perfectly as a ‘classic Overglider’ or ‘classic Arnie’. However it would be an exaggeration to say that all swimmers fit a type perfectly. Generally speaking the more coaching a swimmer has had, the more they move towards another Swim Type and many of these swimmers are mid-way between two types. The most common cross-breed is the Arnie-Overglider. Many Arnies become very frustrated with their swimming and follow common advice to lengthen out their strokes as much as possible by introducing a significant glide. They may still have a poor body position in the water and a tendency to cross over in front of the head, which are relics from their pure-Arnie days. Another common cross-type is the Bambino-Kicktastic. These are normally Bambinos who never really get to grips with arm propulsion and start to over-kick to compensate. Lastly, the Kicktastic-Smooth can be seen in the fast lane of many squads. These can either be Kicktastics who have a reasonable catch technique and

Lastly, the Kicktastic-Smooth can be seen in the fast lane of many squads. These can either be Kicktastics who have a reasonable catch technique and are on their way to being pure-Smooths or Smooths who have lost some of their feel for the water since their competition days and are over-kicking to compensate. --- OCR from Page 149 Image 1 --- Arnie Bambino Kicktastic Overglider Swinger Smooth Female --- Page 150 Text --- If you feel that you are a bit of a cross-breed caught between two types then start off by following the stroke development process for the type from which you originally came. For instance, in the case of the Arnie-Overglider you should follow the Arnie guide first and if you still feel Overglider tendencies then follow the Overglider process afterwards. The Swim Types Website Swim Smooth operates a dedicated website about the Swim Types system which will also be a very useful resource to you at www.swimtypes.com. You’ll find video clips of each Swim Type and also a questionnaire that you can complete to assess your own swimming. The website also sells a full training and development guide of approximately 20 pages in length for each Swim Type. This takes you through each step of your swimming development in greater detail than is possible in this book and shows you the exact steps you need to improve your swimming. If you find the Swim Type system useful for the development of your swimming you will find one of these detailed guides a very useful supplement to the development process provided in this book. Swim Type Personalities Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of

to coaching, they feel very rewarded by every small improvement in their swimming. Kicktastic: Often quiet and self sufficient, Kicktastics can appear a little disinterested or aloof to their fellow swimmers. Underneath the surface they are as keen to improve as any other swimmer but are susceptible to becoming bored while swimming and need a variety of stimuli to maintain focus. --- Page 151 Text --- Overglider: Thoughtful and analytical, this is the swimmer who’s read all the books on swimming and studied all the Youtube videos. Loves to record and analyse data and can normally tell you their times and stroke counts off the top of their heads. Love to use their intellect to improve their swimming but may be susceptible to over-thinking! Swinger: These guys just love to swim! So much so that they often dislike technique work as they feel it interrupts the flow of their session. Normally the first to arrive on the pool deck for a squad session and impatient to get in the water and get on with it. Outgoing and social, these guys are not afraid to wear bright bathers! Smooth: Quiet but with an inner self-confidence, these guys know their place in the pool – at the front of the fast lane! However, after many years of training they can feel uninspired – they know they have the ability to be very quick but sometimes lack motivation to train. --- Page 152 Text --- CHAPTER 18 The Arnie Arnies are normally male but female Arnies do exist, we affectionately refer to them as ‘Arnettes’. At their heart Arnies have a competitive personality across all walks of life, they tend to be naturally athletic and normally excel at sports. For this reason it can come as a bit of a shock that they

classic swimmer we think of who fights the water. A lifting head to breathe, crossing over in front of the head, scissor kicks, kicking from the knee and a low body position are all very much in evidence. If you are an Arnie this may sound like a bad situation to be in but the positive is that innate athleticism of yours. If we can improve your stroke technique so that the effort you are putting in is being used effectively then you stand to make some major strides forwards from where you are now. In terms of pace, classic Arnies swim 1:50 to 3:00 / 100 m for continuous swimming but can normally sprint considerably quicker for short distances. As Arnies develop their strokes they can become quicker than 1:50 / 100 m, albeit they will still be held back by their low body position in the water. See Arnie video clips at: www.swimtypes.com/arnie The classic Arnie with low-lying legs in the water. --- OCR from Page 153 Image 1 --- highly competitive goal-setting personality the classic swimmer who tights the water often frustrated by swimming lean build, sometimes but not always overtly muscular flexibility and range of motion can be poor talented at land-based sports but finds swimming surprisingly hard needs to learn better pace judgement legs tend to lie good natural low in the water resulting sprint ability in high drag --- Page 154 Text --- Arnie Key Stroke Flaws The single biggest thing holding an Arnie back is their low body position in the water, which is caused by a combination of stroke flaws which each need to be tackled in turn: A strong tendency to hold onto their breath underwater which harms relaxation and creates excess buoyancy in the chest, lifting the front end up

the head. Arnies often have stiff upper backs and shoulders, which, combined with this low swinging arm recovery, can exacerbate crossovers further. Whilst it’s possible for any swimmer to have a scissor kick, the Arnie is the most susceptible because of their tendency to cross over in front of the head. This causes a swimmer to lose their balance slightly and give an involuntary (and often subconscious) scissor kick to regain their balance. Scissor kicks add a large amount of drag and act to sink the legs, worsening the drag profile still further. Most Arnies feel a desperate need to get air whilst they swim resulting in a distinct lifting of the head to clear the surface rather than using the bow wave to breathe. This lifting of the head causes the legs to sink downward adding significant drag. Poor ankle flexibility is often a hindrance to Arnies as they have an inability to point their foot straight, leaving the top of the foot out in the water flow. This pulls the legs downward and creates a lot of drag. A little-but-often approach to developing some ankle flexibility will really pay dividends for their swimming. Arnies have a poor catch technique with a dominant push down on the water at the front of the stroke. This only acts to lift the front end upwards and sink the legs without adding any forward propulsion. A straight arm pull-through under the water is common, which over works the shoulder muscle groups. Whilst not strictly stroke technique, Arnies are also the worst culprits when it comes to poor pacing with a real tendency to start a swim or training set too fast and then blow up and slow down dramatically. Developing a good sense of pace awareness and control is a critical skill

not strictly stroke technique, Arnies are also the worst culprits when it comes to poor pacing with a real tendency to start a swim or training set too fast and then blow up and slow down dramatically. Developing a good sense of pace awareness and control is a critical skill for any swimmer trying to reach their potential. For more information on this see Chapter 28. For the full Arnie stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 156 Text --- CHAPTER 19 The Bambino Bambinos are often but not always female and would love to be good at swimming, perhaps not in an overtly competitive way but from a healthy self-fulfilling perspective. Fundamentally, Bambinos lack confidence in the water and this is reflected in their stroke style, which lacks positivity and ‘oomph’. ADAM: If you are a Bambino then don’t fear, we’ll show you how to tune up your stroke technique and build up your confidence in your swimming. A good positive attitude will go a long way in helping with this; be positive in your thoughts and never put yourself down – you deserve much better than that! Bambinos are normally in the speed range between 2:00 and 3:00 per 100 m. A classic Bambino may struggle to complete 25 m of freestyle as they feel like they’re sinking and struggle to breathe. Even as they develop their swimming fitness, many have to stop every length to catch their breath. In terms of developing their strokes, Bambinos defy conventional logic. They only respond slightly to balance and streamlining exercises (the approach for an Arnie for instance) but make much larger improvements by working on their catch and stroke rate, which is traditionally left to more advanced swimmers. This is because they have such poor feel for the water

This is a contributing factor to a Bambino’s anxiety in the water. A slow stroke that lacks rhythm and ‘oomph’. The more anxious a Bambino is in the water, the less positivity there is in their stroke movements. A poor ‘feel for the water’ where the arms slip through with very little purchase or propulsion. Like Arnies, Bambinos often kick from the knee with a jittery action, which creates a lot of drag and pulls the body low in the water. --- Page 159 Text --- A tendency to cross over in front of the head, which further reduces ‘feel for the water’.

This poor feel means that the lead hand collapses down when breathing offering very little support. This is why breathing feels challenging to many Bambinos and they commonly take on water when trying to breathe. Poor kicking technique, often kicking from the knee. This is hard work as it uses the large muscle groups of the quadriceps and hamstrings, and it creates large amounts of drag. A tendency to push the water upwards rather than backwards at the rear of the stroke. This upwards push pulls the legs downward and does not create any propulsion. For the full Bambino stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 160 Text --- CHAPTER 20 The Kicktastic --- Page 161 Text --- Like Bambinos, Kicktastics are often female but unlike Bambinos, they normally have a background in swimming to a greater or lesser extent. As the name suggests, they have a dominant 6-beat kick which powers them through a relatively poor catch phase of the arm stroke in front of the head. They generate very little propulsion from the front of their stroke and make up for this with a push from the legs. Many Kicktastics swam as a young child and then stopped swimming in their teens. This is a very common scenario as young kids always swim with a dominant leg kick before they develop the arm length and proprioceptive feel required for good upper-body propulsion. When Kicktastics resume swimming as an adult they carry on where they left off with the trademark Kicktastic style. PAUL: The problem with over-kicking is that it’s such an inefficient source of propulsion. If we could transfer your propulsion over to your arm stroke you would be swimming much quicker or much easier at the same speed. Despite having a very dominant kick, the action

the trademark Kicktastic style. PAUL: The problem with over-kicking is that it’s such an inefficient source of propulsion. If we could transfer your propulsion over to your arm stroke you would be swimming much quicker or much easier at the same speed. Despite having a very dominant kick, the action is so familiar to Kicktastics that most are unaware of how hard they are kicking. Ironically, many feel their kick is quite weak! In some cases this may be true in terms of propulsion — although all Kicktastics have a vigorous kick, some do not have very good kicking technique and so generate very little propulsion despite the high level of effort. Kicktastics like to kick and kick hard! --- Page 162 Text --- One disadvantage of working so hard with the legs is that it uses a huge amount of oxygen in the body making many Kicktastics short of breath when they swim. Most are aware of this shortness of breath and assume that there’s something wrong with their fitness. ADAM: A good way to prove that it’s the kick causing your shortness of breath is to swim with a pull buoy and keep your legs held straight behind you. Despite potentially being slower as you lose your propulsion from the legs, monitor your breathing and if it feels much easier then that’s cast- iron proof you’re over-kicking in your stroke. Kicktastics vary hugely in terms of swimming speed, ranging between 2:00 per 100 m to under 1:20 per 100 m depending on their level of arm propulsion and also the effectiveness of their kicking technique. At the very fast end there is a crossover with the Smooth Swim Type who also use a propulsive 6-beat kick, albeit with extremely good arm propulsion too! For obvious reasons Kicktastics dislike

At the very fast end there is a crossover with the Smooth Swim Type who also use a propulsive 6-beat kick, albeit with extremely good arm propulsion too! For obvious reasons Kicktastics dislike swimming with a pull buoy (with no leg kick) and are normally significantly slower with one than without.

The personality of a classic Kicktastic is one of the most fascinating: often quiet and reserved, Kicktastics seem to shy away from attention or standing out from the crowd

just bring it under control. Kicktastics have a strong tendency to pull through underwater with a straight arm. A very strong energy-sapping leg kick. Slower Kicktastics may kick excessively from the knee, which produces less propulsion and more drag. Poor catch and ‘feel for the water’, normally pushing down on the water at the front of the stroke with a straight arm rather than bending the elbow and pressing the water backwards. Crossovers in front of the head are common with Kicktastics, further harming their ‘feel for the water’. Unlike the other classic offender of a crossover (the Arnie), Kicktastics don’t typically display a scissor kick due to the rapid continuous movement of the legs smothering this effect. Many Kicktastics pull through with a very straight arm under the body, over-working the weaker shoulder muscles, which are not powerful enough to generate much propulsion. A good stroke technique involves bending the elbow so that the larger muscles of the back, chest and core are engaged with the movement. Poor body rotation, resulting in the arm recovering round the side of the body rather than over the top. For classic Kicktastics with restricted upper backs this can be very tight and awkward. For the full Kicktastic stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 164 Text --- CHAPTER 21 The Overglider --- Page 165 Text --- Overgliders are normally swimmers who learned freestyle as adults, they tend to be thoughtful individuals who have studied swimming carefully in books or on the internet. In nearly every case they have latched on to the idea that, to be an efficient swimmer, the freestyle stroke should be long with minimum strokes taken per length. Above the water they can look smooth and relaxed but under the water we see why they are not as

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
doh! --- Page 166 Text --- An overglide in the stroke creates an additional problem, it slows the stroke rate right down and causes the swimmer to lose touch with their rhythm and timing. The freestyle stroke should be smooth and continuous, moving seamlessly from one phase to another. A dead spot and pause interrupts this rhythm, which quickly becomes imprinted in the stroke timing and can be as hard to remove, or harder, than other stroke flaws. This is ironic as many Overgliders are trying to avoid imprinting bad stroke habits by swimming correctly at all times. A typical Overglider learns freestyle as an adult and makes good initial progress as they diligently improve their body position and rotation in the water. However, they quite quickly reach a speed and efficiency plateau which they can’t seem to break through. The speed at which they can swim is normally heavily dependant on their height and arm length with many taller Overgliders reaching around 1:40 per 100 m and shorter swimmers around 2:00 per 100 m before hitting a plateau. Overgliders often realise they need to lift their tempo and stroke rate to improve their swimming but when they try to do so they keep the glide in place in their stroke and speed up every other movement. If you’ve tried this yourself you will know it is very hard work, a little like driving down the freeway with the handbrake on! Instead, the key is to remove the glide by improving your catch technique, this naturally lifts up the stroke rate while keeping all other movements at the same speed. When you learn to coordinate a better catch and remove the glide, you will gain a significant increase in speed for little, if any, increase in effort. The classic Overglider:

Unfortunately this goes against the principal of specificity in training (see Chapter 24) and the resultant de-training can see many of these swimmers becoming slower in their races. If you have neglected your swimming fitness then you stand to make some large gains in speed from getting back into some training using Chapter 27

the principal of specificity in training (see Chapter 24) and the resultant de-training can see many of these swimmers becoming slower in their races. If you have neglected your swimming fitness then you stand to make some large gains in speed from getting back into some training using Chapter 27 of this book. Overgliders and Open Water As we discuss in Key 3: Open Water Adaptation, open water swimming is distinctly different to pool swimming as waves and chop constantly buffet you. Even in an otherwise flat lake or river, the wake from other swimmers is enough to disturb your progress and interrupt your stroke rhythm. If you swim in open water with a slow stroke rate and an overglide you will be slowed down and stalled in the gap between strokes by disturbed water. Swimmers with a faster more continuous stroke (e.g. Swingers) cut through open water much more efficiently as the delay between strokes is much smaller or in some cases non-existent. This stroke style is very efficient in open water. As a result of pausing with the lead hand, Overgliders have a tendency to ‘catch-up’ and bring both hands together in front of the head. --- Page 168 Text --- PAUL: From working with Overgliders I know that many are frustrated with their performances in the open water. This may be partially offset by the added buoyancy and so improved body position offered by a wetsuit but for the effort you are putting in (both intellectual and physical) you deserve to swim much more effectively in this environment.

physical) you deserve to swim much more effectively in this environment. Overglider Key Stroke Flaws The Overglider’s dominant stroke flaw is a large dead spot in their stroke timing caused by the introduction of a long glide into their stroke. Working on their catch technique and developing their stroke rhythm will get them off the speed and efficiency plateau they find themselves on. A long pause-and-glide is always present at the front of an Overglider’s stroke, interrupting their rhythm and causing them to decelerate significantly during the resultant dead spot. Many Overgliders’ recovering arms ‘catch up’ at the front giving what is known as ‘catch-up timing’. A much better timing is where the hands just pass in front of the head with the stroking arm already into the catch phase as the recovering arm comes past the head. A poor catch technique with the elbow dropping and very often the palm of the hand facing forwards ‘putting on the brakes’. This is a by-product of trying to swim with a long slow stroke style since the poor catch technique acts to slow the stroke down (see Chapter 13) and so supports the desire to glide. After the glide, the swimmer has to rush the catch to get the stroke back underway. A hurried catch action causes the hand to slip backwards with very little purchase on the water. It is common to see Overgliders only breathing to one side as they swim, normally this is because their stroke rate is so slow that it’s too long between breaths to breathe every three strokes. Over time breathing to one side develops a lopsided stroke with a lack of symmetry, this is particularly a problem for open water swimming where it can cause the swimmer to track off course constantly. After the

now get to see the beautiful part of their stroke: under the water. Here a refined Swinger’s stroke mechanics are poetry in motion: a great catch and perfect rhythm and timing all working together in perfect harmony! In terms of speed, Swingers cover a very large range depending on the level of refinement in their strokes. Unrefined Swingers may swim 1:45 / 100 m, while an elite level Swinger with a refined stroke can swim sub 1:00 / 100 m pace — matching Smooth types over distances of 400 m and over. Swingers have a natural disposition towards distance swimming and normally dislike sprint training. Their personality is very go-getting and they like to get on with things without waiting around or thinking about it too much! Swimming legend Shelley Taylor-Smith shows the refined Swinger style: bent elbow catch underwater and the recovering arm swinging around the side. --- OCR from Page 172 Image 1 --- experienced swimmer, normally with a competitive swimming background a fast choppy stroke style that oozes rhythm many elite swimmers are swingers, particularly open water swimmers and professional triathletes a natural disposition to distance swimming and dislikes sprinting most commonly found in Masters swim squads may have received unfavourable comments about their stroke in the past in comparison to smoother swimmers outgoing go-getting personality possibly lacking a litte patience hates kick sets often found in unrefined form with crossovers and a poor catch faster stroke rate style naturally suits a 2-beat kick classic swingers love to get on and swim with minimum stoppages or distractions such as drills likes to wear bright bathers! --- Page 173 Text --- Whilst there are examples of Swingers performing well with a 6-beat kick, a classic Swinger really comes into their own with a 2-beat kick.

to get on and swim with minimum stoppages or distractions such as drills likes to wear bright bathers! --- Page 173 Text --- Whilst there are examples of Swingers performing well with a 6-beat kick, a classic Swinger really comes into their own with a 2-beat kick. A refined Swinger uses their kick with great timing, using it to drive their body rotation from one side to the other, which in turn drives the arm stroke. Whilst they may not achieve much propulsion directly from their kick, they use it to drive the arm stroke which is a much more efficient use of the kick effort. To achieve really high stroke rates a Swinger needs to use a 2-beat kick, a 6-beat kick simply becomes too rapid at these stroke rates to keep up with (see Chapter 9 on the various kicking styles). PAUL: When I ask an Overglider what they think of when they swim, they can list off several parts of their stroke they are thinking about at any one time! But ask a Swinger the same question and you tend to get a blank look or an answer like ‘nothing really!’. A Swinger’s ability (and preference) to switch off their brain and just swim is a strength in many ways. Focused stroke technique development has an important place in swimming (and Swingers may well be guilty of skipping over this part of their preparation) but at other times it’s very important to stop analysing and just swim, which is when the Swinger’s ‘stop talking and let me get on with it’ personality really comes into its own! Unrefined Swingers may have stroke faults such as crossovers, scissor kicks and a hurried catch but the fundamental punch and rhythm is always in place. If you are a Swinger

which is when the Swinger’s ‘stop talking and let me get on with it’ personality really comes into its own! Unrefined Swingers may have stroke faults such as crossovers, scissor kicks and a hurried catch but the fundamental punch and rhythm is always in place. If you are a Swinger whose stroke has become a little ragged over the years you need to take some time out to work on some refinements in your stroke technique. You’ll polish up quite quickly and will soon be back to what you love best — swimming long sets and swimming them fast! Swingers and Open Water Swimming Open water swimming is a natural strength of Swingers and they really become a dominant force in this environment. Their faster stroke rate style helps punch through chop and wake from other swimmers and the longer distance races suit their natural disposition towards endurance events. Where they may lose out to some talented swimmers with long smooth strokes in the pool, they are able to turn the tables on them in open water. Becoming a Swinger In many ways there are two types of Swinger, those who naturally adopt this style (‘classic Swingers’) and those who have developed their strokes towards this style out of necessity. Many swimmers who are short in height or with short arms are forced to use a shorter faster stroke style to swim quickly and efficiently, and so gravitate towards the Swinger style as they develop their strokes. Others are looking to race well in longer distance open water events or triathlon, so even though they are capable of swimming with the Smooth style they choose to adopt the Swinger route to be more efficient in this environment. Very often such swimmers are able to switch between the two stroke styles

to race well in longer distance open water events or triathlon, so even though they are capable of swimming with the Smooth style they choose to adopt the Swinger route to be more efficient in this environment. Very often such swimmers are able to switch between the two stroke styles at will. --- Page 174 Text --- Be wary of drawing the conclusion that those with long arms suit a Smooth stroke style and those with shorter arms the Swinger style. Whilst the latter may be true, the former isn’t. There are many swimmers with long arms who swim naturally — and extremely quickly — with a Swinger style, Laure Manadou and Shelley Taylor-Smith being prime examples. Unrefined Swinger — Classic Stroke Flaws Swingers are accomplished swimmers and for this reason their strokes don’t need a major overhaul. Instead, they are likely to need a tune-up in a few areas, removing any crossovers, tuning up their catch technique and possibly formalising a 2-beat kick. A common flaw in unrefined Swingers is a crossover in front of the head on hand entry or crossing over the centre line under the body. Over the years this may have gradually crept in as flexibility and posture has worsened since their days as a junior swimmer. A thumb-first entry into the water is another common flaw seen. In some cases this feels like a natural way of entering to the swimmer while in other cases they were coached to enter thumb first as junior swimmers. In either case this needs to be rectified because of the high risk of shoulder injury from a thumb-first entry — in fact many Swingers already suffer from shoulder pain for this reason. A hurried catch phase results from a Swinger’s desire to get on and swim at a

swimmers. In either case this needs to be rectified because of the high risk of shoulder injury from a thumb-first entry — in fact many Swingers already suffer from shoulder pain for this reason. A hurried catch phase results from a Swinger’s desire to get on and swim at a high tempo. Taking a little longer over the catch will allow the swimmer to get into a better high-elbow catch position and gain a better purchase on the water. Many Swingers have become a little too flat in the water over the years and need to stretch out just a little more in their strokes. The right balance always needs to be struck between stroke length and stroke rate — whilst a Swinger definitely sits towards the shorter faster end of this spectrum it’s possible to take this a little too far and ‘over-rev’. In these cases adding a touch more stroke length is recommended. Sam shows us three common Swinger flaws in one photo: holding breath, thumb-first entry and crossing the centre line underwater. Despite their experience as swimmers, Swingers can be some of the worst culprits when it comes to holding their breath under water. By improving their exhalation technique Swingers should be able to breathe bilaterally quite easily; in fact with their fast stroke rate breathing every five strokes may be an option. For the full Swinger stroke correction process see Appendix B. --- Page 175 Text --- CHAPTER 23 The Smooth --- Page 176 Text --- The Smooth Swim Type is what everybody thinks of when they imagine a long efficient stroke style.

as being like those of an Olympic gymnast or ballet dancer — they have tremendous grace and poise but to do so they are using strength and control. --- Page 177 Text --- Olympian Jono Van Hazel shows us his classical high elbow recovery. This is an important distinction to understand as many swimmers aspiring to the Smooth stroke style try and introduce the concept of ‘effortless swimming’ into their own strokes, which results in a slow stroke with poor rhythm and timing — anything but efficient. Although Smooths can look as though they have a slow stroke rate this is an illusion brought about by the sheer speed at which they are moving relative to their stroke rate. Smooths operate in the 65—75 strokes per minute range at a steady pace, 75—85 strokes per minute at race pace and even higher when sprinting 50 m. In contrast most Overgliders (who very much aspire to be Smooths) are swimming at 50 strokes per minute and below, slowed down by the imprinted pause-and-glide in their strokes. --- OCR from Page 177 Image 1 --- accomplished swimmer with a competitve swimming background, only found in the top lane of squads been there, seen it, done it!

A lack of motivation is a common theme for them, and I find the key to inspiring them is to change the environment. Many Smooths have developed severe ‘black-line-fever’ from childhood and dislike hard training in the pool as it brings back too many bad memories! The solution to this is to set yourself some new challenges by moving to the open water — either pure swimming events or by getting into triathlon. As we’ll see later, you might have to make some modifications to your stroke to reach your potential in the great outdoors! As adults, Smooths often suffer from a lack of motivation. Whilst they are normally quiet and modest characters, they are also very confident in their own abilities in the water and they know that if they put the effort back into training they could become an extremely fast swimmer again. This is not an issue, the real question is can they conquer their motivational demons and get inspired again? Smooths and Open Water Compared to Swingers, Smooths have a longer stroke with a slower stroke rate. Whilst they don’t pause and glide in their stroke like an Overglider, this lower stroke rate is still a disadvantage in open water and can cause them to be stalled slightly as they are buffeted by chop and wake

each stroke is slightly easier in itself. As a Smooth you are going to have a nice symmetrical stroke which will help you track straight in open water but developing your drafting, sighting and navigation skills is also going to be critical to take on the open water specialists who are very strong in these areas. As a Smooth transitioning to the open water, you’ll really find the advice in Key 3 very beneficial and hopefully it will add a renewed enthusiasm to your swimming. Smooth Stroke Flaws ADAM: A Smooth’s stroke flaws? You might be thinking this could be a short section! But actually without good coaching feedback since their competitive swimming days a Smooth’s stroke will tend to deteriorate slightly and they probably have one or two small areas of their stroke they need to work on, most commonly their catch technique. You will still look good in the water but might well have started to over-kick to compensate for a slight loss in your arm stroke propulsion. If you have been out of the water for a few years you’ll soon brush up and you may be surprised at how quickly you can swim again, perhaps even breaking some old PBs in the process. Pressing down on the water slightly with a straight arm during the catch is the most common stroke flaw seen with Smooths. You’ll still be generating reasonable propulsion with your arm stroke but pressing downward wastes energy and will harm your stroke’s rhythm. Over-kicking slightly (perhaps becoming a little Kicktastic) is another common flaw with Smooths and is related to that slight deterioration in arm stroke propulsion. When you restore your catch and ‘feel for the water’ to its former glory this leg kick will fall away naturally and you’ll notice the reduced

When you restore your catch and ‘feel for the water’ to its former glory this leg kick will fall away naturally and you’ll notice the reduced oxygen demand from a less vigorous kick. --- Page 179 Text --- Michelle is a classic Smooth who’s been out of the water for a while. Her kicking technique and exhalation is still in good order but she’s just overreaching a little and dropping her elbow a touch. This will harm her ‘feel for the water’. A slight overglide with the wrist dropping on arm extension is another common flaw if the Smooth has been trying to emphasise the length of their stroke. With so much literature on the internet focusing on this aspect of swimming technique it’s little wonder some Smooths are influenced by it and introduce a small glide into their stroke timing. Professional triathlete Guy Crawford is a Smooth who needs a little tune-up with his catch technique. He’s about to bend his elbow to catch the water but he needs to do this a little sooner — we should already start to see the elbow bend in this shot. Holding onto your breath is something that is taught to many sprinters, which by definition includes most Smooths! With a powerful sprint kick, the extra buoyancy in the chest does not cause the swimmer’s legs to sink and effective breathing is not critical over sprint distances. However for distance freestyle it’s very important to use a constant smooth exhalation whenever your face is in the water. Late breathing timing is a surprisingly common flaw seen in Smooths. This occurs where the rotation of the head to breathe

Balancing your stroke technique development with the right fitness work is essential. Training consistently in the pool is one of the keys to improving your swimming. The training methods we will recommend in this section will put a new lease of life into the idea of fitness training for distance swimmers and triathletes, and will help you discard some myths about what this type of training entails.

Getting out of bed at ‘stupid-o’clock’ to swim before work is much easier when you have something to focus on! My boyhood dream was always to swim the English Channel. As a child I was a competitive pool swimmer and this just seemed to be the event that all British pool swimmers would eventually gravitate towards. In 2006 I was surprised to see that my ‘comedy hero’ David Walliams from the British comedy show ‘Little Britain’ would be attempting the Channel. The level of interest in swimming within the UK that David’s successful crossing raised has been nothing short of amazing, so much so that I often hear from people with no swimming background at all who have set swimming the Channel as their personal goal. Whilst tackling the Channel is still no mean feat, David’s crossing has helped show people that they really can get out there and do it. For the sport of swimming this is just fantastic and in September 2011 not only did I get to achieve my lifelong dream of swimming the Channel, I also got to meet and swim with David Walliams on the second day of his epic eight-day swim down the River Thames for Sport Relief.

A fantastic event and well worth the long flight to Australia! Balancing Your Training for Best Performance When it comes to swim training, many swimmers and triathletes fall into one of two camps: those that train hard every session with little regard for their stroke efficiency and those who have been led to believe that swimming is entirely about technique work and that hard workouts should be avoided as they will ingrain bad stroke habits. --- Page 183 Text --- However, too much focus on either pure technique work or hard fitness sessions without consideration for the other side of the equation is a recipe for underperforming. Focusing on one area to the detriment of the other is the single biggest reason why swimmers and triathletes hit plateaus in their performance. If you know how to balance out training and technique work within a weekly or monthly structure you will make the greatest improvements possible over time. Even then, you still need to take additional steps to adapt your pool stroke to the open water environment if this is where you will be racing, we will discuss this in detail later in Key 3. A plateau in your performance will occur when you have exhausted all avenues for improvement within that given area. If you only ever focus on one aspect of your swimming development, then chances are you are going to reach that plateau very quickly.

Swim Specific Fitness If you are a triathlete, or are swimming alongside training in another sport, it is very important to appreciate that fitness is specific to the sport you are training in. In sports science this is a well proven fact [1, 2] and is known as the ‘specificity principle’. Training in other sports — particularly those that involve different muscle groups such as cycling and running — will have very little benefit for your swimming. This is because an important part of your aerobic system is in the vein and capillary networks to specific muscles and in the cellular development within the muscles themselves. In other words, you need to train your swimming muscle groups in a way specific to the swimming. Far and away the best way to do this is by swim fitness training! Emmy prepares to tackle a tough threshold session in the pool but it’s all smiles here! --- Page 184 Text --- If you are new to swimming and have a high level of fitness in another sport then we are sure that you would have quickly and independently proven the specificity principle to be true!

of each component which are loosely aimed at each of the six Swim Types. Use them to construct your own training sessions and so perfectly balance your technique, fitness and open water skills work. You can follow any of the sets for any other Swim Type, they will all be useful for your swimming. PAUL: Given the variety of the five types of main sets listed (including six open water skills sessions and six pure technique sets), our Swim Smooth boffins have calculated that by mixing and matching the sets you can create up to 5,100 unique training sessions to follow. Wow — that’ll keep you going for a while! How Will the Different Types of Set Improve My Swimming? We can break down the different types of main set as follows: 1. Speed or sprint work. 2. Endurance training or continuous swimming. 3. Threshold or ‘Sustainable Speed’ sessions. Let’s take a look at each of these training methods in that order. It’s actually the order in which many Masters swimmers and triathletes prioritise their sessions, focusing a lot of training time on speed sessions, some time on endurance sets and relatively little time on sustained speed sessions. In Chapter 26 we will look at a different way to combine these sessions for best training effect as a distance swimmer has a very different set of priorities. By combining sessions in a different way you will soon be making some big strides forward in your swimming fitness. Session Type 1: Pure Speed or Sprint Work --- Page 187 Text --- For those of you who train with one of the many Masters swimming groups around the world, a large component of the training mix will be sprint work.

Pure Speed or Sprint Work --- Page 187 Text --- For those of you who train with one of the many Masters swimming groups around the world, a large component of the training mix will be sprint work. This involves efforts at near maximum pace over short distances of 10 m to 200 m with large amounts of recovery between each interval. For many swimmers, this type of training is believed to be the best way of getting faster because they are swimming at very high speed. Certainly if you will be racing over sprint distances (25 m to 200 m) such sets should form a good portion of your training time as they are specific to your event. However, if your focus is on distances over 400 m in the pool, or on triathlon and open water swimming, too much training at this intensity can actually limit your endurance ability as we will see later on in this chapter. Sprint sessions offer the swimmer significant rest periods between each interval to allow higher intensities to be held when swimming. The ratio of work to rest might be anywhere from 3:1 to 1:1 (or more). An example sprint set is: Sprint training is essential if you plan to race in events of less than 200 m. If not then your valuable training time might be best spent with sub-maximal threshold sessions and aerobic endurance work. 8 × 50 m aiming for 40 seconds per interval with 20 to 30 seconds rest between each 50 m In Appendix C you will find six specific sprint sessions that you can incorporate into your programme if you are seeking to improve your outright speed for shorter events below 400 m. If you are competing over longer distances and swimming five or more times

rest between each 50 m In Appendix C you will find six specific sprint sessions that you can incorporate into your programme if you are seeking to improve your outright speed for shorter events below 400 m. If you are competing over longer distances and swimming five or more times per week, then you also probably have some scope to add this type of training to your weekly programme so long as it does not replace more essential threshold-based training. Session Type 2: Endurance Sessions In its simplest form an endurance session might be a long continuous swim at a steady pace, designed to build up your ability to swim for a prolonged period of time without stopping. It is very common to see swimmers who have only a very limited time in which to train (e.g. lunch breaks) jump into the water and simply swim continuously for the entire time they have available. This type of training has its merits, however if every --- Page 188 Text --- session that you complete is swum continuously like this you could be missing out on developing your stroke technique and also run the risk of stagnating from swimming everything at the same steady pace. The mental challenge of longer swims can be significant as you are stuck in your personal ‘bubble’ with very little outside interaction. Here James has used the acronym JKS (Just Keep Swimming!) to keep him motivated during the 20 km Rottnest Channel Swim. This phrase went on to become a mantra of our marathon swimming squad! For those swimmers and triathletes attempting longer distance events (e.g. open water events longer than 2.5 km and triathletes training for a full Ironman), long continuous swims are a nice way of building your confidence that you can cover your target

to become a mantra of our marathon swimming squad! For those swimmers and triathletes attempting longer distance events (e.g. open water events longer than 2.5 km and triathletes training for a full Ironman), long continuous swims are a nice way of building your confidence that you can cover your target race distance. Later in Chapter 27 we will show you how to calculate the pace to hold for these swims so that you develop your base endurance whilst maintaining good form and technique. A classic mistake swimmers make with long continuous swims is to start too fast and then fade towards the end. Breaking down these endurance swims into a series of longer intervals with a short rest in-between will help you maintain focus and motivation and also give you a chance to take on board fluid and nutrition for swims over 45 minutes in length. Fuelling correctly in longer sessions is critical to your successful completion of these sessions and how quickly you recover afterwards. We will cover some specific fuelling strategies for longer swims in Chapter 32. An example of a simple endurance set might be 6 × 400 m at 75% effort with 30 seconds rest between each interval. Instead of thinking of this as 75% effort, you could swim this as ‘threshold pace plus eight seconds per 100 m’. We will look at this form of pace calculation later in Chapter 27. In Appendix C you will find six specific endurance sessions ranging in distance from 2.5 km to 6 km. These are designed to be completed without using one of the additional warm-up and build set suggestions as the warm-up is included within the main body of these sessions and encourages you to start off at a conservative pace as though you were starting a

2.5 km to 6 km. These are designed to be completed without using one of the additional warm-up and build set suggestions as the warm-up is included within the main body of these sessions and encourages you to start off at a conservative pace as though you were starting a longer distance race. We would advise 10—15 minutes of light mobilisation and stretching work as per Chapter 29 before you start these sessions. --- Page 189 Text --- Session Type 3: Threshold or Sustainable Speed Sessions At the heart of any good swim training programme is some dedicated work at threshold speed, often termed ‘race pace’ if your race distance is around 1500 m. Threshold speed is a pace that is tough enough to develop your aerobic capacity but not so strong that significant recovery is required between intervals. Generally speaking, recovery is faster from these sessions than from sets performed at a higher intensity. Developing your ability to swim well at this intensity is a key determinant of how well you will perform in races of 400 m and longer. As we shall see shortly in Chapter 27, we refer to this form of training as ‘CSS’ — short for Critical Swim Speed. PAUL: The ironic thing about this type of training is that as soon as the phrase ‘race pace’ is mentioned by a coach, swimmers act like a red rag to a bull, setting off way faster than they can sustain for the set. Don’t make this mistake yourself, if you do you will soon blow-up and slow down — swimming most of the set at a slower pace than you otherwise could maintain if you had set off at the right pace. If this happens you have greatly harmed the training effect of the session and

mistake yourself, if you do you will soon blow-up and slow down — swimming most of the set at a slower pace than you otherwise could maintain if you had set off at the right pace. If this happens you have greatly harmed the training effect of the session and you will not develop your aerobic system to anywhere like the same extent as with a well-paced set. Arnies (from our Swim Type system, see Chapter 18) are particularly prone to doing this. I know from my own experience during my early days as a junior triathlete that the mention of the words ‘race pace’ or ‘time trial’ induces a sense of wild panic. If you try to remain calm in these situations and pace out such a swim perfectly, you might swim a PB straight away. Swimmers with very poor pacing always report that their swimming feels easy and smooth in the first couple of hundred meters but then their stroke quickly ‘falls apart’. They might blame a lack of fitness, endurance or the inability to hold good form, and whilst this might partly be the case, nine times out of ten it is simply a pacing issue. Repetitively training like this is not effective at all and will certainly impede your long- term development. In fact inaccurate pace judgement is one of the main reasons swimmers and triathletes fail to reach their potential in the water. ADAM: A coach we work closely with in Montréal, Canada (Charles Gaston-Couturier) describes the challenge of a good training set using something he calls the ‘Sweet Uncertainty Principle’ based on work done by Brunelle in 1988 [1].

describes the challenge of a good training set using something he calls the ‘Sweet Uncertainty Principle’ based on work done by Brunelle in 1988 [1]. A good training set challenges you just enough so that you are a little unsure of whether you can complete the set hitting your goal times. If the set is clearly too easy you would lack stimulation and if the set is clearly too hard to complete this would be very negative and off-putting. Somewhere in between is the sweet spot of the perfect training set: you are uncertain of whether you can meet the goal times and motivated by the challenge of doing so. Accurate identification of your own threshold (CSS) pace is very important and tuning into the feeling of this pace at the start, middle and end of a training session will allow you to better gauge your efforts. This important skill is what we call ‘innate pace judgement’ and developing yours will pay dividends during races when everyone around you starts too fast and then fades badly. When performing a threshold set, the focus should be on swimming longer intervals at a challenging but sustainable pace with much shorter recovery periods between each interval rather than pure speed work. Many swimmers end up in a grey area between --- Page 190 Text --- these two types of sessions, not swimming quite fast enough for it to be a speed set but taking too much rest between each interval for it to be a true threshold set. Swimmers in Perth prepare for their favourite ‘Fresh and Fruity’ threshold session with Coach Fiona Ford leading the way. The ratio of work to rest should be 4:1 to 15:1 or shorter, e.g. 8 × 200 m aiming for 3′15″ with 15 to 20 seconds

be a true threshold set. Swimmers in Perth prepare for their favourite ‘Fresh and Fruity’ threshold session with Coach Fiona Ford leading the way. The ratio of work to rest should be 4:1 to 15:1 or shorter, e.g. 8 × 200 m aiming for 3′15″ with 15 to 20 seconds rest between each 200 m. With such short recoveries it is essential to pace yourself through the set to be assured of completing the session whilst hitting the target times. When you conduct training around this intensity you will be able to maintain much better form and technique than if you go off too fast and end up fighting the water. Many swimmers avoid training at higher intensities for fear of ingraining bad stroke habits but your stroke will only deteriorate if you pace things poorly and blow-up. At threshold pace it is perfectly possible to sustain great technique and you should not be avoiding this ‘sustained speed’ training, it is absolutely essential for your improvement. In Appendix C you will find six specific threshold sessions that you can target for the main set of your harder training sessions. To perform these properly you will need to know your threshold or CSS pace; we will show you how to test for this in Chapter 27. Reference 1.

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
Your Swimming Month Most triathletes are swimming between two and four sessions per week. As a Masters swimmer or as a pure recreational swimmer, you might have time in your weekly routine to swim more frequently. In any case, developing a good skeleton structure that you can adhere to on a weekly and monthly basis will ensure that you are maximising your time in the pool for your available training time. Ideally, to see true improvements in your swimming you should aim to swim three or more times per week. We often see in our Swim Smooth Perth squads that those who go from swimming two times per week to three times per week really make some good gains in their swimming, often within just six to eight weeks of making this change to their programme. Frequency will always trump volume, for example three 30-minute sessions per week will be more beneficial than one 90-minute session. Of course, you can only train in the time you have available and as long as you are realistic about what can be achieved if you only swim once or twice per week, then you will take away some of the frustration of expecting large gains for relatively little input. Equally though, increasing your frequency from swimming six times per week to seven times per week might not result in any significant increase in performance at all and may risk lethargy, over-training and demotivation. There is nothing more important than turning up at training motivated about the session ahead and if you swim too often you risk losing this ‘mojo’. If you’re swimming five times per week or more and find that you are constantly dreading your swimming sessions and have no motivation for them, try dropping back by one session per week and

motivated about the session ahead and if you swim too often you risk losing this ‘mojo’. If you’re swimming five times per week or more and find that you are constantly dreading your swimming sessions and have no motivation for them, try dropping back by one session per week and see if you can regain your spark. Elite swimmers and triathletes are particularly susceptible to over-training, and making a marginal cut in training volume has been the key for many of them in making some big steps forward in their performance. Paul and Martin plan the next phase of training for the Perth Swim Smooth squad. --- Page 192 Text --- More is not always better — effective training is about striking the right balance given everything you are trying to juggle in your training, work, family and social lives. PAUL: As a triathlete, coach and graduate of sports science, over the years I have invested a significant amount of my research and personal training time into devising the ideal training programme that has exactly the right training hours and precise training intensities. Ultimately this was a fruitless exercise as I found time and time again that what works for one athlete is simply not effective for another and that life events quickly ruin the prescribed training progression, often within just a few weeks of starting the programme. Instead, a much more pragmatic approach works best where you outline a basic skeleton structure which you work from loosely day to day, week to week and month to month. The structure gives you the right mix of sessions between technique development, steady endurance training, threshold sets and pure speed work which you can repeat over and over to give you the consistency you need.

day, week to week and month to month. The structure gives you the right mix of sessions between technique development, steady endurance training, threshold sets and pure speed work which you can repeat over and over to give you the consistency you need. The pace of the sessions themselves is adjusted based on your performances as you go along, adapting to your current fitness levels to keep pushing you forwards. Using such a skeleton structure when training is a very elegant and pragmatic approach and I highly recommend you use one yourself. In a moment we will look at some suggested structures for you to follow, depending on your ability level and the training time available. In terms of scheduling additional recovery time into your plan I recommend you very much listen to your body here, especially if you are only training two or three times per week. In this situation it is unlikely that you are training enough to warrant additional recovery and so if you feel good, carry on training as normal. If you feel a little flat after a hard block of training then take an easy session or some additional rest. My best results have always come from programmes that were simple, fun and motivating and that were laid out in such a way that I could consistently follow them week to week rather than the super whizz-bang scientifically prepared periodised programmes I’ve also tried to follow. Of course you have to have purpose and meaning behind what you do but if you are unable to adhere to a really sophisticated programme then you’re not going to get the most out of it.

At the end of the day life throws curve-balls at all of us when we least expect it and if you can’t be flexible in your programme for risk of throwing that period of training out of the window entirely, then you’re going to find yourself getting very frustrated very quickly. Interestingly enough, this skeleton-structure approach was inspired by my own long-term coach and former British Triathlon Head Coach, Chris Jones. With all the great triathletes on the British World Class Triathlon Programme, we would all aim to keep things as simple and consistent as possible in our training routine. The training structure of elite athletes is nowhere near as technical as you might believe. Recommended Skeleton Structures Table 26.3 shows our recommended training structures, which are to be followed based upon how many times per week you are swimming. As you can see, we include a mix --- OCR from Page 192 Image 1 --- 2 ae = eS ee ik. --- Page 193 Text --- of all three of the training keys — technique, training and open water skills. You can follow these structures year round, performing your open water skills work in the pool when open water is too cold in the winter. As we will discuss in Key 3: Open Water Adaptation, developing and maintaining your open water skills is absolutely critical to swimming at your best in open water.

Table 26.4 Paul Newsome’s English Channel skeleton training structure. A balanced programme appropriate to your race distance and the training time available will make all the difference to your success in the water. Day Session Detail Monday Very easy 2—3 km swim including a range of drills to ensure good injury management OR Rest Day Tuesday Moderate 6—7 km pool swim including drills and a solid 4—6 km main set of 10 to 15 × 400 m at 1’24′ per 100 m pace with 21 seconds rest between each 400 m (guided by my Wetronome). WednesdayTough 9 km pool set swam on a 43 to 45 second per 50 m cycle, e.g. 20 × 50 m, 10 × 100 m, 5 × 200 m, 2 × 500 m, 1 × 1000 m, 2 × 500 m, 5 × 200 m, 10 × 100 m, 20 × 50 m. The cycle time includes any rest, so the faster you swim the more rest you get. I would typically average 1′18″ per 100 m for these sets. Thursday Moderate 10 km cold (15°C/59°F) open water swim at an average pace of ∼1′24″ per 100 m including drink stops every 2 km for 15—20 seconds.

If you have a sprint background in the pool, or alternatively if you come from a team sport background such as rugby or football, you will probably have a natural disposition towards sprinting. Instead of sprinting powerfully over a short distance, a good distance swimmer has a very different physiology as they need to maintain a slower pace for a long time. However, the different energy systems are highly trainable and with the right training you will gradually transition towards the distance swimmer you need to be for open water races and triathlon. At Swim Smooth we often use the analogy that sprinters are petrol (gasoline) engines and distance swimmers are diesel engines. The further your target event is the less fast- twitch speed matters and the sustained output of a diesel engine becomes more important. We are not talking about swimming at an easy pace here but a strong and sustained pace as you might in a bike time trial or distance running event.

The shirt shows the breakdown of a swimming diesel engine! --- OCR from Page 195 Image 1 --- set ene GEN GINEL --- Page 196 Text --- For the rest of this section of the book we are going to look at something called CSS swimming. This is a form of training that focuses on developing you as a distance swimmer, turning you from that petrol engine into a swimmer who can sustain their speed over long durations. By following this form of training you may lose some of your ability to sprint but your sustained speed will be much higher. Figure 27.17 shows a hypothetical example of this transition from petrol to diesel engine. FIGURE 27.17 The speed profiles of two very different swimmers. The sprinter wins over very short distances, the distance swimmer over longer distances. To put some real numbers on this, take a look at Table 27.5 showing Paul’s race speed at different distances before and during his English Channel preparation. Before training for the Channel Paul’s training contained a mix of sprint work and CSS sets, during the training he switched almost exclusively to CSS training and endurance training. We can see that although he became slower over 50 m, 100 m, and 200 m, by 400 m he is swimming at the same pace and at longer distances significantly quicker. When you have to swim the equivalent of 100 × 400 m to get across from Dover to France, sprint ability is not something you need too much of! Table 27.5 Paul Newsome’s race pace over different

to slow back down again. CSS is this point in your swimming, go faster than it and you will have to slow down, but swim at CSS and you will be able to swim for 800 m, 1500 m or even 3000 m if you are very well trained. PAUL: I studied Sports and Exercise Science at the University of Bath and was also fortunate enough to be selected as an athlete for the British Triathlon World Class Performance Programme. On this elite programme we were regularly tested in the laboratory to examine our exact level of fitness and to give us precise training levels at which to train. This approach was highly scientific and I loved being part of it. Knowing how you should train and seeing the improvements as a result of this testing was very motivating indeed. However, whilst very useful, such testing simply isn’t available to most age-group athletes around the world. The test procedures are lengthy, involve using a lot of expensive laboratory equipment and by taking lots of blood samples to monitor blood lactate they are quite invasive too. Fortunately there is an alternative way of assessing your swimming fitness that has all of the advantages of laboratory testing but with none of those downsides. The system is called Critical Swim Speed or CSS for short — here at Swim Smooth we are big fans of CSS training! Threshold is an extremely important point in all endurance sports because it is fundamental to your physiology — if you can improve your fitness so that your threshold (and so CSS) is at a faster speed then you will race quicker in any distance event — even in ultra-distance events such as Ironman and marathon swimming. Other fitness factors such as your outright strength or your

physiology — if you can improve your fitness so that your threshold (and so CSS) is at a faster speed then you will race quicker in any distance event — even in ultra-distance events such as Ironman and marathon swimming. Other fitness factors such as your outright strength or your ability to sprint play an extremely minor part in distance races in comparison. ADAM: If you remember back to the 11-year-old girl story in the introduction to this book, you will recall how quickly she could swim despite having very low levels of outright strength. Here we have one of the main reasons to explain that — she has excellent aerobic fitness from training very consistently in her swim club. i.e. her CSS pace is high. Always remember that distance swimming performances are not about strength but aerobic fitness — it’s about sustaining a good pace for a long time, not sprinting very quickly over a short distance. You need to develop this aerobic fitness in your swimming muscle groups to become a great distance swimmer and CSS training should play a major role in doing that. Improving your CSS is the key to improving your performance in any distance freestyle event. Training at this pace doesn’t have to be a chore — it’s actually quite good fun! --- Page 198 Text --- PAUL: If you have used a power meter on a bike and read Coggan and Allen’s excellent book ‘Training with Power’ (2006) you will be familiar with using the concept of Functional Threshold Power (FTP) to measure your threshold on the bike in Watts.

using the concept of Functional Threshold Power (FTP) to measure your threshold on the bike in Watts. CSS is the exact same concept but for swimming. In the controlled environment of a swimming pool we don’t need something as fancy as a power meter to measure threshold, it can be defined as a pace per 100 m. As we shall see, rather than performing a 20-minute or 60-minute time trial to find FTP we perform two shorter swims in the pool and perform a calculation to find CSS pace. We recommend performing the CSS test approximately every four weeks to monitor fitness improvements. Once you know your CSS speed (say it is 1:40 / 100 m) you can then calculate your ideal training pace for endurance work (1:48 / 100 m) and for sprint training (1:35 / 100 m). Therefore as your fitness and CSS improves, your whole training plan adapts to keep pushing your fitness forwards. Combining CSS training with an outline skeleton structure (see Chapter 26) provides you with the perfect training routine that has the right mix of training levels, is flexible enough to handle life events and adapts to your fitness levels to keep pushing you forwards. In other words perfect training! Next we will take a look at the test you can use to find your current CSS pace and go on to show you some training sets you can use to improve that pace over time and so become a faster distance swimmer. The CSS Test Follow this procedure to conduct a CSS test: 1. Swim an easy warm-up of between 600 m and 1000 m, including a variety of technique drills and a few short efforts to lift your heart rate. 2. Perform a 400 m time trial from a push (not a

Perform a 400 m time trial from a push (not a dive), count your laps right and accurately time it! 3. Recover for 10—15 minutes, including some easy laps of swimming to clear waste products from your muscles. 4. Perform a 200 m time trial from a push, again with accurate timing. 5. Easy cool-down. --- Page 199 Text --- ADAM: Remember the anxiety you may feel at the mere mention of the words ‘time trial’! Try to relax during the two swims and see what happens without any preconceptions or pressure. Whatever your times just see them as a stake in the ground at that point in time, the whole idea is that you improve them from here. Some important notes: Remember the test is about your current fitness levels so do not feel tempted to skip the test and put your all-time 200 m and 400 m personal bests into the calculation, unless you have just swum them! Your efforts need to be a true and accurate reflection of what you can currently do for that distance in order to produce a valid CSS figure. Ideally have someone take your splits every 50 m to check your pacing and try to swim each 50 m within a second of the others. Remember that a well-paced effort will feel quite steady at first but build in perceived intensity as it goes on: steady — tempo — hard — very hard. Carefully check that your results make sense, for instance you should have held a faster pace over 200 m than

= 100 / CSS (m / sec) Your resultant CSS pace might at first glance appear a little easy for those of you with experience of interval training but remember that CSS is about a hard 1500 m pace. Certainly you could swim quicker than CSS in an intervals session with lots of recovery but CSS sets should be performed with short recoveries so that the training effects are focused on the energy systems used in distance swimming, not sprinting. Re-test your CSS pace approximately every four weeks to make sure that you are setting your training intensities properly and thus getting the best out of your training time. The ultimate goal is for your CSS pace to increase, if it does you are pretty much guaranteed to be swimming quicker in your races. This is even the case if you are racing in ultra-distance events that take place well below lactate threshold pace, this is --- Page 200 Text --- because the same energy systems are used at these slower paces too and from their enlarged capacity for work you will be able to sustain a faster pace for longer. Improving Your CSS The key to improving CSS is to perform sets with short recoveries with a strong focus on pacing them correctly. When you swim at your CSS pace the feeling is one of being ‘uncomfortably comfortable’ — it is hard work but you can sustain your technique and speed throughout a training set. It is very important that you do not start these sets too fast and then blow-up! Here are four example CSS sets: 1. 20 × 100 m with 15 s recovery between each. 2. 10 × 200 m with 20 s recovery between each. 3. 5 × 400 m with 30 s recovery between

pace + 6—10 sec per 100 m. 20 km: CSS pace + 10—20 sec per 100 m (factoring in feed stops of 20—30 sec every 25 minutes or so). English Channel (38 km): CSS pace + 20—30 sec per 100 m (factoring in feed stops of 20—30 sec every 25 minutes or so). Of course you also need to train your endurance sufficiently to maintain these paces over the longer swims! Don’t I Need to Swim Faster than My CSS Pace to Improve it? You will have noticed that CSS training sets are swum at current CSS pace in order to become faster. For many swimmers this seems counter-intuitive, going against the commonly held belief that the key to becoming faster is to ‘train at a much faster pace and my body will get used to it’. Unfortunately this logic is flawed because the body does not work like that. When you train significantly faster than threshold you end up splitting the training effect into your anaerobic system too — which you don’t need to develop as a distance swimmer. You also give your body a much greater recovery task after the session, which means it has less energy left over to make the fitness adaptations you are looking for. The end result is that training significantly above CSS pace gives you less development of your threshold speed. Coaches Martin and Gabby explain the importance of correct pacing prior to a CSS set. --- Page 202 Text --- The research by MacLaren and Coulson [4] backs this up, demonstrating that threshold-paced training significantly develops CSS but much harder paced anaerobic sprint training often results in a slowing of CSS pace. Still not convinced? Compare this form of training to weight training. Say you wanted to increase your maximum bench press.

by MacLaren and Coulson [4] backs this up, demonstrating that threshold-paced training significantly develops CSS but much harder paced anaerobic sprint training often results in a slowing of CSS pace. Still not convinced? Compare this form of training to weight training. Say you wanted to increase your maximum bench press. You can currently lift 50 kg and want to get to 60 kg. You can’t go and lift 60 kg — you’re not strong enough. But by doing sets at 45—50 kg your body adapts and improves. To stress a body system and prompt an adaptation you just need to approach your current limit or threshold. Many Masters swim sessions do focus on short, sharp speed sets as their swimmers will be competing in pool-based sprint events. If you are a triathlete or longer distance pool or open water swimmer, you need to be wary of doing too many high intensity intervals at the expense of more steady-state CSS work. Unfortunately, many view these longer, harder sets as dull or even antisocial but when faced with limited training time you need to be assured that the work that you are doing is paying the biggest dividends. Once you get into the swing of CSS work you will find it challenging and be motivated as a result, especially when you see your performances improve. Gathering a few friends together to swim these sets always makes things more enjoyable and is highly recommended. So, No More Sprint Training? You can certainly still include some anaerobic work and short sprints in your training — they’re good for your swimming technique in themselves: they give you a ‘feel for the water’ at higher speeds and they train your nervous system to recognise the higher forces associated with producing greater power output. Sprint races can

include some anaerobic work and short sprints in your training — they’re good for your swimming technique in themselves: they give you a ‘feel for the water’ at higher speeds and they train your nervous system to recognise the higher forces associated with producing greater power output. Sprint races can also be a lot of fun between friends and should not be discounted because they are not specific to distance swimming. What we are suggesting is that you shift your key training sets away from anaerobic sprint sessions to CSS work if you are focusing on events over 400 m. In practice this means slowing the pace a touch and shortening the recoveries — making the speed more sustained. Pacing Your CSS Sets Correctly Think of your CSS pace as a single reference point from which all your other training paces are calculated. In the training sets in Appendix C we use this principle, giving you a target pace for different sets in reference to your CSS pace. For example a simple endurance set for a swimmer with a CSS of 1:40 / 100 m is: 1000 m at CSS pace + 10s per 100 m, i.e. 1:50 / 100 m 800 m at CSS pace + 8s per 100 m, i.e. 1:48 / 100 m 600 m at CSS pace + 6s per 100 m, i.e. 1:46 / 100 m 400 m at CSS pace + 4s per 100 m, i.e. 1:44 / 100 m --- Page 203 Text --- 200 m at CSS pace + 2s per 100 m, i.e. 1:42 / 100 m PAUL: Using one of these devices in this manner is quite an experience, it is like swimming against the red World Record line that follows swimmers up and down the pool at the Olympics.

--- 200 m at CSS pace + 2s per 100 m, i.e. 1:42 / 100 m PAUL: Using one of these devices in this manner is quite an experience, it is like swimming against the red World Record line that follows swimmers up and down the pool at the Olympics. It has a nagging habit of catching you up if you set off too fast! You will have noticed by now that these paces are very specific and would make pacing them using a watch or pool clock quite difficult. The solution to that problem is to use a Wetronome or Tempo Trainer Pro, which are beepers that you place under your swimming cap. In lap-interval mode they can be set to beep at the exact pace that you want to be holding, for instance 1:40 / 100 m pace is 25 seconds per 25 m. So by setting the device to beep to you every 25 seconds you can pace your swim to be at the end of the 25 m lap (or half lap in a 50 m pool) when it beeps. This gives you an amazing control over your swim pacing and greatly simplifies the process, allowing you to switch off and concentrate on your swimming and holding good form — these beepers make the perfect virtual training partner for your CSS sessions. Confusing CSS Test Results From time to time you might get some unexpected results from the CSS calculation, especially if you are comparing results from different swimmers. The most common of these is where one swimmer has faster 200 m and 400 m time trial results than another but ends up with a slower CSS — which at first sight seems very strange. To understand this result we must remember that CSS pace is

absolutely essential. Besides the necessity to train at a pace appropriate to your race distance, the biggest skill you will develop is the ability to control and manage your effort over time. In the heat of a squad session, pacing can go straight out of the window as swimmers try frantically to keep up with the person in front of them. In our Perth Swim Smooth squad sessions, the leader of each lane is instructed to use a beeper under their swim cap set at the right target pace for the lane, all the other swimmers in the lane have to do is set off five seconds behind the swimmer in front and maintain that gap. This takes the pressure out of these types of sessions and encourages the lane to work together as a team, each happy to take their turn at the front with the beeper. Whilst it sounds simple to maintain a given swimming pace, in practice all sorts of things can affect how well you develop this skill, not least your competitive urge and the notion that a training session should feel hard from the very first lap for you to maximise the benefit from it. Instead of this, think of a CSS session as part training, part technique — the technique being your ability to pace things out well. The two go hand in hand: by sticking to your goal pace accurately you will maximise the training effect of your session.

that over 90% of all endurance world records for running (track) and swimming (pool) have been achieved through perfectly even pacing or with a ‘negative split’ — i.e. finishing faster than you started? Pace judgement is an absolutely essential skill for great distance swimming and with CSS training you will really start to develop yours. Watches such as the Finis SwimSense, the Garmin 310XT (and the newer 910XT) and the Swimovate Pro can help you monitor your pacing consistency. You will need a GPS device such as the Garmin to monitor pace in open water. In the future we expect this technology to keep evolving becoming ever more accurate and cheaper too. --- Page 206 Text --- Developing Pace Awareness in the Open Water In the pool you can easily monitor your swimming pace and your strokes per length to assess your consistency but in open water neither of these variables is easily measured. Elite open water swimmers do monitor one metric though to ensure some consistency and that is stroke rate — how many strokes they take per minute. Normally this information is fed to the swimmer from a coach on a support boat and in general the target is to avoid stroke rate dropping by more than 10% over the course of a race. Every swimmer has their own unique stroke rate that they can sustain. As an extreme example of how consistent an elite swimmer can be, Shelley Taylor-Smith (seven-time World Marathon Swimming Champion) held 88 SPM (strokes per minute) for a distance of 70 km from Sydney to Wollongong (Australia) only varying by ±5% over this epic 12-hour challenge. Amazing! Probably the biggest single difference between an amateur and a professional endurance athlete is their ability to feel exactly what level of perceived exertion they are

pace for reasons out of your control. By getting to know your body better and knowing exactly what level of fitness you have in the pool at any point in time, you can improve your ability to judge the right pace whatever the external influences. The key to good pacing is the pace you set in the first 20% of your race when you are fresh, this will ultimately determine how successful you are in that event. The more refined and developed your innate pace judgement, the more accurate you will be at pacing this first section of the race. PAUL: In my training for my English Channel swim in September 2011 I used a Garmin 310XT GPS device under my swim cap in all my open water sessions so that I could assess my ability to hold a straight line in the open water and to see how far and fast I’d actually swum. Whilst I couldn’t see this data as I was swimming, I did use the Garmin to beep at me every 500 m which kept me focused on just the next seven minutes of swimming rather than thinking about the very long training session as a whole. When the Garmin was downloaded, I could clearly see how well I’d been pacing myself and whether or not I needed to make any changes to my pacing for future sessions. It was a brilliant tool to use and one which I can highly recommend! --- Page 207 Text --- Tracking data recorded by the Garmin 310XT and 910XT software is extremely useful for assessing your performances in open water.

One of the most frequently asked questions at the end of our full-day Swim Smooth Clinics is ‘do you recommend gym training for swimmers and triathletes?’ Our answer is that it depends, mostly on whether you have enough time available in your week. In an ideal world we would all be full-time athletes with access to well-equipped gyms and physiotherapy, pilates and even yoga classes.

be full-time athletes with access to well-equipped gyms and physiotherapy, pilates and even yoga classes. In this situation you would definitely benefit from such conditioning work to help you become a more balanced athlete but in reality most of us are time-strapped and the danger of introducing significant conditioning work to your programme is that you would have to cut back on the swimming itself to fit it in. With this in mind we have designed a flexibility and conditioning routine that you can complete quickly and efficiently both before and after swim training or even in front of the TV! What is Dry-Land Training? Dry-land training can be loosely categorised into three main areas: 1. Flexibility and mobility. 2. Core stability and rehabilitation. 3. Strength training. PAUL: Dry-land training derived its name from the fact that many of the world’s elite swim programmes would engage their swimmers in conditioning exercises on the pool deck immediately before and after training in the water. Australian swimming legend Ian Thorpe was famous for arriving at training 30 minutes prior to every session to work on his mobility and flexibility. This extra conditioning work has often been cited as one of the reasons why he was so successful in winning multiple Olympic Gold Medals. Whilst we will probably never reach the same levels of flexibility and conditioning that elite swimmers have, making improvements in important areas can help you make large improvements to your stroke technique. 1. Flexibility and Mobility --- Page 210 Text --- When it comes to swimming, a big limiting factor for many triathletes is a lack of flexibility.

Text --- When it comes to swimming, a big limiting factor for many triathletes is a lack of flexibility. Poor flexibility can give rise to many stroke technique flaws including crossovers, dropped elbows and sinking legs, all of which will severely limit your potential in the water. Swim, bike and run training keeps us very busy but improving your flexibility doesn’t have to eat into your training time, you can make some big improvements by performing a stretching routine in front of the TV in the evening. In particular, triathletes and swimmers needs to focus on the following areas when stretching: Upper back / shoulders. Hips. Ankles. Studies show that to avoid injury athletes should either stretch regularly or not at all [1] — it tends to be those athletes who stretch every now and again that experience issues with muscle injury and strains. For this reason you should keep stretching regularly to avoid injury and always warm up properly beforehand. Think of your muscles and tendons as a little like toffee — when cold they are brittle and subject to micro-tears if over-stretched, with some gentle mobilisation and warming up they become a lot more pliable. Stretching prior to a training session should only be used to gently loosen off and not to develop muscle length or range of motion. Such work is best left until after training or in a specific stretching session where you warm up beforehand. Stretches should never be painful and should never use a bouncing action. Aim to hold each stretch for approximately 20 seconds and repeat each two to three times. Practise deep controlled breathing while stretching. Stretching: Upper Back and Shoulders Doorway Chest Stretch. Standing in a doorway or beside a post, place your arm in the position shown with your elbow

bouncing action. Aim to hold each stretch for approximately 20 seconds and repeat each two to three times. Practise deep controlled breathing while stretching. Stretching: Upper Back and Shoulders Doorway Chest Stretch. Standing in a doorway or beside a post, place your arm in the position shown with your elbow at a right angle. Gently press forwards with your chest and feel the stretch across the front of your shoulder and through the pectoral (chest) muscle. Avoid pushing the shoulder itself too far forward — instead think of drawing your shoulder blades together and back. --- Page 211 Text --- Telescope Arms and Rotation Stretch. This looks complicated but is easy when you get the hang of it! Start by lying on your side with knees bent to approximately 90° and one hand on top of the other. Take a deep breath in and as you exhale rotate the top arm all the way over to open yourself out into a crucifix position whilst following the arm with your gaze. Take a few deep breaths in this position and feel your back and shoulders sinking into the ground with every exhale. This fantastic stretch develops your chest, shoulder and back mobility all in one. Take care to perform it in a slow controlled manner and do not attempt it if you have had any major back problems in the past. --- Page 212 Text --- Triceps and Lats Stretch. Place your hand behind your head and lean to the side into a wall or against a post. Relax into the position and feel the stretch through your triceps and lat muscles. Forward Lean Shoulder Stretch.

into a wall or against a post. Relax into the position and feel the stretch through your triceps and lat muscles. Forward Lean Shoulder Stretch. Whilst kneeling, lean forwards with your hands extended out in front of each shoulder. Feel the stretch through the shoulders and chest and underneath the armpits. Hip Flexor Stretch. A lot of time spent sitting at a desk and training on the bike can result in the hip flexor muscles at the front of the hip becoming short. When trying to maintain a horizontal position in the water to reduce drag, this tightness in the hips can pull your legs forward and lower in the water. Regular stretching of the hip flexors will help improve your body position in the water. Settle into the position shown with your lead leg angled 90 degrees at the knee and your rear leg stretched out behind you. Keeping your body vertical and strong, gently push your hips forward and gently squeeze your glutes (your buttock muscles). You will feel the stretch through the front of the hip and possibly into the quadriceps. As a triathlete, think of this as one of your key stretches. --- Page 213 Text --- Seated Ankle Stretch. In the Swim Smooth squads in Perth, we perform very few kick sets with our triathletes, preferring instead to perform drills using a pair of longer flexible flippers, which help to stretch off your ankles. This is a very good use of your time as you develop your stroke using a specific drill and stretch your ankles simultaneously. Outside of the pool you can also use the two stretches shown to assist in stretching off your ankles. Left: Sit on the floor with one leg extended in front and the other bent across the top. Hold

little and often is best. Calf stretch (right). Crouch down with foot kept flat on the floor and the other pointing back underneath you. Keep your body weight over the foot which is flat on the ground and feel the stretch through the lower calf muscle (soleus). 2. Core Stability and Rehabilitation In Chapter 10 we looked at how you could improve your use of your upper core (shoulders / upper back) and lower core (lower back / abdominal) muscle groups to improve your posture whilst swimming. Here are a few key exercises that you can use at home or in the gym to improve your general conditioning in these areas. Given that core stabilisation training initially requires some skill in order for you to feel the correct muscles activating, we would highly recommend seeking the assistance of a personal trainer or physiotherapist to take you through these exercises. Core stability became very popular in the mid to late 1990s together with an increasing interest in pilates, yoga and the combined ‘yogilates’. Core stability is the interaction of coordination and strength of the abdominal, back and glute muscles during activity to ensure that the spine is stabilised and provides a firm base to support both basic and powerful everyday movements of the arms and legs. Core stability training is an essential component of sport performance and plays a key role in injury prevention. The core muscles are the deepest layer of muscles within the torso and include the abdominals, lower back, buttock and hip muscles, which surround --- Page 215 Text --- the pelvis. Developing a solid foundation within your torso will then allow you to generate powerful movements from your trunk outwards. In a nutshell, core stability: Improves posture.

back, buttock and hip muscles, which surround --- Page 215 Text --- the pelvis. Developing a solid foundation within your torso will then allow you to generate powerful movements from your trunk outwards. In a nutshell, core stability: Improves posture. Maintains healthy and balanced muscles. Enhances physical functioning in everyday activities (‘Functional Fitness’). Facilitates powerful movements such as those executed during sport. Helps to protect joints and muscles from injury. Neutral Spine The idea of a neutral spine relates to setting your trunk before you begin a core stability programme. By finding your neutral spine position you are activating the key core muscles within your torso, which need to be ‘turned on’ prior to executing coordinated movements. Here’s how: 1. Start by lying flat on your back on a mat or comfortable carpeted floor with your knees bent. 2. Place your arms by your sides so that your elbows are straight and your shoulders relaxed. 3. Slowly take three deep breaths in and out to try and release any stress and relax your body. 4. Gently and slowly tilt your pelvis so that you are flattening your back into the floor. Avoid lifting your buttocks. Try to isolate the movement so that only your pelvis is moving. 5. Now tilt your pelvis in the opposite direction so that you are arching your lower back. Again try to keep the movement isolated to your pelvis. 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 a few more times. By tilting your pelvis you are performing what is called an anterior pelvic tilt (arch back) and a posterior pelvic tilt (flatten back). 7. Now to locate your neutral spine, find the middle position between flattening and arching your back. Here are four simple exercises that you can use to improve your core conditioning: Controlled Roll

performing what is called an anterior pelvic tilt (arch back) and a posterior pelvic tilt (flatten back). 7. Now to locate your neutral spine, find the middle position between flattening and arching your back. Here are four simple exercises that you can use to improve your core conditioning: Controlled Roll Ups Lie flat on your back on the floor, legs straight out in front of you placing your arms and hands by your sides. Gently and slowly lift your head off the floor and draw your lower stomach to spine as you slowly start to sit up. Slowly breathe in as you continue sitting up until you are straight, then pause. Begin rolling back down whilst breathing out. Start at your pelvis and slowly unfold your spine as you return to the starting position. Repeat 10—15 times. --- Page 216 Text --- Bridging Lie flat on your back, find your neutral spine and draw your lower stomach in. Slowly push down through your feet and lift your bottom right up so that your trunk is straight with your shoulders, hips and knees in a line. Breathe in as you lift and out as you lower, and hold the lift for 5—10 seconds thinking of squeezing your buttocks as you lift. Repeat 10—15 times. Wall Squats Standing with your back to the wall take one step away with both feet whilst keeping your back to the wall. Your toes should be in line and slightly turned out. Find your neutral spine position and draw your lower stomach in. Holding this position, slowly perform a half squat keeping your bottom against the wall. Hold the squat for five seconds and then lift to return to the start. Complete three sets of twelve squats. --- Page 217 Text --- Front Plank Place your

position and draw your lower stomach in. Holding this position, slowly perform a half squat keeping your bottom against the wall. Hold the squat for five seconds and then lift to return to the start. Complete three sets of twelve squats. --- Page 217 Text --- Front Plank Place your elbows on the floor shoulder width apart and directly under your shoulders. Supporting yourself on your elbows and toes, be sure your body is in a flat line with no dip or arch in your spine and with your bottom tucked in. Keep your spine neutral and draw in your lower stomach. Hold this position for 20—30 seconds and then rest for 30 seconds, repeating three times. As you get stronger challenge yourself by trying to hold the position for longer each time. The Y-T-W-L Here’s a dry-land exercise we have borrowed from physiotherapists to help you tune into drawing your shoulders together and back (technical term ‘scapular retraction’). We are sure you are familiar with the Village People’s hit song from the 1970s: ‘YMCA’. We are going to do the Y-T-W-L instead! --- Page 218 Text --- Standing in some space, draw your arms up into a Y position beside you. How do they naturally sit? Do they tend to lean forwards like Paul’s position on the left? Maintaining this position, focus on drawing your shoulder blades together and back and notice how your arms come back in line with the body. That’s good posture in action! Avoid arching your lower back as you do this. Run through each of the Y-T-W-L positions, holding each position for around ten seconds; the exercise gets progressively harder to stabilise through the four positions!

Run through each of the Y-T-W-L positions, holding each position for around ten seconds; the exercise gets progressively harder to stabilise through the four positions! The YTWL is a great exercise to add into any stretching and conditioning routine that you have in place. You can practise it immediately before a swim or even between sets in the shallow end of the pool. Over time the YTWL will give you a greater awareness of your posture and help you improve it. In Chapter 30 we will look at some more functional rehab-style exercises for the upper back and shoulders that will help to ward off shoulder injury. --- Page 219 Text --- 3. Strength Training in the Gym When considering introducing traditional gym strengthening exercises into your swimming programme we would encourage you to always ask the question ‘how specific is this exercise to my swimming?’. Swimming is not ordinarily limited by strength in the true sense of the word, which is probably best demonstrated by the example of the 11-year-old girl who so easily cruises past you in the pool and yet would never come close to matching your strength in the gym as an adult. Despite swimming not being limited by strength, some swimmers and triathletes like to add a gym strengthening programme to their routine during the winter months and we would not discourage you from doing so if you are seeking a little general conditioning and toning. We would, however, encourage you to avoid too much emphasis on lifting heavy weights, especially those focused on the muscles at the front of the shoulder and chest (e.g. shoulder and bench press). If performed excessively these exercises can limit mobility in the shoulders and also bring you into a rounded-shoulder posture

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
however, encourage you to avoid too much emphasis on lifting heavy weights, especially those focused on the muscles at the front of the shoulder and chest (e.g. shoulder and bench press). If performed excessively these exercises can limit mobility in the shoulders and also bring you into a rounded-shoulder posture that could harm your alignment in the pool. In fact, most swimmers and triathletes that we see who have a background in weight training are limited by those two factors: posture and mobility. If you are going to use the gym we suggest you focus your attention on the following exercises that will help maintain and improve your swimming posture: Barbell Row. This exercise focuses on the shoulder and scapular region muscle groups. Use a light weight for this exercise and keep the shoulder horizontal, aiming for 2—3 sets of 12—15 reps with each arm. Lat Pull Down. A great exercise for assisting with good posture and alignment of the upper back. Keep your spine straight when performing this exercise and keep the weight light. Aim for 2-3 sets of 15—20 reps. --- Page 220 Text --- Seated Upright Row. Another excellent exercise for helping you to focus on drawing your shoulder blades together and down when you swim.

Epub 2006 May 6. --- Page 222 Text --- CHAPTER 30 Prevention and Management of Shoulder Injuries Shoulder pain and injury is very common amongst freestyle swimmers and is caused by repetitive stress placed on the shoulders during each arm stroke. At least 80% of adult swimmers will experience some form of shoulder pain in their swimming lives and such pain should be taken very seriously so that it does not lead to a full-blown injury and time out from swimming. Most elite swimmers train for around 40-70 km per week, which adds up to well over two million strokes per year — that is an awful lot of potential stress on their shoulders. In fact, in elite swimming circles shoulder injury was so common that it used to be considered a fact of swimming life, just something they had to live with. Fortunately these days we understand that the stress on the shoulders is dramatically affected by stroke technique and that by correcting your technique we can greatly reduce stress on the joint, quickly reduce symptoms and go on to cure the condition.

we understand that the stress on the shoulders is dramatically affected by stroke technique and that by correcting your technique we can greatly reduce stress on the joint, quickly reduce symptoms and go on to cure the condition. An absolutely vital aspect of your preparation as a swimmer is consistency in your training; if you need time out of the water to recover from an injury you will lose the fitness gains that you would otherwise have achieved. For this reason if you suffer from any form of pain in your shoulders you need to take immediate corrective action using the advice in this chapter. Avoid shoulder injury at all costs, it will ruin the consistency of your training, which is absolutely key to your success as a swimmer. --- Page 223 Text --- Shoulder Injury Signs and Symptoms Shoulder injury may begin as mild pain in the shoulder, which is only felt when swimming but can quickly progress to moderate or severe pain felt while performing daily activities and while sleeping. Early on, symptoms will subside shortly after swimming; however, if there has been no period of rest or treatment, pain may come on sooner and persist with other activities involving shoulder movements. Common symptoms of swimming shoulder injury include pain, limited movement, a painful arc, muscle weakness, tenderness to touch, clicking noises or catching sensations. PAUL: I vividly recall a conversation I had with my long-term coach Chris Jones (former British Triathlon Head Coach) about one of the other junior athletes on the British Triathlon team with me at the time, Tim Don. Tim had just won the World Junior Triathlon Championships in 1998 and Chris had asked Tim about the factors involved in his success and his rise to prominence.

other junior athletes on the British Triathlon team with me at the time, Tim Don. Tim had just won the World Junior Triathlon Championships in 1998 and Chris had asked Tim about the factors involved in his success and his rise to prominence. Perhaps the key point that Tim highlighted was his consistency of training — he hadn’t picked up a single injury in the past three seasons. This, combined with an excellent and balanced training programme, had allowed him to lift his game and dominate the world junior triathlon scene — something I could only ever dream of! Thinking back to my own training in that period, my incidence of injury was quite high and my progress was constantly being stalled by time out from training. If there’s one thing guaranteed to help you improve, it’s consistent practice of correct training methods. Likewise, if there’s one thing guaranteed to throw a spanner in the works, it’s an injury! Please be super-proactive with your stroke technique to avoid injury, use pre- swimming exercises to loosen off before swimming and take a sensible approach to your overall training load. Don’t panic if you already have a shoulder injury, use the advice in this chapter to get it quickly under control. Pain can be felt in the top, front, side or back of the shoulder and may even radiate down the arm to the elbow. Swelling and torn tissue may also be present, however it is most likely this will only be seen by ultrasound examination.

seen by ultrasound examination. Take Immediate Action --- Page 224 Text --- As soon as you experience any shoulder pain or injury always seek medical advice from a physiotherapist, athletic therapist or sports doctor as soon as possible in order to determine the severity of the injury and to begin rehabilitation. Also immediately reduce or stop training to prevent the pain and swelling from continuing. Resting from activities or movements which aggravate pain is critical and applying ice to reduce inflammation is also key to a successful and fast recovery. Secondly, make sure that you address areas of your stroke technique that can be causing or aggravating the injury using the advice that follows in this chapter. Whilst rehabilitation is important, without addressing your stroke technique an injury could quickly return. Finally, as part of your rehabilitation, introduce the strengthening and stability exercises into your training programme so as to maintain muscle balance around your shoulder joint, which will help to maintain healthy strong shoulders and upper back. Before training always warm-up and stretch lightly but do not over-stretch your shoulders as too much flexibility can also be detrimental. What is the Cause of Shoulder Pain? Shoulder pain is commonly classified into three categories: 1. Shoulder Joint Impingement Shoulder Impingement is a compression or squashing of the structures within the top of the shoulder joint (subacromial space). Within this space lie muscular tendons (e.g. the rotator cuff), and the fluid filled sac that prevents muscle on bone traction (the subacromial bursa). Impingement arises due to the thickening or swelling of the structures within the space or upward migration of the ball in the shoulder joint, caused by having poor posture or poor biomechanics while swimming. 2. Overuse Injury Overuse injuries are generally defined as tendonopathies, which is where there is

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
Elements of each of these three patterns can coexist and are often interrelated. For example, a swimmer who has been diagnosed with a rotator cuff injury will experience pain, which prevents the muscles from working properly thereby allowing the ball (head of the humerus) to move more in the socket. Overall, the shoulder joint moves more than normal which can lead to laxity or instability of the shoulder. This laxity allows the ball to migrate upwards in the socket (glenoid fossa), which causes impingement or compression of the structures in the top of the shoulder. Many factors can cause shoulder injury. Broadly speaking these can be split into two key areas, both of which you should address to help prevent and rehabilitate sore shoulders: 1. Poor stroke technique and sudden increases in volume and/or intensity within your programme. 2. Poor posture and mobility in your neck and upper back as well as muscle imbalance around your shoulders. In the rest of this chapter we will look at each of these areas and how to address them to fix a shoulder problem. Shoulder Injury: Stroke Technique and Training The classic stroke technique flaws that cause shoulder injury are as follows, refer to Figure 30.20 to view pictures of them and how to correct them: --- OCR from Page 225 Image 1 --- plane Acromioclavicular ligament Clavicle Acromion of scapula + SMe Rotator cuff muscle SUBACROMIAL BURSA (supraspinatus) Head of humerus Tendon of biceps —— brachii muscle (long head) Humerus (ec) Frontal section --- Page 226 Text --- FIGURE 30.20 Common stroke technique flaws causing injury. --- OCR from Page 227 Image 2 --- He nil it | vt --- Page 228 Text --- A Thumb-First Entry into the Water To enter into the water thumb first (1) the swimmer must internally

section --- Page 226 Text --- FIGURE 30.20 Common stroke technique flaws causing injury. --- OCR from Page 227 Image 2 --- He nil it | vt --- Page 228 Text --- A Thumb-First Entry into the Water To enter into the water thumb first (1) the swimmer must internally rotate the shoulder, which reduces the subacromial space and places the rotator cuff muscles in a high-risk position. Ironically enough this hand entry had been taught for many years as a way of improving how smoothly the hand entered into the water. Whilst you might get away with this if you are 11 years old with good flexibility and rotation in your stroke, as adults we need to be much more careful and modify our strokes to use a fingertips-first entry as demonstrated by Miss Smooth (2). This will keep your shoulder in a much more neutral position. A Crossover Upon Hand Entry Evident in over 70% of the swimmers we work with, a midline crossover (3) has a similar effect to that of a thumb-first entry (squashing the front of the shoulder). If a crossover is combined with a thumb-first entry this will almost certainly lead to a shoulder injury. To straighten your hand entry, visualise the middle finger of each hand extending straight forward in front of the same shoulder, not across, as demonstrated by Miss Smooth (4). Poor Body Rotation Many swimmers who were taught to swim by the Red Cross in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s were taught that body rotation along the long axis of the spine was a bad thing and a waste of effort (5). Conversely in the 1990s there was a strong and concerted effort to encourage swimmers to rotate to a full 90° by ‘stacking their shoulders’. Neither method is correct

were taught that body rotation along the long axis of the spine was a bad thing and a waste of effort (5). Conversely in the 1990s there was a strong and concerted effort to encourage swimmers to rotate to a full 90° by ‘stacking their shoulders’. Neither method is correct but both still persist in some swimming programmes today. To avoid shoulder injury, good body rotation between 45° and 60° is essential on every stroke (not just when you are breathing) and aids the recovery phase of the freestyle stroke by allowing the arm to clear the surface of the water without excessive internal rotation of the shoulder. This is best demonstrated by the land-based exercises as listed in Chapter 11. To avoid shoulder injury and improve your stroke efficiency, aim for rotation along the central axis of the spine demonstrated by Miss Smooth (6). A Straight Arm Catch and Pull-Through A straight arm pull-through is another very common stroke flaw and is a precursor to shoulder injury in many cases. When the arm pulls through with a straight elbow (7) it --- Page 229 Text --- creates a large amount of force on the unstable and relatively weak shoulder and rotator cuff muscles. This is exacerbated if the swimmer trains with large hand paddles as they put further force through the shoulder when in a very compromised position. Large hand paddles have a bad reputation for causing injury for this reason, but it is not directly the fault of the paddle, it is poor technique combined with a large paddle that creates shoulder injury. In fact when used in moderation with a bent elbow pull (8), hand paddles carry a very low injury risk. An Excessive Flick at the Exit (Push) Phase Some coaches and swim programmes encourage their

the paddle, it is poor technique combined with a large paddle that creates shoulder injury. In fact when used in moderation with a bent elbow pull (8), hand paddles carry a very low injury risk. An Excessive Flick at the Exit (Push) Phase Some coaches and swim programmes encourage their swimmers to ‘finish strong’ at the back of the stroke by emphasising the push immediately prior to the hand exiting the water at the rear of the stroke. This causes the swimmer to hyper-extend the elbow (9) and excessively internally rotate the shoulder. As well as stressing the shoulder joint, the hyper-extension at the elbow can cause a condition called medial epicondylitis (‘Golfer’s Elbow’). Swimmers who overly lengthen their freestyle strokes are particularly susceptible to this condition. Instead of locking out straight, the arm should exit the water with a slight bend of around 150° at the elbow. The palm of the hand should be turned in slightly towards the thigh to complete the stroke smoothly (10). A Sudden Increase in Training Volume or Intensity It is very important that you do not suddenly increase the volume of your training by more than 5% to 10% per week. Sudden jumps in volume or training intensity can trigger shoulder injury, especially if any of the above stroke flaws are in place in your stroke. This should not put you off fitness training as part of a balanced programme but take care to build things up progressively, especially if you are suddenly inspired (as we hope you will be!) with the large variety of training sets in Appendix C. Other aspects to watch out for are adding too much pull buoy, paddles and bands work to your swimming sessions, especially if you have poor catch mechanics and limited body rotation in your

a progression move your arms over your head in a snow angel fashion to increase the stretch and lengthen out the muscles at the front of the shoulders (4). 2. Telescope Arms Referring to Figure 30.22 lie on your side with your knees and hips bent to 90° and your arms stretched out, one on top of the other at shoulder height. Begin the stretch by reaching your top hand past your bottom hand as though you are reaching toward the wall in front of you. Keeping your elbow straight and rotating from your trunk upwards (avoiding rolling your hips), reach your arm toward the ceiling and back toward the opposite wall as though you are carving an arc in the air. Your goal is to finish the stretch with your upper shoulder on the floor. Repeat four to six times on each side. FIGURE 30.22 Telescope Arms Exercise --- Page 232 Text --- 3. Scapular Setting Scapular setting is important to re-establish a more balanced position of the humeral head (ball) in the glenoid fossa (socket) thus improving your overall shoulder posture. Sitting upright in a comfortable chair, gently pull your chin in and open your chest. As you do so, imagine pulling the lower part of your shoulder blades together without arching your back or throwing your rib cage forwards. Only a 30%-40% effort should be used to perform this exercise and you should not feel any tension in your shoulder blades or neck. Keep breathing normally and aim to hold the position for 1-2 minutes until it becomes comfortable, then aim to hold it for longer periods during the day. FIGURE 30.23 Develop an improved posture using Scapular Setting. Do not overexaggerate the position and arch the lower back (right). --- Page 233 Text --- Repeat this

pull the band away from your mid-line pivoting at your elbow. Repeat three sets of 10-12 repetitions of this exercise. As a progression increase to 15-20 repetitions then increase the resistance by using a stronger theraband. FIGURE 30.26 External Shoulder Rotation Using Theraband. --- Page 237 Text --- CHAPTER 31 Pool Skills If you are considering joining a triathlon club or Masters swim squad to improve your swimming, the simple tips in this chapter will help you fit in more quickly. Joining a squad does not need to be a confronting experience and you will certainly find many other swimmers at a similar level to yourself all keen to improve their swimming. This can be very motivating and we would always recommend that swimmers and triathletes aim to do at least one squad session per week under the guidance of a coach. Squad Training and Lane Etiquette Here are our top 10 tips on surviving your first few squad sessions with correct lane etiquette: 1. Unless otherwise advised, use the pool clock to set off exactly five seconds behind the person in front of you. You should not try to catch them up, as whilst this gives you a draft and makes it feel easier, you are not then getting the best possible workout that you could and it can also annoy the person in front. The coach will announce when drafting is actively encouraged but normally keep your distance to allow everyone to perform at their best, especially on technique sets. 2. Always keep close to the lane rope and swim in the circular direction advised on the plaque at the end of the lane, either clockwise or anticlockwise. If there is no sign, observe what others are already doing in the lane and aim to replicate that —

technique sets. 2. Always keep close to the lane rope and swim in the circular direction advised on the plaque at the end of the lane, either clockwise or anticlockwise. If there is no sign, observe what others are already doing in the lane and aim to replicate that — here in Australia the convention is to always swim clockwise but in the UK lanes alternate clockwise and anticlockwise. Stay close to the lane rope and avoid swimming in the middle of the lane as this is when head-on collisions occur or accidental clashing of arms. 3. If someone is catching you up and you are aware that they wish to get past you, either pull tight in towards the lane rope so that they can overtake (but still keep swimming and reduce your speed a fraction) or better still, when you reach the end of the pool pull off to the side, stop and let them past. 4. Be vigilant when you are pushing off in the middle of a set — is someone coming up to the wall where you are to turn? If so, don’t push off immediately in front of them as this is somewhat rude. Let them past and then when it is clear jump into a spot behind them. 5. Aim to start each and every lap with a good torpedo push off, they really pay dividends for your posture and make you look quite the ‘pro’! --- Page 238 Text --- 6. When using fins or pull buoys, chances are that the speed or ‘pecking’ order of the lane may change.

using fins or pull buoys, chances are that the speed or ‘pecking’ order of the lane may change. If you know that you are particularly quick with fins on, don’t be afraid to ask to go in front of the person in front of you or even lead the whole lane. 7. Aim to pace yourself well, this is ultimately what keeps the lane flowing effectively and what makes the most out of your own practice time. 8. Aim to do your drill and technique work to the best of your ability, do not feel pressured to rush through this aspect of the session. A drill worth doing is a drill worth doing well — always remember that. 9. Try to keep all of your kit neatly organised on the pool deck — a mesh kit bag is highly advisable and prevents other swimmers mistakenly walking off or using your kit. Also, naming your kit in bold black marker is always worth doing! 10. Lastly, be nice to your fellow lane swimmers. It might be early in the morning or late at night and we can all be a little grumpy at these times but there’s never an excuse to get irritable with anyone in your lane. If there’s a problem, let the coach know or just diplomatically address it with your swimming buddy. Tumble Turns Tumble turns can take a bit of practice to master but with a few simple tips, you too can be flipping at the end of each length very effectively. Tumble turns save you time and also maintain the flow and rhythm of your stroke better than a touch turn but they are by no means compulsory in any squad session. Many swimmers worry about the disorientation of being upside down whilst trying to coordinate

diving into and that there are no foreign obstacles or other swimmers that might get in your way and cause you harm. There is a risk of neck and spinal injury from diving into any body of water but if the depth is greater than 1.8 m (6 ft) and you execute a shallow racing dive into clear water the biggest risk that you face is a painful and embarrassing ‘belly flop’. If learning to dive, always seek the assistance of a qualified instructor and if you feel at all uncomfortable it is advisable to give it a miss and try again another day. Referring to Figure 31.28 here are our key tips to performing a successful racing dive: FIGURE 31.28 The dive start. 1. In a race the starter will call you onto the blocks with a series of short, sharp whistles to quieten the crowd followed by a longer whistle to invite you to step up. 2. You can choose to go from the side of the pool or off the special dive blocks which feature at many competition pools. Being higher and angled slightly down at the front, blocks allow the swimmer to gain a little more height (and with it, --- Page 241 Text --- distance) when they dive, which can make for a cleaner entry into the water. You have three basic stances which you can try in order to ready yourself for a good dive: 1) the classic start — feet together and hands reaching either side of the feet as you fold yourself over at the waist; 2) the competition start — feet about shoulder width apart and hands reaching between the feet, using the lip of the block to pull up against and gain traction on the block and coil the body

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
reaching either side of the feet as you fold yourself over at the waist; 2) the competition start — feet about shoulder width apart and hands reaching between the feet, using the lip of the block to pull up against and gain traction on the block and coil the body like a tight spring; 3) the track start (shown) — a similar hand position as the classic start, but one foot is placed back in a similar stance to how a track runner might start — this will typically be your strongest leg. Experiment and see which gives you the fastest reaction time and power off the blocks. 3. The starter will start you off with the instruction ‘take your marks. . .’ and then follow with either a whistle, gun blast or a simple ‘go!’ 4. Keep your chin tucked into your chest and spring your arms out in front of you to form a streamlined torpedo whilst driving off the block with the legs aiming for both a little height and a good bit of distance. If you lift your head and look forward too much you will cause your legs to drop too low and you will hit the water stomach and chest first (the ‘belly flop’). Tucking your chin in too tightly and spearing the water at too great an angle will force you into a nose dive and send you too deep into the water. 5. Once in the water, keep your hands together and commence a powerful kick to maintain your speed before breaking out into your full stroke just as per any normal push-off. In our Swim Smooth Perth squad sessions we perform very little of the other three competitive strokes: butterfly, backstroke and breaststroke. Whilst these strokes can benefit your freestyle by

commence a powerful kick to maintain your speed before breaking out into your full stroke just as per any normal push-off. In our Swim Smooth Perth squad sessions we perform very little of the other three competitive strokes: butterfly, backstroke and breaststroke. Whilst these strokes can benefit your freestyle by developing better muscular balance across the body, if you are only swimming two or three times per week and training for a triathlon or open water swimming event, we would advise you to keep your training as specific as possible and focus on mastering the freestyle stroke. However, it is still useful to know some tips on performing the other three strokes and using them in your warm-ups, and particularly cool-downs, as a good way to vary your programme. Butterfly — often seen as the hardest competitive stroke, butterfly can be challenging because it requires excellent rhythm and timing, good flexibility and a strong leg kick. The stroke undulates around the short axis of the spine and in this respect is more similar to breaststroke than freestyle and backstroke. The best way of visualising a good butterfly stroke is to think of yourself moving through the water like a dolphin. Both arms work together above and below the water with a more rounded recovery than in freestyle — probably one of the reasons why many Swingers are good at butterfly! You do need to be cautious, however, as the lack of long axis rotation in butterfly can increase the load on your shoulders so you should limit the volume of butterfly in your programme. Performing butterfly with fins is a great way to develop a feel for the undulated action of the stroke, it can also tone up your midsection and when done gently can help to --- Page 242

on your shoulders so you should limit the volume of butterfly in your programme. Performing butterfly with fins is a great way to develop a feel for the undulated action of the stroke, it can also tone up your midsection and when done gently can help to --- Page 242 Text --- loosen off a tight lower back. The key to a good butterfly stroke is to ensure that as your head comes up out of the water to take a breath, you do this quickly and focus on getting your chin down onto your chest as quickly as you can. This will help the torso dive back down into the water and assist the arms with their recovery over the top of the surface. The key to butterfly is to breathe and then quickly drop your chin back down onto your chest. Backstroke — very similar to freestyle with respect to long axis rotation, backstroke is effectively the reverse of freestyle and is often used as a way of stretching out during a cool-down and working the muscles in the opposite direction. To be good at backstroke having a strong leg kick is essential. If you don’t have a strong kick and want to try some of the beneficial aspects of the stroke then try wearing a pair of fins. Another important feature of backstroke is to keep your head back. We often tell the children who we work with to imagine that they have to keep their noses in the air like a ‘posh’ person would walk around. This stops the common mistake of bringing the chin towards the chest, which causes the swimmer to sit up in the water and drop the legs and buttocks down low. Breaststroke — whilst used by many swimmers who cannot swim

in the air like a ‘posh’ person would walk around. This stops the common mistake of bringing the chin towards the chest, which causes the swimmer to sit up in the water and drop the legs and buttocks down low. Breaststroke — whilst used by many swimmers who cannot swim freestyle, breaststroke is actually the least economic and slowest stroke due to the width of the body cutting through the water during the wide ‘frog’ kick. The reason breaststroke is favoured by many swimmers is because of the ease of lifting the head out of the water to breathe. Coordinating breathing in the freestyle stroke can initially be quite daunting whereas breaststroke is significantly easier and for this reason is a very valid way of becoming accustomed to the water when starting out in swimming. One of the keys to a great backstroke is to make sure your head is pushed back into the water. --- Page 243 Text --- Good breaststrokers often have very good hip flexibility, which helps with the angles required to gain a propulsive kick. The key to a good breaststroke is good coordination between the arms and legs and to aim to reduce the frontal profile by not pulling or kicking too wide. A simple focal point for developing a better breaststroke is to focus on snapping your elbows into your sides as you pull through and then driving your arms forwards in as sleek a motion as you possibly can. Try visualising scooping out a bowl of cake mix with your hands as they pull through to develop this motion! A fast breaststroke uses a snappy arm movement, returning to the front of the stroke as soon as possible. Individual Medley — Swimmers can bring all four competitive strokes together and perform an Individual

a bowl of cake mix with your hands as they pull through to develop this motion! A fast breaststroke uses a snappy arm movement, returning to the front of the stroke as soon as possible. Individual Medley — Swimmers can bring all four competitive strokes together and perform an Individual Medley (‘IM’) which consists of 25 m, 50 m or 100 m of each stroke in succession without stopping in the following order: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle. If performed as part of a medley relay team with three other --- Page 244 Text --- swimmers, the order of the strokes is slightly different: backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, freestyle. For more experienced swimmers, completing a 400 m IM always proves to be a good challenge and is worth swimming every now and then to spice up your training regime. The Most Important Walk in Swimming It might be as little as 10 metres but the walk from the changing rooms to the pool can really define your swimming. If you’ve been learning freestyle or working on improving your stroke then you should feel proud of yourself. Most people in the world cannot swim and many in the Western world do absolutely no exercise at all. You may not be the fastest swimmer in the world but that is absolutely fine thank you — so start walking out onto the pool deck tall and proud. Like your mum used to say: ‘head up, shoulders back, chest forwards!’ A final tip: guys, don’t forget to shave that 5 o’clock shadow before you swim! Adopting some positive body language and being confident in what you are doing will make a real difference when you start swimming.

to shave that 5 o’clock shadow before you swim! Adopting some positive body language and being confident in what you are doing will make a real difference when you start swimming. For one thing it will improve the positivity and rhythm in your stroke, which can only be good for your technique. And, if you can carry forward that shoulders-back posture into your stroke you will start to ‘Swim Proud’, which is great for your alignment in the water. --- Page 245 Text --- CHAPTER 32 Nutrition for Longer Sessions and Races At Swim Smooth we are often asked questions about what food and drink swimmers and triathletes should be using when they train and race to keep themselves fuelled and hydrated. Getting this aspect of your training preparation right is very important and will also determine how well you perform in training sessions and how quickly you recover afterwards. Studies have shown the negative effects of dehydration on performance as being anything upwards of 20% and if you have ever depleted your energy strokes and ‘hit the wall’ whilst you have been training you will know the profound effect that this also has. Whilst we believe in a balanced wholefood diet outside of your training and racing, here are a few tips on what you can do immediately before, during and after training to supplement your fuel stores and maintain your hydration levels. We have written our advice on this as a direct response to an email we received recently from one of our swimmers who is contemplating the challenge of the 20 km Rottnest Channel Swim in February 2012: Hi Paul, I have been doing the Saturday morning set the last three weeks with Stu and Clare and feel like I am pretty close to running on empty

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
recently from one of our swimmers who is contemplating the challenge of the 20 km Rottnest Channel Swim in February 2012: Hi Paul, I have been doing the Saturday morning set the last three weeks with Stu and Clare and feel like I am pretty close to running on empty after about 4 k. You mentioned using carbohydrate gels in one of the sessions last week — would it just be one of those after 3 or 4 km? In terms of fluids — just water or a Gatorade or similar? Would you recommend anything before a 5—7 k swim — bananas, muesli bar?? Where do you get the carbohydrate gels? Cheers, Chris There are a couple of things worth pointing out with respect to training and racing nutrition to fully answer this question Chris: 1. When training early in the morning your body has slept for 6—8 hrs and whilst this requires less energy than when you are awake, you still do burn calories whilst asleep. Although some swimmers prefer training on a totally empty stomach, we highly recommend having something before training to top up your muscle and liver glycogen stores. I personally have ‘Weet-bix’ cereal with hot milk and a sprinkle of sugar washed down with a vitamin drink, which I find works really well. Other people might have a banana, muesli bar or some toast and honey or --- Page 246 Text --- jam. I will often sip on a bottle of water on my way to the pool to top up my hydration levels. Food, food, glorious food! A collection of possible food and carbohydrate drink mixes for your training and racing. 2.

to the pool to top up my hydration levels. Food, food, glorious food! A collection of possible food and carbohydrate drink mixes for your training and racing. 2. Your body typically stores enough fuel in the form of carbohydrate (glycogen) to last you through 1½—2 hrs of moderate to hard intensity training. In general you want to avoid becoming depleted so it’s important that you top-up your energy during any session lasting over an hour. When you exercise very lightly you use a larger portion of stored fat as your fuel source but as soon as intensity starts to lift above 70—75%, an ever greater share of your fuel source starts to come from carbohydrates. Given that this session is long (5+ km) and it becomes progressively faster, it has the potential to be a real drain on your glycogen stores. As you get fitter, the body becomes better equipped for utilising stored fat as a fuel source but your pacing in the first 1—2 km of a hard set like this is important as well — go off too fast and you will immediately start draining your carbohydrate stores which will leave you wanting later in the session or race. 3. Personally I alternate between drinking 250 ml of Gatorade (mixed into the recommended 6—8% solution) every 25 minutes with 250 ml of Gatorade or water together with a carbohydrate gel like a GU. Some say you should never ingest a gel and Gatorade together (or similar carbohydrate rich drink) as the sugar solution might be too strong in your stomach and can cause gastro-intestinal problems. Whilst this is true for some, it’s not true for everyone — which is why you should use your training sessions as a way of experimenting with what works best for you. My

drink) as the sugar solution might be too strong in your stomach and can cause gastro-intestinal problems. Whilst this is true for some, it’s not true for everyone — which is why you should use your training sessions as a way of experimenting with what works best for you. My little formula gives me 500 ml of fluid per hour plus 30 g carbohydrate from the Gatorade and 25 g from the gel (55 g total). This is somewhat lower than the standard recommendation often made to triathletes of 1g / kg / hr (75 g per hour for someone of my size) plus 600-1000ml of fluid per hour. I’ve always found the greater total fluid and fuel volume more of a source of stomach upset than combining a gel together with Gatorade, but as I say this is highly individual and something to test out thoroughly yourself. --- Page 247 Text --- 4. These days carbohydrate sports gels can be bought at many sports stores or online. Whilst I use Gatorade most often as my drink source (because of its wide availability in supermarkets) other brands offer more sophisticated carbohydrate drinks too. ‘Pure Sport’ is a drink that we’re currently trialling (as used by Mr Michael Phelps himself). This contains a little protein as well as carbohydrates and electrolytes — the carbohydrates are for fuel, the electrolytes are to replace lost minerals through sweat, and the protein is to enhance recovery and reduce muscle damage. Other good brands include Powerade, Science In Sport and Powerbar. 5. Not everyone likes to consume a gel due to the texture, so experimenting with things like Powerbars, cereal bars, honey sandwiches and bananas are also a worthwhile thing to do to find out what works best for you, albeit they are generally harder

and 35 minutes to see what works best. In a pool session when you are not swimming continuously it is advisable to have a water bottle for little sips in between your major fuel stops. 7. If you finish a session completely drained of fuel then it’s going to take you a much longer time to recover. We get fitter (and faster) through a good balance of hard work and recovery. Take too long recovering between sessions and you will feel much less energetic at your next session. Consequently you always end up performing below par and never see the big improvements. This is why fuelling is so essential for effective training. 8. Aiming to get in 20—30 g of carbohydrates immediately after a long session like this will really pay dividends — a Nutella sandwich is always a favourite for me within 20 minutes of finishing a tough session. Things like Sustagen drinks are also a good way of recovering post session too. This is certainly not an exhaustive section on sports nutrition but the take home points are: don’t skip on nutrition, experiment with what works best for you and don’t forget to consume some carbohydrate rich foods immediately after training to aid rapid recovery and reduce the urge to snack on fatty foods later in the day. --- Page 248 Text --- KEY 3 Open Water Skills, tactics and stroke adaptations for swimming in open water --- Page 249 Text --- CHAPTER 33 The Importance of Open Water Skills When discussing open water events with swimmers, one of the most frequently asked questions we are asked is: ‘What time do you predict I can do for open water swim X?’ As we saw in Chapter 27, knowing your current level of swim specific fitness (your CSS pace)

Water Skills When discussing open water events with swimmers, one of the most frequently asked questions we are asked is: ‘What time do you predict I can do for open water swim X?’ As we saw in Chapter 27, knowing your current level of swim specific fitness (your CSS pace) is a key predictor of your performance for distance swimming in the pool. However, knowing this threshold pace will only give you a guesstimate of what you might be capable of in the open water. Swimming well in the open water requires you to be proficient in a wide variety of areas within swimming including: Managing anxiety and the feelings of claustrophobia that can come from the ‘washing machine’ effect at the start of a race. Sighting and the ability to swim straight between marker buoys. Drafting faster swimmers for improved times or with swimmers of similar ability for less energy expenditure. Turning and improving your speed around buoys with maintenance of good rhythm and momentum. Effective wetsuit swimming by adapting your stroke to work with, not against, the rubber of the suit. Strategies to adapt to a variety of open water conditions, both technically and psychologically. In an effort to constantly refine your technical capabilities in the pool it is very easy to forget about honing your open water skills until the start of the summer race season. However, to swim effectively in open water these skills need to be developed and refined all year round with just as much priority as traditional stroke technique work. This can be done very effectively — whilst having a lot of fun — in the pool during the winter months. As we shall see, developing these skills in the controlled environment of a pool is easier in many regards than in an

much priority as traditional stroke technique work. This can be done very effectively — whilst having a lot of fun — in the pool during the winter months. As we shall see, developing these skills in the controlled environment of a pool is easier in many regards than in an open water environment. Working on improvements in your stroke mechanics is very important and you can certainly make significant gains in this area in the pool. However, studies have shown that an effective drafting technique can save you up to 38% of your energy expenditure [1]. This is a staggering saving and to be honest one that you would struggle to match by improving your stroke mechanics alone, at least in the short term. If you add into that equation further improvements in handling anxiety, sighting, navigation skills and the ability to swim straight without a black line, then you can --- Page 250 Text --- understand why Swim Smooth is so passionate about giving your open water skills the attention they deserve all year round. What’s more, developing these skills can be a lot of fun and help to break the monotony of following the black line endlessly up and down the pool. PAUL: Here in Perth we run an open water skills session once a week all year round. This takes places on a Saturday lunch time and is a favourite session of local triathletes and open water swimmers — even in the middle of winter. We have a lot of fun and it’s personally my favourite session of the week to coach!

a lot of fun and it’s personally my favourite session of the week to coach! Age-group triathletes are particularly time poor as they must split their training time between three sports, around a full time job and having a healthy family life too. This shortage of time in the water makes it even more critical to focus on the right things when you are training. If you are a time strapped triathlete looking to improve your swim performances, make sure that you practise your open water skills regularly, ideally at least once a week. ADAM: During every Swim Smooth Clinic we run we ask swimmers if they regularly practise their stroke technique by working on appropriate drills in the pool. Nearly every hand is raised — great! But when asked who practises their open water skills regularly, very few hands go up. This highlights a real imbalance in most swimmers’ approach to the sport — don’t make this mistake yourself! Open Water vs. Pool Swimming A small plea from us: never be sold on the illusion that swimming in the pool is exactly the same as swimming in the open water. The fact is that the two can be incredibly different. The contrast is akin to road cycling on smooth flat asphalt, versus a technically challenging and hilly mountain bike trail. Make a commitment to get better at all of these skills at any time in the season and you’ll be translating and adapting your smooth freestyle pool stroke more efficiently to a variety of conditions in the open water. In the next six chapters we show you how. Just like swimming in the pool? The Indian Ocean was pancake flat before this Ironman swim start. --- Page 251 Text --- Reference 1. Chatard, J.-C., and B.

tackling anxieties is working out what it is that specifically brings on an attack — for example it could be swallowing some water and fearing you’re going to choke or perhaps losing your orientation and sense of direction. Other common triggers can be the cold itself, fear of the deep, fear of marine life or swimming into reeds. The reasons will be very personal to you and your circumstances. During the anxiety of an open water swim start it is essential that you block out everything around you and focus just on yourself. --- Page 253 Text --- 2. Become Selfish. When you’re training in the pool and thinking about your technique, you’re only ever concerned about yourself and how well you’re performing the exercise. The environment is calm and controlled and you can go about your task easily. As soon as you enter open water that calm internal focus can be rapidly replaced with thinking about external factors which are out of your control such as other swimmers, waves, fish, the thought of touching something, etc. A key skill for swimming well in open water is to block out those thoughts and return your focus on to you, your stroke and your breathing. We call this ‘becoming a selfish swimmer’! 3. Use Cue Words. Often referred to as mantras, repeating cue words such as ‘relax’, ‘breathe’, ‘control’, ‘smooth’ can help keep you focused on the here and now of each stroke rather than letting your mind wander to things out of your control. One of our best teaching mantras that also works well in the open water is ‘breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe’ as outlined in Chapter 7. Give it a try — simplicity of focus is key in the open water. 4. Practise With Friends. Any time you go for a swim

side kicking drills and visualisation in Appendix A to improve your swimming posture and alignment in the water. Also shift your focus when breathing back to the alignment of your lead hand; to do this you might count each stroke by repeating to yourself ‘1-2- straight-1-2-straight’ where the word ‘straight’ coincides with your breathing stroke. 2. Bilateral Breathing and Frequency of Sighting We are big fans of bilateral breathing at Swim Smooth for the simple reason that it naturally helps maintain the symmetry of your stroke and so helps you swim straighter in open water. Even if you only treat bilateral breathing as a training practice you then have the choice of either side to breathe to unilaterally whilst racing. We have heard some swimming coaches state that you should only ever breathe to one side in open water as this gives you a greater oxygen uptake. This makes sense, however, usually the reason swimmers start to feel starved of oxygen is due to the fact that they are not exhaling properly into the water between breaths. By improving their exhalation such swimmers find it much easier to breathe bilaterally even at racing levels of effort. Also, as we mentioned earlier, holding onto your breath is never a good idea as it can bring on anxiety attacks followed by hyperventilation. Sighting technique sequence: lift your head just enough to sight forwards and then breathe to the side. --- Page 257 Text --- Many unilateral breathers accept the fact that they might lose stroke symmetry and swim off course as a result; to counter this they sight forwards more frequently to correct their course. The problem with this solution is that sighting carries an energy cost of its own as you have to lift your head to breathe which sinks your

might lose stroke symmetry and swim off course as a result; to counter this they sight forwards more frequently to correct their course. The problem with this solution is that sighting carries an energy cost of its own as you have to lift your head to breathe which sinks your legs downward even in a wetsuit. In an ideal world every swimmer would be able to swim so straight that they would never have to sight but everyone is eventually moved off course slightly by waves, current and even other swimmers. The key point here is that the less often you need to sight the faster you will swim and the best pathway to swimming straighter is bilateral breathing. --- Page 258 Text --- ADAM: You can experiment with keeping your eyes closed in a safe open water environment or an empty pool without lane ropes to see how straight you can swim. The furthest you can travel without moving off course is the answer to how often you should be sighting, give or take a few strokes – at least in calm conditions! Take caution when attempting this though, as hitting an object in the water when swimming can be potentially injurious! Another way of performing a similar exercise is to have your eyes closed when your head is down but then open your eyes whenever you go to sight forwards. This can help to simulate the sensation of swimming in murky water conditions. 3. Minimal Head Lift When Sighting Every swimmer needs to sight forwards in order to stay straight but developing the movement and timing of their sighting technique is something very few people practise regularly. The most common mistake to make when sighting forwards is to lift your whole face out of the water and try

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
Sighting Every swimmer needs to sight forwards in order to stay straight but developing the movement and timing of their sighting technique is something very few people practise regularly. The most common mistake to make when sighting forwards is to lift your whole face out of the water and try to sight and breathe at the same time. In order to lift your head out sufficiently to breathe, the legs have to sink dramatically adding to your drag profile in the water, even when wearing a wetsuit. A good sighting technique involves lifting just your eyes out of the water and then rolling your head to the side to breathe, this should happen in one smooth fluid movement. If you were about to breathe to your right, you would press down slightly with the right arm as you pull through so as to raise just your eyes above the water line before continuing to roll the head with your body’s natural rotation to the right and take a breath as normal. Do not try and hold your head up high for several strokes until you can see exactly where you are going with a waterpolo style of stroke, that is extremely fatiguing. If you do not see where you are going on your first sighting stroke then do not panic, just try again in a couple of strokes time. You will not always get a clear view every time you sight forwards but by sighting two or three times in a row you will gradually change what is initially a fuzzy picture into a clearer view of where you are going. Once you have that image in your head of where you are heading, lock onto it and focus entirely on cutting as straight a line as possible to that

notice your goggles if they are working well but a goggle malfunction could cost you your race. --- Page 260 Text --- CHAPTER 36 Drafting Effectively Swimming behind or to the side of another swimmer to gain an advantage from being in their wake is called ‘drafting’. As we will see later, studies have shown up to a 38% saving in your energy expenditure from drafting another swimmer – that’s a huge saving and equivalent to what you would gain from being tucked up behind a couple of cyclists in a pack if you ride a bike. The benefits of drafting in open water are so great that it is essential for you to become comfortable drafting other swimmers and fine tune your skills in a variety of different positions and situations. ADAM: If you are new to open water swimming or triathlon then you may be wondering if drafting behind another swimmer is legal. Don’t worry, it most certainly is! Unlike in a cycling time trial or non-drafting triathlon bike leg, drafting behind other competitors is very much seen as part of the sport of open water swimming and something that you should be looking to become accustomed to and maximise to your advantage. --- Page 261 Text --- PAUL: In our squad training sessions over in Perth, I am very keen to know and monitor the performance of our swimmers. The best way of doing this is to use a regular time trial over a distance such as 400 m or 1000 m in the pool. I don’t think anyone looks forward to time trials as there is certainly no hiding from the results but it’s only through measuring your performance that you’ll really know whether or not the hard work you are putting in is paying off.

400 m or 1000 m in the pool. I don’t think anyone looks forward to time trials as there is certainly no hiding from the results but it’s only through measuring your performance that you’ll really know whether or not the hard work you are putting in is paying off. Time trials are also an excellent way to assess your key open water skills like drafting. In October 2010 I decided to run a 1000 m time trial for our squads but with a slight twist. In our 5:30 am Tuesday session we have four lanes of differing abilities: Lane 1 (the ‘fast lane’) has swimmers capable of around 20 minutes for 1000 m. Lane 2 (the ‘faster lane’) is capable of approximately 17-19 minutes for 1000 m. Lane 3 (the ‘even faster lane’) around 15-16 minutes for 1000 m. Lane 4 (the ‘fastest lane’) is capable of sub-15 minutes for 1000 m (most swimming around 13 minutes). Drafting in open water is perfectly legal and when performed correctly is a huge strategic advantage. We performed a 1000 m time trial and the eight swimmers in lane 1 averaged 19 minutes and 12 seconds. This was a very pleasing result and a good sign that their hard work was paying off. Unbeknownst to them though, we would be repeating the same exercise again in just two weeks time but this time drafting one behind the other would be actively encouraged! For this second time trial we invited two of the swimmers from lane 2 to swim at the front of lane 1 with the instruction for them to set the pace at their personal best time from two weeks previous. This equated to 17 minutes and 41 seconds for the 1000 m, a pace which they successfully repeated. The other

swimmers from lane 2 to swim at the front of lane 1 with the instruction for them to set the pace at their personal best time from two weeks previous. This equated to 17 minutes and 41 seconds for the 1000 m, a pace which they successfully repeated. The other swimmers in lane 1 started immediately behind and had the sole goal of trying to stay on the toes of the swimmer in front for the entire 1000 m. Knowing that these lane 2 swimmers were significantly faster, many shuddered at the thought of how hard this task would be but, lo and behold, every single swimmer in lane 1 went on to swim 17 minutes and 41 seconds! An improvement of 91 seconds (or nearly 100 m in distance) from just two weeks previous. Even ‘a healthy sprinkling of Swim Smooth magic’ in the areas of training and technique could not give these swimmers that increase in speed in two weeks – it was down to the benefits of drafting faster swimmers. Despite their excellent performances some of the swimmers said that they didn’t enjoy the experience of swimming so close to others and that it felt claustrophobic. This is a fair observation, especially for those newer to open water swimming. However, in the Swim Smooth offices we receive many emails from swimmers around the world who are frustrated that they are under-performing in open water and want to --- Page 262 Text --- know how to improve. A typical comment we hear is ‘once I get through the start I try to find some clear water and then lengthen out’ but there-in lies the problem: clear water is the last thing you should be seeking in open water if you want to achieve your best performances, you should

typical comment we hear is ‘once I get through the start I try to find some clear water and then lengthen out’ but there-in lies the problem: clear water is the last thing you should be seeking in open water if you want to achieve your best performances, you should be looking to draft all the time and prepare in training to be comfortable doing so. Could this be the source of your own open-water plateau? The potential speed improvements gained by drafting effectively make an interesting comparison to those made by improving your conventional stroke technique or fitness. By drafting effectively you stand to gain between 30 seconds and two minutes per kilometre swum, a very large chunk of time which you cannot stand to ignore. Improvements to your speed from stroke technique gains or swim specific fitness may be less than this amount individually but each should be looked at as an important component of your entire preparation. We’ll show you later in Appendix C how you can combine these elements in your training sessions to give you the maximum performance gains for your swimming. The ability to draft effectively takes skill and a certain tenacity, it doesn’t just happen without practice. If you are planning on competing in triathlon or open water swimming events then you should be practising these skills in a structured manner all year round, just as you would your conventional stroke technique. Very few swimmers and triathletes do this, offering you the potential for a distinct competitive advantage! Technical Aside If you are interested in the research behind drafting here’s an overview of the key studies: ADAM: The technical term ‘metabolic cost’ refers to the energy used by the swimmers. You can equate it to your physical effort: a reduction of 20% metabolic

the swimmer you overtook happily swimming on your toes! If you are really in a group of swimmers that are too slow for you then you will need to break free and swim solo but a better strategy might have been to start slightly quicker to find a better group to swim with. Your innate pace judgement∗ is important here as it will help you judge your own pace and those of others around you at the start of a race, allowing you to look for swimmers slightly faster than yourself to latch onto in the first 50 m or 100 m. Of course if you know your competition well then you can simply line up directly behind a swimmer slightly faster than yourself before the race starts and stick to them like a limpet when the gun goes off! This tactic has personally served me well in many races and seen me significantly outperform where I would otherwise finish in a race. ∗Pace judgement is a very important skill in swimming and one that you can fine tune by using your training sessions in the pool.

Med Sci Sports Exerc. 30:1276–1278. --- Page 267 Text --- CHAPTER 37 Turning Around Buoys PAUL: The annual ‘Swim Thru Perth’ race is a 4 km swim in the Swan River from Barrack Street Jetty to Matilda Bay and is Australia’s longest-running open water swimming event, having been inaugurated in 1919. The musician and artist Rolf Harris famously raced the 4 km in the early 1950s swimming backstroke. At the time Rolf was the Australian junior backstroke champion and a very handy swimmer by all accounts. I have competed in this event most years since I moved to Perth in 2002 and one incident springs to mind when discussing turning around buoys and the general mêlée of swimming in close quarters to other swimmers. The gun had gone off and we were into the first few hundred meters of the swim when I first became aware of a swimmer alongside me who I just couldn’t seem to shake off. We were constantly bumping into each other in a bid to pick the straightest line, neither wishing to concede an inch or wisely choosing to sit back and jump on the other’s toes for a nice draft. The swim course is one long straight-line with a final very sharp right-hand turn with 80 m or so to the finish. By this point we had been duelling it out for just over 48 minutes and clearly whoever made it first around that buoy would beat the other. I felt a hand reach out and grab my shoulder, ducking me several feet under the water. Coming up and gasping for air, another hand perfectly connected with the same shoulder and forced

a turn buoy in a triathlon or open water swim can be very intimidating to those new to open water swimming. Many worry about getting caught up on the fixing rope or being pushed --- Page 268 Text --- under water by their competitors (a very rare occurrence). These fears are mostly groundless but there is little wonder many swimmers give turn buoys a very wide birth adding considerable distance to their swims. You might also feel the need to switch to head-up breaststroke round the buoy in an effort not to get swamped. This will ruin the rhythm and flow of your swim though and can result in other competitors swimming into the back of you. By working on improving your turning technique you can swim through these areas of the course in a much more effective (and impressive!) manner: 1. Get Ahead. If you have been swimming side by side with a couple of other swimmers, it will serve you well to make sure that you are the first around the buoy. Put in a short burst of speed about 25 m before the turn to get there first. 2. Corkscrew Roll. As you approach the buoy, keep in close and aim to slide the hand closest past the buoy and roll over onto your back and then continuing the roll immediately back onto your front. Add in a little twist as you do so and this should give you a neat 90° turn without breaking your stroke rhythm. If you wish to turn left, it’s your left hand that should slide past the buoy to start the process and for a right turn, your right hand should slide past. For very tight turns try combining two consecutive rolls to bring you around the buoy quickly and efficiently.

rhythm. If you wish to turn left, it’s your left hand that should slide past the buoy to start the process and for a right turn, your right hand should slide past. For very tight turns try combining two consecutive rolls to bring you around the buoy quickly and efficiently. This skill does take some time to master but it is a lot of fun and practice makes perfect! 3. Know Your Bearings. Once you are around the buoy focus immediately on locating the next marker buoy, do not dilly-dally here! Quickly seek out the mark and get a clear bearing on it, making use of any landmarks in the background to assist you. Keep the surge going at this point and you might just drop the guys who went into the turn with you. PAUL: Larger marker buoys at the bigger events will float very high on the water such that they create a body width’s gap under the buoy as the design tapers underneath. Avoid getting so close that you find yourself in this gap as it can be very difficult to escape without the room to bring your arm over the surface of the water! --- Page 269 Text --- CHAPTER 38 Better Wetsuit Swimming Most swimmers have a good appreciation of the potential performance gains of swimming in a wetsuit, mostly from the increase in buoyancy offered by the suit. A low-lying body position in the water is the biggest factor holding back many lean male triathletes so it is little wonder they experience the biggest improvements of all swimmers from wearing a buoyant wetsuit. ADAM: We conduct a lot of wetsuit testing with different styles of suits and different types of swimmers in Perth. In a well fitting suit, we often see time savings of

we lowered Kate’s swim time from 61 minutes to 53 minutes. How did we do this? Technically Kate swims very well in the open water without a wetsuit but as soon as she put on her suit she felt like she was going backwards. We took a close look at why this was happening. Working with Kate in the pool in Perth. With our Swim Types system we identify the ‘Kicktastic’ swimmer who typically suffers in a wetsuit from this loss of balance; as the name suggests these swimmers like to use a strong 6-beat leg kick but wetsuits tend to bring them so high at the rear they start to kick into thin air. We identified Kate as a bit of a Kicktastic through listening to the issues that she found she was experiencing during racing. Some Overgliders who have adopted a very low head position report this same unbalanced sensation in a wetsuit. Kate has a super high body position in the water, especially in her wetsuit. She can easily afford to use a forward-looking head position with her stroke. If like Kate you feel unbalanced or too high at the rear in your wetsuit it is doubtful that you are actually slower in it; much more likely is that you gain less from a suit than other swimmers you train with and so end up looking slower relative to them. The only way to be sure is to perform a time trial with and without the --- Page 271 Text --- wetsuit in the pool. Either way, it is a very frustrating situation to be in, especially if you have invested quite a bit of money in your wetsuit. Many Kicktastics and Overgliders have developed their swimming with the idea that they should always keep their eyes

Page 271 Text --- wetsuit in the pool. Either way, it is a very frustrating situation to be in, especially if you have invested quite a bit of money in your wetsuit. Many Kicktastics and Overgliders have developed their swimming with the idea that they should always keep their eyes looking straight down with a very low head position. The belief here is that doing so helps lift the hips and legs higher in the water and so reduces drag. However, for those who already have good natural buoyancy in the water wearing a wetsuit can substantially change their balance. In maintaining the same head position with the wetsuit on, the feet of these swimmers will often pop up out of the water leaving them feeling very unbalanced. Kate also felt like she was not strong enough to use her wetsuit, that her shoulders would fatigue very quickly when using one. She experimented with a short-sleeve suit but whilst her shoulders felt a little looser, she still wasn’t performing as well as she would like in it. Kate benefited from using a straighter arm recovery. To dramatically improve Kate’s swimming performance: 1. We asked her to forget the notion of looking down but aim to look forward in the water by about 1.5 m (5 feet). This brought her legs back down into a usable and more stable position without reintroducing drag. This change also helped her substantially improve her drafting ability by being more aware of other swimmers around her from whom she could gain a tow. 2. We asked her to forget the notion of swimming with a classic high-elbow recovery over the water, which causes premature fatigue in the shoulders when working against the restriction of the wetsuit. A straighter arm recovery increased the range of movement

her from whom she could gain a tow. 2. We asked her to forget the notion of swimming with a classic high-elbow recovery over the water, which causes premature fatigue in the shoulders when working against the restriction of the wetsuit. A straighter arm recovery increased the range of movement and relaxation in her shoulders. 3. We encouraged Kate to swim more regularly in the wetsuit (both in the pool and open water) and objectively test against the stopwatch which changes were having the greatest impact. --- Page 272 Text --- 4. We refined her drafting skills and then ensured that she practised these skills as regularly as possible with faster swimmers. Kate’s story not only shows how important it is to swim with the right stroke technique in your wetsuit but also the wider potential for making improvements in your performance by adopting the right changes to your stroke for the conditions and environment you are racing in. Whether you are already swimming well in a wetsuit or not, there is plenty of opportunity to improve your performances further using the following tips: 1. Get the Right Fit These days many triathletes buy much of their equipment from on-line stores but a wetsuit should always be tried on before purchasing. Ideally visit a retailer who stocks a range of different suits and be fitted out by an expert. Many stores now have Endless Pools to allow you to test suits before purchasing them, an extremely worthwhile exercise. Like running shoes, you are not looking for the best looking or most expensive suit, you are seeking one that both fits you well and is matched to your stroke type.

adapt their breathing patterns were at a severe disadvantage, which saw over 60% of the field withdraw from the race. Just three days before the event I had set a training session for my swimmers of 15 × 100 m with 20 seconds rest between each. The goal was to hold their best maintainable pace for the whole set. This set is nothing new or unique and all the swimmers had performed this sort of set before. What we did do though was instruct all the swimmers that they must only breathe to their left for the first five repetitions, only to their right for the next five repetitions and finally bilaterally (every three strokes to both sides) for the last five repetitions. Looking at the weather forecast it was my belief that the conditions down in Busselton could prove challenging and I didn’t want to risk the old adage of ‘failing to plan is planning to fail’. During the set the swimmers monitored their times per 100 m for each of the three breathing patterns to identify how much faster and more comfortable they were on one side versus the other. What was very interesting was that whilst for some breathing to their weaker side felt unusual, the time differential to their stronger side was much smaller than anticipated. This simply showed the swimmers that if they had to breathe to their non- dominant side because of conditions, they wouldn’t lose much or any time in doing so. This was a great confidence booster to them when they got in the water on race day. I’m very pleased to report that of the 34 squad members who raced from our team, not a single person pulled out of the event and of the 1000+ entrants we claimed three top-10

was a great confidence booster to them when they got in the water on race day. I’m very pleased to report that of the 34 squad members who raced from our team, not a single person pulled out of the event and of the 1000+ entrants we claimed three top-10 finishes overall and eight individual age- group gold medals. A very successful day for Swim Smooth! IMPORTANT! Remember, when practicing in open water always ensure that you are swimming with a buddy and that someone on the shore knows where you are. Also ensure that there is adequate safety support at your swimming venue in the event of a problem. In conditions where there are swells, tides, currents and cold water, if you are in any doubt about your ability to cope, DO NOT attempt to swim. The following tips are designed to provide food for thought and to encourage you to experiment in a range of open water swimming environments with subtle (or sometimes substantial) adjustments to your stroke technique. --- Page 276 Text --- 1. Flowing Rivers Salt water in the sea or ocean is significantly more buoyant than fresh water in lakes and rivers, something you will notice immediately when swimming without a wetsuit in these environments. Most swimmers welcome any increase in buoyancy as it helps improve their body position in the water. When swimming in fresh water you may wish to adapt your stroke for the reduced buoyancy by tilting your head subtly down to lift your backside and legs higher. When swimming in a flowing river and where access will permit, aim to swim close to the bank when you are swimming against the current and in the middle of the river when the flow is pushing you along. The greatest flow is normally

The hardest part about any cold open water swim is just getting started – after preparing properly, turn your brain off and get on with it. A quiet brain’s a good brain in this respect! WARNING: When swimming in water temperatures of less than 15½° C (60° F) with (and especially without) a wetsuit there is increased risk of becoming hypothermic. Significant care and attention should be exercised whenever considering a cold open water swim. The International Triathlon Union rules state that whilst wetsuits are forbidden in temperatures greater than 22° C (72° F), they are mandatory below 16° C (61° F) for all age-group competitors. All triathlon swim legs are now cancelled in temperatures less than 13° C (55° F) irrespective of distance. FINA also regulates the World Cup 10 km open water swimming events to between 16° C (61° F) and 31° C (88° F). Some of the world’s more notable ultra-marathon events (e.g. the 34 km Lac Magog swim in Canada) have seen temperatures down at 11° C or 12° C (52° F to 54° F) in the past but swimming for this duration in these temperatures without a wetsuit takes significant training and adaptation, often including substantial fat gain for insulation. DO NOT underestimate how potentially dangerous swimming in very cold water can be. 3. Sea and Ocean Whilst the wake and waves generated by other swimmers can turn any flat water into a turbulent mess, it is in the sea and ocean that you’re likely to face the most challenging conditions and where you will need to adapt your stroke technique the most. When entering rough water from the shore, it’s essential to go

other swimmers can turn any flat water into a turbulent mess, it is in the sea and ocean that you’re likely to face the most challenging conditions and where you will need to adapt your stroke technique the most. When entering rough water from the shore, it’s essential to go under (not through or over) breaking waves. Ensure that you know what is underneath you and if it is safe to do so, dive under the waves with both arms extended to protect your head. If the water is shallow and the bottom sandy, grab onto some sand to prevent you being pushed back by the wave and once it has past, drive off the bottom towards the surface and start swimming. You may need to repeat this a few times until you are past all the breaking waves. A straighter arm recovery and higher stroke rate will serve you very well as you make your way through the swell and chop. There are no prizes here for a pretty stroke and this is one of the reasons why many of the world’s best open water swimmers and triathletes have seemingly scrappy strokes in the pool but excel in rougher water where momentum and rhythm is key. We call swimmers with this style of stroke ‘Swingers’, as explained in Chapter 22. Dead spots, overgliding and slow stroke rates significantly inhibit open water swimming in challenging conditions. It’s no wonder that many of the world’s top open water swimmers have stroke rates in excess of 85 strokes per minute (SPM) and can hold this rate for hours on end. They might not have the longest strokes in the world but in open water, the rhythm, momentum and a certain degree of punch are perfectly suited to the environment. You might not

rates in excess of 85 strokes per minute (SPM) and can hold this rate for hours on end. They might not have the longest strokes in the world but in open water, the rhythm, momentum and a certain degree of punch are perfectly suited to the environment. You might not be able to match their incredibly fast stroke rates but --- Page 278 Text --- even aiming to lift your own by 5-6 SPM will make a difference. Revisit Chapter 14 for more information on increasing your stroke rate. Always make sure you have adequate water support at your venue to ensure your safety. Also remember that in rougher conditions you will sometimes be forced to breathe to one side over the other based on the direction of the swell – don’t be caught out by an inability to breathe to both sides. At points in the course with the swell behind you, you will be able to lengthen out your stroke and adopt a stronger kick to ride the waves home. Watch elite surf-lifesavers in these conditions to pick up valuable tips. Swimming well in rough conditions requires constant application and a lot of determination. All of this may feel a little intimidating if you are used to developing a nice smooth relaxed stroke in the pool but fear not, you can learn to adapt your stroke to cope with this environment and it is great fun when you have got the hang of it. If you know that everyone else is going to struggle in these conditions but that you can lift your stroke rate and punch through the waves and chop then you are going to really excel in your races. Most of all, learn to love the experience: it’s akin to the challenges of a hilly

this great sport for life. If you have worked on your specific open water skills both in the pool and in open water training, there’s no reason why you cannot start amongst other swimmers of your speed and take the shortest line to the first buoy. Who knows you might just surprise yourself by finding an excellent draft and having a great swim even if you do get a little jostled occasionally. Through proper preparation you’ll know what to expect, how to tackle it and take advantage of the conditions. Above all else, have fun out there!

Each drill is referred to and discussed in the main text of this book. The purpose and focus of each drill is described clearly. Take the time to read the descriptions carefully and refer back to reflect on the tips once you have tried the drill.

you have tried the drill. Whenever you perform a drill you should always be aware of the purpose of doing it and the key focus points of the drill; never swim drills for the sake of them without a clear purpose in mind. Drills are a very powerful way to improve your freestyle swimming. They are so effective because: They break down the movement patterns of swimming to help you rectify bad stroke habits. They can slow things down to give you time to think about an area of your stroke. They can isolate a particular area of the stroke which must be peformed well in order for you to swim the drill successfully. You can use all the drills in your training but focus particularly on those that are specific to your individual stroke style and needs. See Appendix C for example stroke technique sessions and Chapter 17 on Swim Types where we examine individual stroke styles in detail. One important thing to bear in mind: if you initially find a drill challenging this is normally a sign that it is focusing on an area of your stroke technique that needs work. Don’t shy away from drills that you find hard – instead work on performing them well and this will make a positive impact on your freestyle stroke technique. Use of Fins The Swim Smooth drills make extensive use of fins (flippers) as they are extremely valuable when developing your stroke technique. They offer you support and propulsion to help you perform the exercises in a relaxed manner. Fins are not cheating if you know why you are using them and have a specific purpose in mind, e.g. working on your swimming posture. Some pools, particularly in the UK, have banned the use of fins during public swimming

to help you perform the exercises in a relaxed manner. Fins are not cheating if you know why you are using them and have a specific purpose in mind, e.g. working on your swimming posture. Some pools, particularly in the UK, have banned the use of fins during public swimming sessions. This is very unfortunate for swimmers trying to develop a good stroke technique, so much so that it is well worth approaching your pool’s management to ask if a specific lane or specific time slot can be allocated where fins are allowed. --- Page 282 Text --- Using fins during your technique training is so important that it’s well worth the journey to a pool slightly further away from you to use them. As a last resort perform the drills without fins but shorten the duration of them. For instance 6-1-6 could be shortened to 4-1-4 or even 2-1-2 and 50 m of a drill could be shortened to 25 m. Swimming these drills without fins is a major disadvantage, seek out any opportunity you can to find a specific session or pool where you are allowed to use them. A Modern Drill Pack If you’re an experienced swimmer you will notice that one or two ‘classic drills’ are missing from this pack. These are deliberate omissions either because they emphasise parts of the stroke which are now understood to cause injury or be inefficient, or because superior modern drills exist with the same purpose. You might notice the following drills are missing: Catch-Up is one of the oldest drills and involves swimming with a full catch-up of the arms at the front of the stroke. The purpose of the drill was to emphasise a front quadrant style of swimming but at the same time it flattened body rotation

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
following drills are missing: Catch-Up is one of the oldest drills and involves swimming with a full catch-up of the arms at the front of the stroke. The purpose of the drill was to emphasise a front quadrant style of swimming but at the same time it flattened body rotation and ran the risk of the swimmer over-emphasising the catch-up style. We recommend the 6- 1-6 drill as a direct replacement, it emphasises body rotation to a much greater extent and helps the swimmer set up for a great catch and pull-through. Traditional Single Arm was swum with one arm out in front of the swimmer, and the other arm stroking. The idea was to isolate an individual arm pull so that the swimmer could focus on it. The weak point of traditional single arm drills (which were sometimes performed with a kick-board held in the lead arm) is that they teach the swimmer to catch the water whilst they are flat on their front. This is bad practice and tends to reduce a swimmer’s body rotation. 6-1-6 and Unco drills are superior modern drills used for these purposes. Swimming With Fists is a way of reducing the effective area of the hand so that the swimmer is encouraged to use their forearm as a paddle. This is a good concept but modern paddles such as Finis PT Paddles are a superior way of achieving the same effect. Swimming with fists causes the swimmer to tense up while in contrast specialist paddles allow the hand to stay in a natural relaxed position. These paddles also leave the fingertips in the waterflow which helps maintain feel whilst still reducing the effective area. Kicking With A Board is used by junior and Masters squads to develop a swimmer’s kick power. Most adult

specialist paddles allow the hand to stay in a natural relaxed position. These paddles also leave the fingertips in the waterflow which helps maintain feel whilst still reducing the effective area. Kicking With A Board is used by junior and Masters squads to develop a swimmer’s kick power. Most adult swimmers do not have the ankle flexibility to kick well with a board as the lift at the front worsens the working angle of the foot against the water – in many cases reducing propulsion to zero. If you are keen on introducing some kick work into your training then we recommend kicking without a board in a torpedo position unless you have very flexible ankles. In the Swim Smooth squads in Perth we perform very few dedicated kick sets. Instead, the kicking performed using fins during drills helps to stretch off the --- Page 283 Text --- swimmer’s ankles and bring their legs into a better kicking position. This, combined with specific use of the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick And Swim Back drills, is our preferred approach to improving an adult swimmer’s kick. As discussed in Chapter 9, for adult swimmers tackling distance swimming events, we are not normally looking to create much kick propulsion. The objective is to improve their kick technique so that the legs are lifted high and together with minimum effort and produce the propulsion from the arm stroke combined with body rotation instead. Sink Downs Exhaling constantly through your mouth or nose as you swim is an essential skill for efficient freestyle. Exhaling constantly sounds easy but can be a challenge to get the feel of to begin with, especially if you have many years of holding your breath underwater behind you. --- Page 284 Text --- To help develop your exhalation

as you swim is an essential skill for efficient freestyle. Exhaling constantly sounds easy but can be a challenge to get the feel of to begin with, especially if you have many years of holding your breath underwater behind you. --- Page 284 Text --- To help develop your exhalation technique use this sink down exercise at the deep end of your pool. Sink downs are an excellent way to start your swimming session, even before your warm-up. Tread water and take a breath before bringing your arms down by your side and start exhaling into the water. You’re aiming to sink straight down to the bottom without any pauses or delays. Experiment between exhaling from your mouth and nose to see which is most natural to you. Tipping Point When you exhale you may find that you struggle to sink or that you might sink a little and then come back up to the surface. That’s a sign that you’re not exhaling quickly --- Page 285 Text --- enough and that perhaps you are subconciously holding on to your breath. If you initially sink a little but then immediately return to the surface don’t give up, keep exhaling! You will find that you pass through a tipping point and then start to sink down again. As you continue to practise your sink downs aim to get to this point more quickly and sink straight down without the initial delay near the surface. Relaxation The key to getting rid of the air in your lungs is relaxation, if you’re anxious in the water then this will hold you back from exhaling properly. Imagine you’ve had a stressfull day at work and you get home and collapse onto the couch with a big sigh. That is exactly the feeling you’re aiming

the air in your lungs is relaxation, if you’re anxious in the water then this will hold you back from exhaling properly. Imagine you’ve had a stressfull day at work and you get home and collapse onto the couch with a big sigh. That is exactly the feeling you’re aiming for as you swim – the sensation of sighing into the water. Also experiment with making sounds as you exhale. Try a ‘brrrrrr’ sound through your lips like a motorbike or humming through your nose. As overly simple as this sounds, these cues really can help you tune into exhaling into the water in a relaxed way. Caution for Beginners If you are new to freestyle swimming it is well worth getting a friend or coach into the water with you to make you feel more comfortable. A bit of moral support can go a long way here as you become accustomed to having your face under the water. Three in a Row When you are able to sink down smoothly and quickly, move on to performing three sink downs in a row. This makes the timing much more like swimming: Take a breath and sink down ridding your lungs of air, when you are empty of air push off and return to the surface. As soon as you surface take an easy deep breath in and sink down straight away again. --- Page 286 Text --- Repeat this three times through. The key point to this exercise is that you are either inhaling or exhaling, you are never holding your breath. As soon as you have completed the three sink downs, push off from the end of the pool and start swimming using the breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe mantra. breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
you are either inhaling or exhaling, you are never holding your breath. As soon as you have completed the three sink downs, push off from the end of the pool and start swimming using the breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe mantra. breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe As you swim repeat the phrase breathe - bubble - bubble - breathe to yourself. Literally say ‘bubble’ into the water to remind you to exhale; on a breathing stroke say breathe to yourself as you rotate and take a breath in. This mantra helps you to coordinate bilateral breathing and exhalation together. We’re confident that you’ll find it useful to combine these two important areas of good freestyle stroke technique. Ballet Leg Kick Ballet Leg Kick focuses on improving your kicking technique so as to reduce drag and improve your body position in the water. You’ll need a deep end to your pool where you can’t touch the bottom. --- OCR from Page 286 Image 1 --- "hy =< --- Page 287 Text --- Support yourself on the side of the wall, with one hand lightly holding the pool edge for support. Rest the inside leg and kick back and forth with the outside leg. Place your outside hand on your hip. As you kick back and forth point the toes and turn them slightly inwards; drive the kicking movement from the hips. The knee should be soft and relaxed but not driving the kick, it should flex only slightly with the kicking action. Perform the following sequence: Increase the width of the kick to move further backwards and forwards. Squeeze your backside to drive the movement. Gradually shorten the kick, scissoring back and forth by about 60 cm and then kick as hard as you can for five

slightly with the kicking action. Perform the following sequence: Increase the width of the kick to move further backwards and forwards. Squeeze your backside to drive the movement. Gradually shorten the kick, scissoring back and forth by about 60 cm and then kick as hard as you can for five seconds. Really go for it but maintain the good kicking action! Swap sides and repeat with the other leg. The high-effort kicking action helps your nervous system learn an improved kicking technique. Immediately after the drill swim 100 m of easy paced freestyle, simply thinking about pointing your toes and brushing the big toes lightly as they pass. As you swim, how does your body position feel? Are your legs higher? Do you slip through the water more easily? --- Page 288 Text --- Move on to the Torpedo Kick and Swim Back exercise to further reinforce your kicking technique. If you are a ‘leg sinker’ with a low body position both of these exercises should be very beneficial to you. Torpedo Kick and Swim Back To develop and refine your kicking technique use this exercise, which is based on kicking in a torpedo position. This streamlined position is the same one you should be using every time you push off from the wall, it’s the lowest drag position that you can achieve whilst swimming. Place one hand on top of the other and tuck the top thumb around the side of the lower hand. Then reach as high and tall as you can to produce the tuck. If you are flexible enough you should be able to tuck your arms behind your head. Kick Development Sequence From the end of the lane push off in your torpedo tuck and kick as hard as you can until you run out

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
Move on to swimming 200 m easy freestyle thinking solely about your chosen focus. You can return to your chosen visualisation any time you swim if you feel as though your stroke is becoming ragged. Kick on Side Kicking on your side seems like a simple idea but don’t let that fool you, this is a very powerful drill. This exercise and its progressions, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6, are at the core of the Swim Smooth drill pack. Traditionally swim coaches used side-kicking exercises to help swimmer’s become accustomed with swimming on their side to develop their body rotation. This is a worthy goal but Swim Smooth use these drills to develop two other critical parts of the freestyle stroke: The swimmer’s posture and alignment in the water. An excellent catch set up position. Use these drills to improve these two aspects of your swimming and you can dramatically increase your speed and efficiency in the water. --- Page 291 Text --- Side Kicking Use fins and push off from the end of the pool, bringing yourself perfectly onto your side at 90°. Kick at a steady pace and take your lower arm out in front of you and rest your top arm lightly by your side. Face downward and exhale into the water whilst you are kicking. When you need to take a breath simply turn your head to breathe before returning it to the water: --- Page 292 Text --- Without any further thought, try this exercise and see how you perform. Do you track straight or weave about in the lane? Perform a single arm stroke to swap sides after 25 m, are you better or worse on the other side?

how you perform. Do you track straight or weave about in the lane? Perform a single arm stroke to swap sides after 25 m, are you better or worse on the other side? Now try the exercise again and become aware of the position of your lead hand. Is it pointing arrow straight down the pool or across the centre line? If it’s crossing over it’s very likely that you do the same thing when extending forwards in your full freestyle stroke. Refer to Chapter 10 on posture and remove the crossover by improving your swimming posture, drawing your shoulder blades together and back. You will track a lot straighter and you should also find it easier to stay perfectly on your side as you perform the drill having much better support from the lead hand. Your objective is to transfer this improved posture into your full stroke. The 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills will help you do that. --- Page 293 Text --- Hand Position As you perform the drill, also check your elbow, wrist and fingertip positioning. Is your elbow higher than your wrist and your wrist higher than your fingertips? Is the palm of your hand facing downward? All of these elements should be in place when performing side kicking. If your hand is angled to the side (like a karate chop) or your elbow and wrist are dropped then it’s very likely that these stroke flaws are present in your full stroke too. Bring the palm of the lead hand to face the bottom of the pool and tip the wrist very slightly so the fingers are lower than the wrist. Don’t do this too much or you will feel your hand being pulled down towards the bottom of the pool. If you have a tendency to

the lead hand to face the bottom of the pool and tip the wrist very slightly so the fingers are lower than the wrist. Don’t do this too much or you will feel your hand being pulled down towards the bottom of the pool. If you have a tendency to bring your fingertips towards the surface of the water think about going a little deeper with the whole arm. This will leave you in a much better catch set up position. With your hand angled correctly now check the position of your elbow, is it dropped down low in the water? Bringing it higher than the wrist will give you a lot more support. The shape you make between your elbow, wrist and fingers is slightly curved, like the shape of an aeroplane wing. --- OCR from Page 293 Image 1 --- # “'s --- Page 294 Text --- 6-1-6 6-1-6 is a progession of the Kick On Side drill. Develop your alignment, posture and hand set up position before moving on to 6-1-6 and then 6-3-6. 6-1-6 involves kicking on the side in the same manner as side kicking for around six kicks.

Continue on this side for six more kicks before swapping sides again. As you perform the arm stroke recover the back hand over the top of the water first and keep the lead hand in position. Let your hands nearly catch-up in front of your head before starting the underwater stroke to rotate onto your other side. In your full stroke you would not fully catch-up in front of your head in this manner but this is good technique for 6-1-6. If you are a Bambino or an Arnie Swim Type you may find that you have a strong tendency for the lead hand to collapse down before the recovering arm reaches it. That’s fine and perfectly normal. If you struggle to keep it in front, try using something as a relay baton, in Perth we use Berrocca vitamin tubes. Keep this tube held between the thumb and first finger of your lead hand and when the top hand comes over, transfer it into your other hand. This will help you coordinate the catch up action. The timing of the breathing is important in 6-1-6: take the breath immediately after the stroke, not before! So the drill is really 6-1-breathe-6. This makes the breathing timing as close as possible to full stroke freestyle. 6-1-6 challenges you to maintain your hand positions and posture during the arm stroke. It’s common to see swimmers crossover or drop their elbow as the new hand enters the water and then immediately correct themselves. Instead of doing this, aim to enter straight into the correct position by maintaining

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
6-1-6 challenges you to maintain your hand positions and posture during the arm stroke. It’s common to see swimmers crossover or drop their elbow as the new hand enters the water and then immediately correct themselves. Instead of doing this, aim to enter straight into the correct position by maintaining your posture during the stroke. A good indication that you are doing this right is in how straight you are able to track down the pool. Over-Rotation With side-kicking drills you may feel unstable on your side as if you are going to topple onto your back. If your lead hand is not crossing over in front of your head then the cause is likely to be that you are slightly over-rotated beyond 90°. To improve this, bring your resting hand towards the front of the thigh as if it is in a jeans pocket. That should help you regain your balance. It’s worth highlighting that whilst these drills bring you to 90° of rotation, in your normal stroke we are looking for 45–60°. The drills emphasise the rotataion with the --- Page 296 Text --- view that you will transfer some of it into your full stroke. 6-3-6 As a further progression to 6-1-6, kick on the side for six kicks before performing three strokes, each nearly catching up in front of your head. Perform each stroke with perfect alignment and a great catch set-up position - fingertips below wrist and wrist below elbow. If you can, breathe immediately after the three strokes: 6-3-breathe-6. If that’s too little breathing, add in a breath during the arm strokes as well. Middle Finger Visualisation A useful visualisation whilst side kicking, and during the arm strokes in 6-1-6 and 6-3- 6, is to think solely about the middle finger on your lead

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
after the three strokes: 6-3-breathe-6. If that’s too little breathing, add in a breath during the arm strokes as well. Middle Finger Visualisation A useful visualisation whilst side kicking, and during the arm strokes in 6-1-6 and 6-3- 6, is to think solely about the middle finger on your lead hand and where it is pointing. Keep it pointing straight down the lane at all times. Use this visualisation during full- stroke freestyle too, to help you maintain your alignment as you swim and avoid crossovers. Progressing to Full-Stroke Freestyle The sequence of side kicking, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 progressively builds up the freestyle stroke whilst focusing on your posture and alignment in the water and your catch set-up position with the elbow higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips. The next step is to perform some full-stroke freestyle. We recommend that you perform this immediately after performing the drills, whilst you still have your fins on. For instance: 3x 100 m as : 25 m kick on left side + 25 m kick on right side + 50 m freestyle 4x 100 m as : 2x : 50 m 6-1-6 + 50 m freestyle 2x : 50 m 6-3-6 + 50 m freestyle As you enter into full-stroke freestyle following the drill think about maintaining your alignment and extending your hand in front of the same shoulder. For examples of how we recommend integrating these drills into full training sessions see Appendix C. Broken Arrow The Broken Arrow drill is designed for swimmers with tight shoulders and upper backs to help them loosen off.

Broken Arrow drill is designed for swimmers with tight shoulders and upper backs to help them loosen off. It’s a derivative of the 6-1-6 drill and should always be performed wearing fins. --- Page 297 Text --- As in 6-1-6, kick on the side but without delay take the top hand and raise it up vertically over your head and pause it there for two seconds. This is your ‘arrow’. After pausing for a second, break the arrow by bending at the elbow and then spear into the water in front of the head. Rotate on to the other side and breathe before returning your head to the water and lifting your arm on that side. The mantra of the drill is: up - break - spear in - breathe - up - break - speak in - breathe. Whilst your arm is vertical, think about sinking your arm down into the shoulder socket for two seconds before breaking the arrow. This helps you to improve your swimming posture by engaging your scapular. When you have a feel for the rhythm of Broken Arrow, maintain a focus on your lead hand, keeping it straight and aligned by drawing your shoulders back and together. --- Page 298 Text --- Using Broken Arrow You can swim Broken Arrow at any time but as with Shoulder Tap, it’s a perfect drill to add to your warm-up to help you loosen off your shoulders. A good warm-up is: 200 m easy freestyle 300 m with fins as 3x: {50 m Broken Arrow + 50 m freestyle} 100 m easy freestyle with pull buoy --- Page 299 Text --- Popov The Popov drill is used to develop your body rotation and a classic high elbow arm recovery.

with fins as 3x: {50 m Broken Arrow + 50 m freestyle} 100 m easy freestyle with pull buoy --- Page 299 Text --- Popov The Popov drill is used to develop your body rotation and a classic high elbow arm recovery. The drill is named after legendary Russian sprinter Alexander Popov who won the 50m and 100 m freestyle at both the Barcelona and Atlanta Olympics. Alex used the Popov drill successfully in his own swimming preparation. To perform Popov, wear fins and push off from the end of the pool. Move into a side lying position with the bottom hand in front as in all side kicking exercises. Slide the thumb of the top arm up to the armpit. Then return it to the hip before sliding it to the armpit again, at which point bring the hand over and spear into the water to change sides. The movements of the drill are relaxed and quite slow, don’t force or hurry them. The “up - down - up - and through” should be continuous and without pause. If you are very tight in the shoulders you may not be able to reach your armpit with your thumb. In which case perform the drill with the elbow opened out slightly, coming within a few inches of the armpit. Popov helps you to develop a good sense of balance and core control in the water. The drill also emphasises a classic high elbow recovery over the top of the water. High elbow recoveries are seen by many swimmers as an elegant and gracefull way to swim. Whilst this is certainly true, be aware that such a recovery may not suit your individual style. See Chapter 17 on Swim Types. If you intend to swim in open water you will also

High elbow recoveries are seen by many swimmers as an elegant and gracefull way to swim. Whilst this is certainly true, be aware that such a recovery may not suit your individual style. See Chapter 17 on Swim Types. If you intend to swim in open water you will also need to open out the elbow angle so as to gain sufficient hand clearance over disturbed water. Shoulder Tap Shoulder Tap is an excellent drill to work on if you want to achieve a positive spearing hand entry into the water. If you tend to splash down with a flat hand or drop the elbow in first as you enter into the water, Shoulder Tap is for you. You can also use it to help undo a thumb-first entry with the palm facing outwards. --- Page 300 Text --- Use fins and perform a catch-up style of stroke where the hands nearly meet at the front. As the top arm recovers over the water, tap the shoulder lightly and then spear in fingertips first. Make sure the palm of the hand is facing downward as you do so. To help drive good rotation in the drill, breathe on every single stroke to both sides! The mantra of the drills is: breathe - tap - spear in . . . breathe - tap - spear in . . . After performing the drill keep the fins on and transition to full-stroke swimming focusing on good body rotation and a spearing hand entry into the water from a high angle : e.g. 4 × 100 m as: 50 m Shoulder Tap + 50 m freestyle When transitioning to freestyle, imagine a small fish is swimming just in front of you in the water. As you recover the arm and enter into the

entry into the water from a high angle : e.g. 4 × 100 m as: 50 m Shoulder Tap + 50 m freestyle When transitioning to freestyle, imagine a small fish is swimming just in front of you in the water. As you recover the arm and enter into the water you’re aiming to spear the --- Page 301 Text --- fish just in front of your head. This visualisation will help you to develop the positive spearing entry you need in your stroke. Shoulder Tap can help loosen off your shoulders too, which makes it an excellent drill to include in your warm-up. Doggy Paddle Doggy Paddle is perhaps the oldest drill in the book but it’s a great one none the less! This version is swum with more rotation than kid’s doggy paddle and is known as ‘long-dog’ in some parts of the swimming world. Doggy Paddle is a powerful drill for developing your catch and ‘feel for the water’ as it forces you to develop an early bent elbow catch. Performing the drill with a straight --- Page 302 Text --- arm catch, which many swimmers use in their full stroke, is nearly impossible! If you struggle to perform the drill it’s likely that you are in the habit of catching the water with a straight arm, in which case this drill will be very useful for you indeed. Performing Doggy Paddle As with sculling drills, always use a pull buoy with Doggy Paddle to avoid any assistance from the legs. Push off from the wall and start performing strokes, returning the recovering arm forwards underwater. This underwater recovery might feel odd at first. Don’t worry too much about your return path, simply slip the hand forwards fingertips first as easily as you can. Emphasise ‘reaching over

assistance from the legs. Push off from the wall and start performing strokes, returning the recovering arm forwards underwater. This underwater recovery might feel odd at first. Don’t worry too much about your return path, simply slip the hand forwards fingertips first as easily as you can. Emphasise ‘reaching over the barrel’, bending your elbow right at the front of the stroke and exaggerating the movement as much as possible. Keep the lead hand constantly in motion, either extending forwards, tipping over and catching the water or pulling it backwards. Don’t pause at any stage! The drill’s mantra is ‘reach and roll!’. Repeat this to yourself to help develop the rolling action. Pull through to your hip on every stroke, emphasising your body roll as you do so. Drill Tips You can perform the drill either with your head up above the water or down beneath watching your arm strokes. There’s a tendency to tense up when performing Doggy Paddle, try and relax and breathe! Visualise an imaginary rope about 50 cm or 1½ ft underneath you. As you pull- through you are aiming to pull down this rope. If you tend to pull very wide in your stroke or pull-through with a straight arm the rope-visualisation will be very powerful. Think of this as if you are normally pulling down two seperate ropes, one for your left arm and one for your right. Merge these ropes together into one single line. Once you have a good feel for the drill, experiment with adding a touch more rhythm and tempo to the movements. If you’re too gentle with it you will struggle --- Page 303 Text --- to feel the water properly so lift the tempo a touch to develop the rhythm and timing of a good catch. When Doggy

drill, experiment with adding a touch more rhythm and tempo to the movements. If you’re too gentle with it you will struggle --- Page 303 Text --- to feel the water properly so lift the tempo a touch to develop the rhythm and timing of a good catch. When Doggy Paddle is performed well you can move quite quickly! Technique Sets As with sculling, transition from Doggy Paddle straight into some full-stroke freestyle so as to transfer the catch movement into your swimming: 15 m Doggy Paddle into 35 m rhythmical freestyle Doggy Paddle can be combined with Scull #1 very nicely – the two drills complement each other very well: 10 m Scull #1 + 15 m Doggy Paddle + 25 m swim Doggy Paddle is a mainstay of the Swim Smooth drill pack, all swimmers should perform it regularly in their training sessions in order to develop their catch technique and stroke timing. Scull #1 Sculling is an extremely valuable drill to help you develop your ‘feel for the water’ – how it feels to position and time the catch and pull movements of the stroke correctly. The most important of the sculling positions and the one you should practise the most is Scull #1. This replicates the point in the stroke out in front of the head where you first latch onto and catch the water. Most swimmers press downward, to the side or even --- Page 304 Text --- forwards in this position. Scull #1 teaches you to begin pressing the water backwards at this critical point of the stroke. If you struggle to perform this drill at first don’t be put off, this simply highlights that the catch is a weak point in your stroke and that you will benefit greatly from developing your ‘feel

you to begin pressing the water backwards at this critical point of the stroke. If you struggle to perform this drill at first don’t be put off, this simply highlights that the catch is a weak point in your stroke and that you will benefit greatly from developing your ‘feel for the water’ in this position. Performing the Drill Always use a pull buoy between your legs when sculling so as not to gain any assistance from your leg kick. Push off and bring your head out of the water, and begin sculling left and right in front of the head. Come slightly wider than your shoulders and bring your hands together so that they nearly touch in front of your head: Change the angle of your hand slightly so that you are leading the scull with the palm of your hand. You’re looking to keep a constant pressure on the palm of the hand from the water. At all times keep your fingertips lower than your wrist and your wrist lower than your elbow – you may be surprised at how low you have to go with your fingers to achieve this position. If you stay too shallow with your hands your forward progress will be slow or non-existent: Just like in full-stroke freestyle, by showing the palm of your hand slightly backwards you will be propelled forwards. Sculling drills move you through the water at a slow pace but get the drill right and you will feel your chest lift up in the water and your pace increase. --- Page 305 Text --- When you are getting a good feel for the drill deliberately accentuate this position by drawing your shoulder blades back and lifting your chest high. This introduces good swimming posture into the drill. Sculling is

chest lift up in the water and your pace increase. --- Page 305 Text --- When you are getting a good feel for the drill deliberately accentuate this position by drawing your shoulder blades back and lifting your chest high. This introduces good swimming posture into the drill. Sculling is best performed over short distances of 10–20 m before being immediately transitioned into full-stroke freestyle. For instance, complete the following four times through with 15 seconds recovery in between: 100 m as 15 m Scull #1 into 85 m freestyle As you transition into freestyle, think about lightly pressing the water back to the wall behind you. Use the Smiley Face On The Palm Of Your Hand visualisation described in Chapter 13 to help reinforce this. Don’t be surprised if your stroke rate picks up slightly when swimming after sculling, that’s a good sign that you’ve improved your catch technique – go with it! Scull #1 can be used in combination with other drills, for instance: --- Page 306 Text --- 10 m Scull #1 + 10 m Scull #2 + 30 m swim 10 m Scull #1 + 15 m Doggy Paddle + 25 m swim Scull #1 is a mainstay of the Swim Smooth drill pack, perform it regularly in your training sessions to develop and maintain your ‘feel for the water’. Scull #2 Scull #2 is similar to Scull #1 but it focuses on an area of the stroke directly under the head as the swimmer transitions from the catch to the pull phase. This drill is very useful if you have a tendency to pull wide with your arm stroke or pull through with a straight arm. As with Scull #1, always use a pull buoy and push off with your head above the surface, looking

Drill Unco is a special drill which helps you to develop the rhythm and timing of your stroke. We love Unco at Swim Smooth as it brings so many elements of your stroke together and forces you to time your catch, pull and body rotation correctly. You can even use it to polish up the timing of your breathing. Australians love to shorten any word and put an ‘o’ on the end - in this case shortening ‘uncoordinated’ to make Unco. This probably tells you straight away that it is quite a challenging drill! We’d encourage any swimmer to give it a try but it is probably best suited and most beneficial for upper-intermediate and advanced level swimmers. If you are a bit of an Overglider or have any dead spots or pauses in your stroke then you’ll find Unco challenging but very useful. Unless you have an exceptionally propulsive kick, always use fins when performing Unco. It’s a one-arm drill, performed with one arm by your side whilst the other arm performs a full stroke. Try 4 × 100 m with each 100 m swum as: 25 m left arm Unco + 25 m freestyle breathing right + 25 m right arm Unco + 25 m freestyle breathing left How Should It Feel? Since you are only using one arm with a gap between strokes, Unco is always going to have a surge to it: the surge should be forwards with the propulsion coming from the stroking arm. If you feel like you are bobbing up and down a lot then this highlights that you are pressing down on the water at the front of the stroke. This only lifts you up, which doesn’t generate any propulsion and acts to sink your legs, creating drag. If you feel like

you feel like you are bobbing up and down a lot then this highlights that you are pressing down on the water at the front of the stroke. This only lifts you up, which doesn’t generate any propulsion and acts to sink your legs, creating drag. If you feel like you are bobbing vertically then you need to work on a better catch action, pressing the water backwards, not downward. The King of Drills --- Page 309 Text --- At Swim Smooth we call Unco “The King Of Drills”. This is because it is beneficial to almost any swimmer, even elite swimmers. Unco also helps you to put all the elements of your stroke together, making sure that everything works with the right timing – no other drill does this nearly as well. You will feel the magic of Unco when you swim normal freestyle immediately after performing the drill. We recommend you perform a short swim every time following Unco, keeping the fins on and just feeling the easy rhythm and timing of the arm stroke. The improved smoothness and efficiency can be a revelation! Paddle-Unco: “P-Unco” Performing Unco with a small pair of paddles can be useful as it increases the working area of the hand, which improves your awareness during the catch phase at the front of the stroke. Use a small pair of paddles for this purpose, keeping a small amount of pressure under your fingertips as you use them. We recommend the Finis Freestyler paddles. Only perform P-Unco in small doses as the paddles increase the load on your shoulders. Most of the time we recommend normal Unco in your drill sets but the addition of P-Unco can make for an interesting and stimulating change. --- Page 310 Text --- Breathe away from the stroking

Only perform P-Unco in small doses as the paddles increase the load on your shoulders. Most of the time we recommend normal Unco in your drill sets but the addition of P-Unco can make for an interesting and stimulating change. --- Page 310 Text --- Breathe away from the stroking arm and breathe on every single stroke – even if you don’t feel that you need to – this helps to drive your body rotation. We suggest that you start with your right arm stroking and breathe to your left as shown in the pictures. Once you get the feel of the drill swap sides every 25 m or so. The key to this drill is to make sure that you rotate your body fully to the dead side as shown in the last picture. There’ll be a temptation not to do this, the key is ensuring that you dip your non-stroking arm and shoulder down into the water as shown in the last picture. --- OCR from Page 310 Image 1 --- dip this ‘dead’ shoulder down into the water --- Page 311 Text --- The mantra of the drill is ‘stroke and dip . . . stroke and dip . . .’. You will really have to emphasise dipping the ‘dead’ shoulder into the water as there’s no arm stroke on that side to help you. The body rotation within the drill is critical. Get it right and your stroking arm will recover easily over the top of the water. However, stay flat on that dead side and the arm recovery will be very tough! If you struggle to coordinate the drill don’t worry, that’s normal – in fact that’s the whole idea and it simply highlights that the timing of your stroke may need some work. When

the water. However, stay flat on that dead side and the arm recovery will be very tough! If you struggle to coordinate the drill don’t worry, that’s normal – in fact that’s the whole idea and it simply highlights that the timing of your stroke may need some work. When you get it right Unco should feel smooth and rhythmical. Waterpolo Drill Head-up Waterpolo drill is useful for advanced level swimmers as it improves the rhythm and timing of their stroke. The drill is particularly effective for removing dead spots as it’s nearly impossible to swim head-up with a pause in the stroke! Keep your chin on the surface and swim with positive stroke movements and a strong rhythm. Keep the head still and looking forwards, try and relax as much as possible and don’t forget to breathe! The key to this drill is to swim it at near sprint pace over short distances. It’s physically demanding so unless you’re very adept at the drill, stick to 25 m at a time as a maximum. Too many swimmers perform Waterpolo style drills at the slowest pace they can but for developing stroke rhythm, faster is better as long as good control can be maintained. --- Page 312 Text --- If 100% is a full sprint then a 90% effort is about right for the drill. If you struggle with Waterpolo try it wearing a pair of fins to give you a little assistance, or even a pull buoy. After performing the drill, transition into a set of short fast efforts swum with a fast stroke rate. For example: 2 × 25 m Waterpolo drill at 90% effort 2 × 25 freestyle at 90% effort – emphasise rhythm 2 × 25 m Waterpolo drill at 90% effort 2 × 25 freestyle

the drill, transition into a set of short fast efforts swum with a fast stroke rate. For example: 2 × 25 m Waterpolo drill at 90% effort 2 × 25 freestyle at 90% effort – emphasise rhythm 2 × 25 m Waterpolo drill at 90% effort 2 × 25 freestyle at 90% effort – fast rhythmical stroke Swimming with Bands Swimmming with bands is another drill which focuses on delivering better rhythm and timing to your stroke. Wearing a band around your ankles stops you kicking and also adds a little drag to the back of your stroke, which will want to pull your legs downward. For most swimmers we recommend using a pull buoy between your legs at the same time but if you have good natural buoyancy you can perform the drill without one. Swim normal freestyle with your upper body and swim with a high stroke rate, getting into your catch quickly. Stretch tall through your core, lifting your rib cage away from your hips as much as possible. Swim short distances at a time such as 25 m or 50 m. This drill never feels easy as everyone’s legs sink to a greater or lesser extent. The key is to keep your legs as high as possible during the drill by using a good stroke rhythm and a stretched core. When you transition back to normal swimming you’ll have a heightened awareness of your body position and stroke rate. --- OCR from Page 312 Image 2 --- hey --- Page 313 Text --- You can experiment with your stroke whilst wearing a band to see the effect it has on your body position. Try: Pushing down on the water during the catch with a straight arm. Pushing the water forwards as if overgliding and putting on

or a priority for you right now. The Arnie: plenty of power, needs more control! --- Page 315 Text --- PAUL: As an Arnie you may feel impatient to become a strong swimmer but ironically that may be one of the things holding you back. You need to slow things down a touch and work on areas of your stroke technique at a slower pace. I often tell swimmers such as yourself to recognise that impatience and to ‘Tame The Arnie!’. You won’t have a problem speeding things back up in the long run but taking the time and patiently working on your stroke technique is so important for your progress. 1. Develop your exhalation technique using the Sink Down and Breathe - Bubble - Bubble - Breathe exercises, you are looking to exhale as if sighing into the water – it is not as easy as it sounds to let that air go! Try to relax and develop a real sense of calmness as you perform these exercises and with your swimming in general. You may be surprised at how relaxed you can become whilst swimming. 2. Improve your breathing technique by keeping your head lower as you swim using the bow wave, Popeye Breathing and Split Screen visualisations. Refer to Chapter 7 for more information. 3. Tune up your kicking technique using the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick and Swim Back exercises. These may seem overly simple but they can make a huge difference to your body position and so your drag profile in the water. As you swim after these drills become aware of how high your legs are in the water, you are looking to feel your ankles gently breaking the surface but do not do that by bending at the knees!

position and so your drag profile in the water. As you swim after these drills become aware of how high your legs are in the water, you are looking to feel your ankles gently breaking the surface but do not do that by bending at the knees! You’ll know when you get this right as you will slip much more easily through the water. 4. Work on your swimming posture using the YTWL exercise (Chapter 29) and Kick On Side, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills. Not only will these drills help you remove crossovers from your stroke they will also improve your body rotation. Becoming straighter and more aligned in the water is critical for your progress as an Arnie and should be a constant focus for you as you continue to develop as a swimmer. Crossovers have a habit of coming back without constant maintenance! 5. Focus on your initial catch and pull using the Doggy Paddle and Scull #1 drills. The key goal here is to focus on pressing the water backwards from in front of the head after hand entry and extension rather than pushing it downward. This will give you greater propulsion and act to keep your legs higher in the water. Remove the crossover from your stroke by drawing your shoulders back and chest forwards whilst performing the side-kicking drills. --- Page 316 Text --- 6. Experiment with a straighter arm recovery to help overcome any restriction in your shoulders or upper back. A classic high elbow recovery requires good flexibility and range of motion in these two areas and does not suit some swimmers with limited range of movement. See Chapter 11. 7. Try lowering your stroke rate slightly, ideally using a stroke-rate beeper such as a Wetronome or Tempo Trainer Pro. Lowering your natural

main ways of kicking in swimming, a 6-beat kick or a slower 2-beat kick. You may have heard about the efficiency benefits of using a 2-beat kick but for most Arnies with low-lying legs a light 6-beat kick will suit you much better as it will help to keep your legs higher in the water. Whilst a 2-beat kick uses less kicking effort this will be more than offset by a low-lying body position from the lack of lift created. Bambino Stroke Correction Process If you are a Bambino, use the process below to develop your swimming. Work on one thing at a time, for instance you might start with working through steps 1–3 for a few sessions before moving on to more advanced steps. Sometimes it takes things a while to ‘stick’ but that’s OK, keep practicing and they will come together nicely in your stroke. ADAM: Always keep a positive approach to your swimming and enjoy every small improvement made along the way – not only will this keep you motivated but a positive approach will directly result in a more confident and positive stroke style, which will be a great thing for your swimming. I love coaching Bambinos as they’re swimming for all the right reasons – because they enjoy it and would love to be good at it! A personal plea from me: keep setting yourself small challenges, think of yourself as a proper swimmer and don’t be afraid to push yourself. You may be surprised at what you can achieve in the water; most Bambinos are much better swimmers than they allow themselves to believe!

at what you can achieve in the water; most Bambinos are much better swimmers than they allow themselves to believe! The Bambino: more confidence and a better ‘feel for the water’ is required! --- Page 318 Text --- 1. Develop your exhalation technique by using the Sink Down and Breathe - Bubble - Bubble - Breathe exercises listed in Appendix A. This is critical for your stroke because a build-up of CO in your system will make swimming feel much 2 more tense than it needs to be. Exhale smoothly into the water with a relaxed sigh – If you have ever done any yoga you will understand how powerful this can be for your relaxation. As you start swimming use the breathe-bubble-bubble-breathe mantra to help coordinate bilateral breathing and exhalation together. Do not worry if the breath itself still feels a struggle, we will come to that later. 2. Tune up your kicking technique using the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick and Swim Back exercises. A relaxed flutter kick that comes from the hip (not the knee) will burn less oxygen and bring your legs up higher in the water, creating less drag. You’re not looking to kick hard in your swimming so make sure that your kick is just light enough to bring your legs up so that your ankles break the surface. 3. Tune in to good stroke timing using the Kick On Side and then 6-1-6 drills. These may feel quite strange and hard to coordinate at first but that’s OK. A weak point in a Bambino’s stroke is that their lead arm slips down in the water when breathing, when in fact it should be out in front of the head offering support. As you perform the 6-1-6 drill you may find that the

coordinate at first but that’s OK. A weak point in a Bambino’s stroke is that their lead arm slips down in the water when breathing, when in fact it should be out in front of the head offering support. As you perform the 6-1-6 drill you may find that the lead arm wants to collapse down as the top arm comes over during the arm stroke. If this happens practise using a Vitamin tube as a relay baton, as described in Appendix A. Move on to 6-3-6, all the time catching up for the moment with your arms in front of your head. You should immediately notice more support when breathing. Developing a good exhalation technique is critical to helping you relax in the water. 4. Reinforce your stroke timing by repeating the 1-2-stretch mantra to yourself as you swim. The 1 and 2 being on normal strokes and the stretch on a breathing stroke, this will help to remind you to keep that lead hand out in front of you for support whilst breathing. You should be able to let your breath take care of itself whilst you think about keeping that lead hand stable. --- Page 319 Text --- 5. Work on your head position whilst breathing using the Popeye Breathing and Split Screen visualisation described in Chapter 7. You are aiming to keep your head low in the water and breathe into the bow-wave trough. If you have tried this before it will be much more achievable now that we have improved your stroke timing in steps 3 and 4. 6. Develop a basic ‘feel for the water’ using the Scull #1 drill.

now that we have improved your stroke timing in steps 3 and 4. 6. Develop a basic ‘feel for the water’ using the Scull #1 drill. You may well find sculling quite a challenging exercise at first but that’s OK, this is highlighting a bit of a hole in your proprioception (body awareness) at this point in front of your head. Do not be put off by this; you have much to gain by developing this area of your stroke. Make sure that your fingertips are pointing at a downward angle into the water and that your elbows are higher than your wrist – you may have to go a little deeper with your hands than you might expect in order to achieve this. 7. Further improve your catch mechanics using the Doggy Paddle drill. Perform this drill quite strongly using positive arm movements, focusing on bending your elbow out in front of your head, really exaggerating the movement of ‘reaching over the barrel’. Transition into full freestyle and feel yourself being pushed through the water on every arm stroke. 8. Increase your stroke tempo by performing some short fast efforts, for instance 4 × 50 m swimming. If you own a stroke beeper such as a Wetronome or Finis Tempo Trainer Pro, set this to 5–10 strokes per minute higher than your normal stroke rate and simply time your strokes to the beep. Even though this is faster than normal it will not necessarily feel harder because the increased sense of rhythm will benefit your stroke. Kicktastic Stroke Correction Process If you are a Kicktastic, use the following process to develop your swimming. The main feature is in step 4 where we develop your catch and ‘feel for the water’.

sense of rhythm will benefit your stroke. Kicktastic Stroke Correction Process If you are a Kicktastic, use the following process to develop your swimming. The main feature is in step 4 where we develop your catch and ‘feel for the water’. As you make the shift to upper-body propulsion you should find that the reliance on your leg kick naturally starts to drop away. 1. Tune up your exhalation technique using the Sink Down and Breathe - Bubble - Bubble - Breathe exercises in Appendix A. Despite being quite experienced swimmers, many Kicktastics hold their breath under the water, which makes swimming much harder than it needs to be. Developing your ability to breathe out smoothly into the water will make swimming feel easier and give you more time when you do go to take a breath as you will only have to inhale, not exhale and inhale in the same short window! Many Kicktastics returning to swimming after years off from the sport feel that they never regain their swimming fitness. However, this can simply be due to poor exhalation technique and essentially turning what should be a very aerobic activity into something much more anaerobic by never releasing the build-up of CO in their system. 2 --- Page 320 Text --- The Kicktastic: a better catch and ‘feel for the water’ will allow them to moderate their kick. 2. Give your kicking technique a once over using the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick and Swim Back exercises. Despite having powerful leg kicks, many Kicktastics kick hard from the knee rather than kicking with a relatively straight leg from the hip. Developing an improved kicking technique will reduce the oxygen demand from the kick, making breathing much easier. 3. Work on improving posture and rotation using the Kick

Despite having powerful leg kicks, many Kicktastics kick hard from the knee rather than kicking with a relatively straight leg from the hip. Developing an improved kicking technique will reduce the oxygen demand from the kick, making breathing much easier. 3. Work on improving posture and rotation using the Kick On Side and then 6-1- 6 and 6-3-6 drills. Poor body rotation is a feature of the Kicktastic’s stroke and is often accompanied by a crossover in front of the head. Many other Swim Types would experience a scissor kick as a result of the crossover but Kicktastics normally do not as the strong 6-beat kick smothers this tendency. However, the crossover is still very damaging for a swimmer’s catch, which requires good alignment into the water. These drills will also improve a Kicktastic’s swimming posture, which is often quite poor and results in them swimming quite flat in the water (see Chapter 11). As you perform the side-kicking exercises work on opening up your chest and drawing your shoulder blades together and back. This will help drive body rotation and set up for a propulsive arm stroke. 4. Develop your catch mechanics using the Scull #1 and Doggy Paddle drills. As a Kicktastic you can expect these drills to feel quite alien and challenging at first, which simply highlights the catch as a weak point in your stroke. Perform the drills using a pull buoy and resist the temptation to add a little kick to the drill – that is very much cheating! Perform Scull #1 first, focusing on developing a good catch position with the elbows higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips.

As you perform the drill imagine that there’s a rope under your body around 50 cm (1½ ft) beneath you – if you pull through with a straight arm then you will be deeper than the rope so you need to bend your elbow in order to keep your hand on the line of the rope. You can also visualise swimming in a very shallow pool or perhaps over a sharp coral reef in about 50 cm of water! Doggy Paddle is a great drill for Kicktastics as it really emphasises their body rotation on every stroke. Exaggerate your body roll during the drill and repeat this mantra to yourself: ‘reach and roll!’ The Classic Kicktastic: over-kicking from the knee and pressing down with a straight arm in front of the head. Once you have the hang of sculling and Doggy Paddle, try this special progression meant only for Kicktastics. It’s a powerful way of helping you shift to upper-body propulsion: Use a pull buoy and perform Scull #1 for around 10 m∗, really tuning into the feeling of the water on the palms of your hands. Transition straight into Doggy Paddle for 10 m∗, emphasising your body rotation and pulling through with a nice bent elbow. Now start swimming freestyle, using the Smiley Face On The Palm Of Your Hand visualisation from Chapter 13, pressing the smiley face back to the wall behind you as you swim. After about 15 m∗ of swimming, part your

stroke flaws in place and if you compare yourself to other swimmers in public swim sessions you’ll be swimming significantly better than most there. Don’t let this go to your head though: the fact is that very few good freestyle swimmers are seen in public sessions. You can really take your swimming to the next level if you buy into proper freestyle technique through developing your catch and improving your rhythm and timing using the process below. 1. Brush up on your exhalation technique into the water using the Sink Down and Breathe - Bubble - Bubble - Breathe exercises listed in Appendix A. Developing your exhalation into the water will help you feel much more relaxed when you swim and is one of the keys to allowing you to breathe bilaterally. 2. Give your kicking technique a quick once-over using the Ballet Leg Kick and Torpedo Kick and Swim Back exercises. Overgliders normally pride themselves on their efficiency in the water and generally understand the importance of kicking from the hip rather than the knee. However, if you use a 2-beat kick you are quite likely to be bending significantly at the knee to provide you with the impetus to restart your stroke. You should be able to brush up your kicking technique quite easily using the exercises, which, as a consequence, will also help raise your body position higher in the water. 3. Work on improving posture and catch set-up using the Kick On Side and then 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills. If you are crossing over in your stroke it is essential that you remove this by drawing your shoulders down and back as you swim. Not only will this help you to swim straighter but it will also set you up for a good catch to follow.

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
and 6-3-6 drills. If you are crossing over in your stroke it is essential that you remove this by drawing your shoulders down and back as you swim. Not only will this help you to swim straighter but it will also set you up for a good catch to follow. Also, work on improving your hand and wrist position whilst kicking on your side, keeping the palm facing downward, the elbow higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips. Whilst this will not remove the dead spot from your stroke by itself, it is an essential first step in the process as it improves your catch set-up. You may also find that you need to go a little deeper in the water with your lead hand than you expected in order to get into a good catch set-up position. After making these changes to your stroke you may already notice your stroke rate start to lift up naturally – that is a very good sign that you are making real progress. 4. Develop your catch mechanics using the Scull #1 and Doggy Paddle drills. As an Overglider you might find these drills quite challenging at first as they highlight the weak point in your stroke technique. With Scull #1 focus on ‘reaching over the barrel’ and getting into that good high elbow position with the fingertips lower than the wrist and the wrist lower than the elbow. Feel the water on the palm of your hand in this position. Whilst performing Doggy Paddle emphasise bending the elbow early in front of your head and keep your lead hand constantly in motion – either extending forwards, catching the water or pressing it backwards but never pausing! Keeping the arms and hands constantly in motion might feel very alien

this position. Whilst performing Doggy Paddle emphasise bending the elbow early in front of your head and keep your lead hand constantly in motion – either extending forwards, catching the water or pressing it backwards but never pausing! Keeping the arms and hands constantly in motion might feel very alien to you at first but this is a critical element to move across into your full stroke. --- Page 324 Text --- Move from dropping the wrist and showing the palm forwards (left) towards tipping the fingertips down and keeping the elbow higher than the wrist (right). PAUL: An interesting experiment to try as an Overglider is the Scull #1 drill but purposefully done incorrectly with the elbows and wrists dropped and the palm of the hand facing forwards. This position is designed to replicate the position that your hand and forearm might be in when trying to overglide. As you attempt to do Scull #1 incorrectly you’ll notice that you either stay stationary or you start to actually move backwards in the water! You’ll also probably notice your legs sinking at this point, even if using a pull buoy to keep your legs buoyant. Pay attention to how much water pressure you feel on the palm of your hand as you scull incorrectly in this position – it’s likely to be a lot more than when you do it correctly and are moving forwards. This is one of the key reasons why it’s easy to be fooled into the idea that your overglide is preceded by a good catch as you feel significant water pressure on the palm of your hand; the only trouble with this is that the water pressure is actually slowing you down significantly and effectively pushing you backwards! Now transition into doing the drill correctly

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
idea that your overglide is preceded by a good catch as you feel significant water pressure on the palm of your hand; the only trouble with this is that the water pressure is actually slowing you down significantly and effectively pushing you backwards! Now transition into doing the drill correctly and regaining forward momentum, taking this same sensation into your freestyle stroke along with your renewed focus on pressing the water behind you, not down and certainly not away from you. 5. Improve your stroke timing using the Unco drill. Unco helps time your arm stroke around your body rotation and makes it nearly impossible to keep a dead spot in your stroke. This will be another challenging drill for you but one that’s well worth revisiting and reinforcing as you go forward with your swimming. Waterpolo drill and Swimming With A Band make excellent additions to your swim programme as you will feel your improved stroke timing coming together. 6. Experiment with different head positions to see which works best for you. Many Overgliders have been told to look straight down when they swim but with better exhalation, an improved catch technique and better rhythm and timing you may no longer need to do this to keep your legs high in the water. Swim 4 × 25 m and on each 25 m try a different head position: Bury your head low in the water with your chin coming in towards your chest. Look straight down at the bottom of the pool. Look slightly ahead, about 1 m in front of you to the bottom of the pool. Raise your head further and look about 3–5 m in front of you. Which feels best and most comfortable? If you can successfully use a higher head position it will give

of the pool. Look slightly ahead, about 1 m in front of you to the bottom of the pool. Raise your head further and look about 3–5 m in front of you. Which feels best and most comfortable? If you can successfully use a higher head position it will give you a much greater proprioception (body awareness) of what’s happening out in front of your head, helping you to refine and --- Page 325 Text --- maintain your catch technique. This is one reason why elite swimmers prefer this head position. 7. Use a stroke rate beeper such as a Wetronome or Finis Tempo Trainer Pro to help reinforce the improved rhythm in your stroke. With an improved catch technique you will be pressing the water backwards rather than pressing it downward, this takes less time and helps to lift your stroke rate naturally. Often you will not even be aware that your stroke rate has lifted. Set your stroke rate beeper back to what your natural stroke rate was before you started this stroke development process. How does it feel? Uncomfortably slow? Lift your stroke rate upwards with the beeper until you feel your new stroke click back into its rhythm – notice how this does not feel any harder and yet you are moving much quicker and more easily through the water. This is an indication that your swimming is becoming really efficient! As you continue forwards from here a stroke rate beeper will be an extremely good investment in your swimming, especially if you train outside of a squad. Use it to control and monitor your stroke rate as you continue to refine your catch technique and stroke timing. 8. Experiment with a light 6-beat flutter kick if you do not use one already. Although a 2-beat

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
investment in your swimming, especially if you train outside of a squad. Use it to control and monitor your stroke rate as you continue to refine your catch technique and stroke timing. 8. Experiment with a light 6-beat flutter kick if you do not use one already. Although a 2-beat kick uses less energy it naturally suits a shorter faster stroke style, not a long smooth one. Depending on your natural buoyancy you may find that your body position is higher in the water with a light 6-beat flutter kick. This will create less drag and lower your energy expenditure overall despite the extra kicking. Swinger Stroke Correction Process If you are a Swinger follow the process outlined below and refer to the relevant sections of this book to develop your swimming. 1. Brush up on your exhalation technique into the water using the Sink Down and Breathe - Bubble - Bubble - Breathe exercises listed in Appendix A. Despite being experienced swimmers, Swingers are some of the worst culprits when it comes to holding their breath underwater. It’s possible that their fast stroke rate lets them get away with this more than other types since their breathing comes around quicker. However, by improving your breathing technique you’ll feel much more relaxed in the water and might be able to move to breathing every five strokes rather than three. Breathing less often is always an advantage as all swimmers lose stroke efficiency when breathing. The Swinger: experienced swimmer with excellent stroke rhythm who needs a tune-up. --- Page 326 Text --- 2. Work on improving posture and alignment in the water using the Kick On Side and then 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills. After many years of swimming, Swingers often slip into a few bad habits and start to cross over

stroke rhythm who needs a tune-up. --- Page 326 Text --- 2. Work on improving posture and alignment in the water using the Kick On Side and then 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills. After many years of swimming, Swingers often slip into a few bad habits and start to cross over in their strokes both in front of the head and below the body. We’ll use the Doggy Paddle and Scull #2 drills later to reinforce pulling down the centre line of the body under the water and not crossing over. The overall effect of these drills may be a slight drop in your stroke rate but a slight lengthening of your stroke, which will offset this. We are not trying to kill your rhythm here, but just to strike the right balance between the length of your stroke and the rate of your stroke. 3. Pay attention to your hand entry with the objective of removing a thumb-first entry technique from your stroke. As described in Chapter 12, a thumb-first entry is the most common cause of shoulder pain and injury and should be avoided at all costs. To help remove a thumb-first entry use the Shoulder Tap drill and the two visualisations from Chapter 12: Hide The Palm and Briefcase Carry. Choose the visualisation that feels best for you and return to it when swimming in your normal training to help break the habit. A thumb-first entry can be a difficult habit to break so be persistent here! 4. Tune up your catch and pull mechanics by using the Scull #1, Scull #2 and Doggy Paddle drills. Working on your catch and ‘feel for the water’ is a critical area for improvement for you as a Swinger. You may find it best to slow down your stroke a touch

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
Tune up your catch and pull mechanics by using the Scull #1, Scull #2 and Doggy Paddle drills. Working on your catch and ‘feel for the water’ is a critical area for improvement for you as a Swinger. You may find it best to slow down your stroke a touch to take a little more time over your catch, if you have a Wetronome or Finis Tempo Trainer Pro try lowering your stroke rate by 3–5 strokes per minute. This will help you to develop your ‘feel for the water’ and give you the time to engage with it properly, increasing your propulsion. Doggy Paddle and Scull #2 drills are great for removing any crossovers under the body where the hand crosses the centre line. These are common to see with --- Page 327 Text --- Swingers and will cause you to lose propulsion and weave from side to side slightly as you swim. Visualise a rope under your body and pull down this rope as you swim – focus on not crossing over the centre line! Work on fixing that tendency to cross the centre line under your body – it will lose you propulsion, put stress on your shoulder and cause you to weave slightly down the lane. 5. Reconnect with your rhythm and timing using the Unco drill. After improving your posture and catch mechanics using the above process you will have refined your pull-through technique and will be getting a greater purchase on the water. However, these changes may well have subtly altered the timing of your stroke, which may feel strange at first. To help synchronise these changes to your body rotation use the Unco drill, focusing on the mantra Stroke And Dip as you do so. Feel how your body rotation drives the stroke,

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
these changes may well have subtly altered the timing of your stroke, which may feel strange at first. To help synchronise these changes to your body rotation use the Unco drill, focusing on the mantra Stroke And Dip as you do so. Feel how your body rotation drives the stroke, and, when you start swimming, feel that easy rhythm to your stroke. As discussed above, you may end up at a slightly lower stroke rate than you are used to. That is fine if it means better alignment and propulsion in your stroke as you will be swimming quicker overall. 6. Optional: formalise your 2-beat kick using the process below. This is an advanced skill and is only suitable for Swingers whose strokes are becoming quite refined. A 2-beat kick only really suits swimmers with fast stroke rates – those with a slower stroke rate are normally much more suited to a light 6-beat flutter kick. Kick on your front with fins on and both arms down by your side. Use a deep vertical scissoring of the legs to kick – we are looking for large movements switching between the two positions: left leg up + right leg down and right leg up + left leg down. As you kick down with one leg, dip the opposite shoulder into the water. --- Page 328 Text --- As you kick notice how the opposite shoulder naturally dips into the water. Continue this for at least 50 m, becoming used to the sensation, making it feel quite snappy through the hips and core. Keep the fins on and move to a lap of freestyle only breathing to the left. As your right hand enters into the water, roll and breathe to the left and simultaneously try the big deep kick down with

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
sensation, making it feel quite snappy through the hips and core. Keep the fins on and move to a lap of freestyle only breathing to the left. As your right hand enters into the water, roll and breathe to the left and simultaneously try the big deep kick down with the left leg. Make this a very positive movement each time the right hand enters into the water. Repeat the exercise but this time breathing to the right and kicking down with the right leg as the left hand enters into the water. You are unlikely to be able to think about both sides simultaneously as you swim so just focus on one side and simply mirror the other side of your stroke. Progress to swimming using bilateral breathing, timing the leg kick against your hand entry as described. A 2-beat kick looks easy but is an advanced-level skill. Always practise using fins at first and using big exaggerated movements. Once you feel accustomed to the timing of the kick try integrating it into your normal swimming without using fins and with a much more compact and tidy kicking amplitude. Smooth Stroke Correction Process In contrast to the other Swim Type processes, which work on specific weaknesses, these steps are really an all-round once-over on your stroke. As a Smooth there won’t be too much amiss but you will notice the benefits from tuning up a few areas of your stroke that have slipped a little. 1. Give your exhalation technique a tune-up using the Sink Down exercise in Appendix A. Despite your experience as a swimmer, the chances are that your exhalation is not what it could be. This won’t be hard for you to improve but you will need to constantly remind yourself to exhale smoothly and efficiently

technique a tune-up using the Sink Down exercise in Appendix A. Despite your experience as a swimmer, the chances are that your exhalation is not what it could be. This won’t be hard for you to improve but you will need to constantly remind yourself to exhale smoothly and efficiently into the water whilst you develop the habit. The Smooth: the envy of the pool but may need to adapt their stroke for high- performance in open water. --- Page 329 Text --- 2. Give your posture and alignment in the water a once-over using the Kick On Side and then 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drills. As a Smooth this should be a strong area of yours but it is worth becoming aware of the importance of good posture in swimming. As we all get older we lose our natural flexibility so a little on-going maintenance in this area is well advised. If you have only been breathing to one side (see Chapter 7 and steps 4 and 5 below) then this is going to be important to you as you might have become a little lopsided in your stroke from doing so. Pay particular attention to your catch set-up position here using a slightly cocked wrist set-up with the fingertips lower than the wrist. This will help you initiate the catch effectively and help you to develop your ‘feel for the water’. 3. Revisit your catch mechanics using the Scull #1 and Doggy Paddle drills. You are probably familiar with these or similar exercises from your youth but might not have tried them in a while or focused on the right areas when doing so. We are looking to reignite your ‘feel for the water’, which will have already been assisted by an improved catch set-up from step 2. If

these or similar exercises from your youth but might not have tried them in a while or focused on the right areas when doing so. We are looking to reignite your ‘feel for the water’, which will have already been assisted by an improved catch set-up from step 2. If you feel like your catch is not what it once was then pay attention to bending your elbow early in front of your head – both drills will assist you in doing so. 4. Introduce bilateral breathing if you are not already breathing to both sides regularly. With a good exhalation technique into the water and no hint of overgliding in your stroke you will find breathing every three strokes straightforward for the majority of your training. Bilateral breathing helps you to balance out your stroke and gives you practice at breathing to both sides – an important tactical consideration for racing well in the open water. 5. Check your breathing timing by visualising turning your head away from your arm as it enters the water and extends forwards on a breathing stroke. Turn your head smoothly away so that you never get a glimpse of it entering the water and --- Page 330 Text --- you will find that you have more time to inhale, which will make things feel much more relaxed. Late breathing is shown on the top sequence: the body rotates between (1) and (2) and then the head lifts to breathe (3). Correct timing is shown on the bottom row. The head rotates to breathe in time with the extension of the arm forwards. 6. Rhythm and timing is an important component of any great freestyle stroke and after steps 1–5 it is time to revisit it in your stroke. Use the Unco drill to

shown on the bottom row. The head rotates to breathe in time with the extension of the arm forwards. 6. Rhythm and timing is an important component of any great freestyle stroke and after steps 1–5 it is time to revisit it in your stroke. Use the Unco drill to help time your arm stroke with your body rotation. You will find that a smooth catch is essential during the drill as well as an emphasis on dipping the ‘dead’ shoulder down on every stroke. The magic of Unco is experienced when you start swimming immediately following the drill – you should feel super-smooth (even for you) and perhaps get some flashbacks to your best days in the water. If you feel that you have a tendency to add a slight overglide into your stroke then the Waterpolo and Pull Buoy and Bands drills are well worth adding to your training routine as they will move you towards a more continuous flowing extension and catch. 7. Pay attention to your stroke completion at the hip. The Unco drill in step 5 has focused a little on this area already but some additional focus might be useful if you have a tendency to over-emphasise the back of your stroke. A distinct push at the rear is not advisable as it creates a dead spot in its own right and can create a flicking movement into the air. This flick makes for an awkward arm recovery and --- Page 331 Text --- can cause pain in the elbow known as ‘Golfer’s Elbow’, or more correctly as Medial Epicondylitis. For more information see Chapter 13. The rear of the stroke should be completed without locking the elbow straight as shown here. It should also finish with a slight inwards turn of the hand

can cause pain in the elbow known as ‘Golfer’s Elbow’, or more correctly as Medial Epicondylitis. For more information see Chapter 13. The rear of the stroke should be completed without locking the elbow straight as shown here. It should also finish with a slight inwards turn of the hand towards the top of the thigh to complete the stroke and make for a nice hand exit. Try this the next time you swim and notice how powerful but smooth it feels. Turn the hand in slightly towards the top of the thigh to complete the stroke and exit cleanly. 8. Fine tune your stroke rate using a stroke rate beeper such as a Wetronome. This is a great way to reinforce the good work you have performed on your alignment, catch and timing. You may well find that you can increase your stroke rate slightly after this work, which will help the rhythm of your stroke. If your objective is to perform well in open water races then this is critical. You are not looking to lift your stroke rate by deliberately shortening the stroke – you still start at full extension and finish each stroke at the same point on the hip. Instead you get into your catch a little bit quicker at the front, emphasising stroke length less and focusing on rhythm instead. --- Page 332 Text --- 9. Add some new fitness training elements to mundane interval sessions using our advice on training in Key 2 of this book. If you have a strong sprint background, this type of threshold-based training at CSS pace (Critical Swim Speed) when combined with a lap interval beeper like the Wetronome or Finis Tempo Trainer Pro can really add an exciting and motivating element to your sessions, especially if you

of this book. If you have a strong sprint background, this type of threshold-based training at CSS pace (Critical Swim Speed) when combined with a lap interval beeper like the Wetronome or Finis Tempo Trainer Pro can really add an exciting and motivating element to your sessions, especially if you find it hard to find anyone to swim with who can push you along at your pace. Set yourself some challenging targets for a set of 200 m intervals for example (e.g. 2:24 / 200 m) and dial in the Wetronome to beep every 18 seconds. Simply aim to be at each 25 m marker each time the beep goes and without realising it you will be half way through a really rewarding hard-fitness set trying to make sure that the little beeper does not get ahead of you! This adds in an element of pace awareness and is very much a technique set in itself – can you survive the entire set holding good form without blowing up? The format for these types of sessions is only limited by your imagination and we have included some of our favourites for you in Appendix C. ∗These distances are our best recommendations for completing this exercise in a 50 m pool – if you are swimming in a 25 m or 25 yd pool, try halving the suggested distances or ensure that your turn is quick and does not disrupt your focus on your catch. --- Page 333 Text --- APPENDIX C Training Sessions About These Training Sessions To create a training session, pick from the training sets in this guide.

C Training Sessions About These Training Sessions To create a training session, pick from the training sets in this guide. We’ve provided six of each type to choose from: Warm-up. Build sets. Technique focused main sets. Fresh and fruity (CSS). Long endurance sets (suitable for Ironman and long distance open water swimmers). Sprint sets. Open water skills sets. Cool-downs. Each type of set is available as one of six themes: 1. Something Classically Simple (aimed loosely at Arnies). 2. Something Relaxing (aimed loosely at Bambinos). 3. Something A Little Different (aimed loosely at Kicktastics). 4. Something More Technical (aimed loosely at Overgliders). 5. Something Rhythmical (aimed loosely at Swingers). 6. Something Smooth (aimed loosely at Smooths). Pick a set that suits your Swim Type or your mood and ‘mix and match’ with other sets to create a whole session. The endurance sets stand alone as sessions by themselves but for everything else construct your session as a sequence of: Warm-up set. Build set. Main set chosen from: technique, fresh and fruity (CSS), sprint or open water skills. Cool-down set. In total there are over 5,000 combinations to experience!

the Author 220 v --- Page 7 Text --- This page intentionally left blank --- Page 8 Text --- Foreword The world of swimming has been very good to me. Growing up in Winter Haven, Florida, I was able to go from the kid who got cut from other sports to Olympic champion. As a television commentator for swimming, I get to continue my pas- sion for the sport that I love. I have known Coach Scott Bay for many years, and we’ve had many great talks about swimming: its history, its evolution, and, most important, the recent advances in technique. We have worked together at several clinics, and we always have a great exchange of ideas and observations. Coach Bay is truly a student of the sport. In Swimming: Steps to Success, Coach Bay explains the elements of technique that are part of good swimming. There will always be variations by elite swimmers, and I encourage you to explore some of your own. This book can serve as a jumping-off point where you can get sound advice on stroke technique and instruction. So . . . whether you picked up this book out of curiosity or sought it out because you want to see what swimming has to offer, you will enjoy Coach Bay’s detailed instruction and continue your journey into the amazing world of fun, fitness, and competition in swimming. Best wishes to you on your journey!

Page 9 Text --- This page intentionally left blank --- Page 10 Text --- Climbing the Steps to Swimming Success Swimming has been practiced as both a sport and a recreational activity for thou- sands of years. People at the highest levels of competition swim with such grace and ease that it seems almost effortless. For a beginner or novice, on the other hand, swimming may seem like an exhausting chore that can be done well only by people who possess a natural talent for it. The truth, however, is that anyone can learn to swim—and swim well. With this goal in mind, Swimming: Steps to Success shows you how to feel more comfortable in an aquatic environment and takes you through a progression of skills for each of the competitive strokes. Step 1 starts with the basics—floating and finding your natural buoyancy. Step 2 addresses ways of manipulating the water for propulsion. Steps 3 through 6 cover the fundamentals of the four competitive strokes—freestyle, backstroke, breast- stroke, and butterfly. Steps 7 and 8 focus on turns and starts, and step 9 addresses open-water and survival swimming. Step 10, the final step, gives you some guidance for continuing your swimming journey. The Steps to Success approach to swimming is systematic in building on a solid foundation of skills and techniques. Each step should be approached in the following manner: 1. Carefully read all material in the step. 2. Study the technique photos and, if necessary, use a mirror or a friendly observer to duplicate them yourself. 3. Study the common errors that coaches look for so that you can avoid them! 4. When reading about and executing the drills, keep in mind that they are often designed as “overcorrections” for a specific technique flaw. Drills are intended to help you

friendly observer to duplicate them yourself. 3. Study the common errors that coaches look for so that you can avoid them! 4. When reading about and executing the drills, keep in mind that they are often designed as “overcorrections” for a specific technique flaw. Drills are intended to help you create a new pattern of movement. After completing each drill, remember to score your success. 5. At the end of each step, review the key points in the Success Summary to make sure that you understand the material. Then total your scores from the drills in that step and make sure that you’ve achieved the needed level of success before moving on to the next step. As you make your way through the steps, you will begin to appreciate that swim- ming is not so much about brute strength as it is about the timing and rhythm of your movements. Getting it right takes a lot of thoughtful practice, and you will benefit from revisiting the steps when you have trouble with a particular skill or technique. ix --- Page 11 Text --- Climbing the Steps to Swimming Success Swimming is a journey, and this book is designed to help you work through that journey one step at a time. Each step is laid out with a focus on a certain skills or techniques and ways to increase or decrease the difficulty. If you have trouble with a particular skill or step, remember that swimming consists of complex sets of move- ments that are not part of any other athletic activity.

move- ments that are not part of any other athletic activity. Be patient with yourself; the key is your progress. As with any journey, no matter how long or short, this one begins with the first step. x --- Page 12 Text --- The Sport of Swimming This book is a guide to help you better understand the fundamentals of swim- ming, which can be defined simply as the act of propelling oneself through the water. Because an instructional book cannot reasonably address all of the rules and regulations applied to swimming, this introduction provides an overview of the sport and introduces certain swimming terms commonly used by coaches and swim- mers. Throughout the rest of the book, each term is further defined in the context in which it is typically used. The sport of swimming has been around for thousands of years, dating back at least to 36 BCE, when Japanese people held organized swimming contests. From then right up until today, it has been a very simple matter to determine the winner of a swimming contest: whoever finishes first! Over the years, races have covered a variety of distances, ranging from about 25 yards (23 m) to lengths that could be measured in miles or kilometers. Races can be further separated into disciplines, or strokes; they can also involve medleys, in which various strokes are used, and team relay races. In modern swim- ming, the strokes include freestyle (also known as the front crawl), backstroke, breast- stroke, and butterfly. Modern rules dictate the specifics of format, but the essential structure of each race is the same: a start, a swim, and a finish.

butterfly. Modern rules dictate the specifics of format, but the essential structure of each race is the same: a start, a swim, and a finish. The AquATiC environmenT Swimming differs from other sports in several ways. For one thing, swimming is not necessarily a natural activity for human beings. Indeed, humans bear little resem- blance to species that are geared to operate in an aquatic environment; for example, fish don’t have necks. As a result, in order to swim, we humans must make some adaptations—in part to accommodate our differences but also to take advantage of them. For success in swimming, you must first become comfortable in the aquatic envi- ronment, which differs dramatically from the land-based environment in which we typically operate on a daily basis. It is easier to do so if you understand the key dif- ferences between humans and aquatic creatures. First, as mostly terrestrial creatures, we walk upright, and our natural position for most of our waking hours is basically vertical. In the water, however, most of what we do involves being horizontal, and this difference takes some getting used to for most people. In addition, in many sports, success depends largely on strength and speed. In swimming, however, there is nothing solid to push against; therefore, though strength does matter in swimming, it is much more important to apply pressure to the water in the correct way. Because water is a fluid, it moves around you rather xi --- Page 13 Text --- The Sport of Swimming than resolutely resisting you in the way that a solid does. Similarly, speed in swim- ming comes not necessarily from moving your body parts faster but from using your movements to put pressure on the water in an effective manner. As anyone who has participated in water

often referred to as an Olympic-size pool. LCM pools are 50 meters (~55 yd) long, and though they may not look particularly long on Olympic television broadcasts, the experience of swimming in them can be much different than that of swimming in a short-course pool. All of these competition pools share certain standard features, such as starting blocks and—even more important, as discussed in step 4 of this book—a set of back- stroke flags. These flags, or pennants, are strung across the pool’s lanes 5 yards or xii --- Page 14 Text --- The Sport of Swimming False start Backstoke rope flags 5 m 15 m 5 m 25 m E6544/BAY/FIG 01.01/534229/KH/R1 meters from the edge of the pool to signal to backstroke swimmers that they are approaching a wall—a crucial safety feature. Competition pools are also outfitted with starting blocks, or platforms. In addition, during competitions, a thin sensor is attached to the pool wall to record the time of each swimmer’s first touch rather than relying on handheld timers. Pool rACeS The majority of swimming meets and races take place in pools (rather than in open-water environments), and venues around the world host events featuring var- ious strokes and distances on courses like those just described. Each national swim- ming federation has its own minor rule variations, but the basic structure of a swim race is always the same. All competitors start at the same time and adhere to the rules of the prescribed stroke, and the finish order is ranked from fastest to slowest. In events with more participants than lanes, the competition is conducted in mul- tiple rounds or “heats.” Either heats are used to seed swimmers for the final, or heats are pregrouped to put swimmers of similar speed in the same heat, and the

order is ranked from fastest to slowest. In events with more participants than lanes, the competition is conducted in mul- tiple rounds or “heats.” Either heats are used to seed swimmers for the final, or heats are pregrouped to put swimmers of similar speed in the same heat, and the best time from any heat wins the race. These can be used to determine seeding for finals or so that similar-speed swimmers all swim together, and the heats are timed with the fastest swimmer being declared the winner. It has become easier to compare times from different heats thanks to the development of sophisticated timing equipment, standardized and certified pool lengths, and touch pads that automatically stop a clock when a swimmer makes contact. xiii smroftalp gnitratS m 31.2 m 92.81 Figure 1 A 25-meter pool. --- Page 15 Text --- The Sport of Swimming geTTing STArTed: APPArel In order to learn the sport of swimming and train effectively for competition, you need certain kinds of gear. For starters, choosing the right suit can be an important part of both your appreciation of swimming and your comfort in the water. Many types of modern swimsuit are available in different fabrics and cuts. Something that you might wear to the beach is not necessarily the best choice for a swimming workout, since beachwear is designed more for fashion than for function. Swimsuits, on the other hand, have evolved to maximize fit and functionality. Swimsuits Unlike ancient swimmers, modern contestants are of course required to wear some sort of swimsuit. Suit design has changed dramatically over the years, and today males typically opt for a brief or “jammer,” which runs from waist to just above the knee. These formfitting suits are typically made of a material that stretches, such as nylon, spandex,

course required to wear some sort of swimsuit. Suit design has changed dramatically over the years, and today males typically opt for a brief or “jammer,” which runs from waist to just above the knee. These formfitting suits are typically made of a material that stretches, such as nylon, spandex, polyester, or a combination thereof. Females typically wear a one-piece suit that covers the body from the mid-thighs to the shoulders; suits vary in style and cut. For training purposes, swimmers may opt to use any of a variety of suits that are less expensive or less restrictive or provide some extra element for training purposes, such as the increased drag of looser suits. Goggles Goggles have been around for a long time but came into widespread use only in the 1970s; they are now considered an integral part of sport swimming. For several reasons, goggles come in many styles. How does one know which style to buy? Some styles are geared toward a particular activity, such as scuba diving, snorkeling, or triathlon, and others are available in different sizes, shapes, and tints. Quality should be assessed on the basis not of price but of fit. The best goggles are the ones that fit you—that is, the ones that fit your face comfortably and keep the water out. Remember, their purpose is to enhance your vision and reduce eye irritation from pool chemicals or, in open-water environments, other sources. To test the fit, place the eyepieces on your eye sockets, below the bony part where the eyebrows are located, in the softer part of each socket. Without using the strap, press the goggles gently onto this soft tissue and see if they stay even for just a few seconds; if they do, you have a good fit! The strap merely

buoys, and snorkels. Kickboards The kickboard (figure 2) is a fairly common piece of equipment found in many swim- mers’ training bags. It is typically made of some sort of foam to provide flotation. Its purpose is to provide a buoyancy assist so that swimmers can isolate and train the kicking motion. It is often used to train all four competitive strokes. Figure 2 Two different styles of kickboards. xv --- Page 17 Text --- The Sport of Swimming Fins Fins are commonly used in swim training to add resistance to the kicking motion, helping the person to swim more easily or to make the workout harder. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes (figure 3), and some are designed specifically for a cer- tain competitive stroke—for example, the monofin and the breaststroke fin. Monof- ins are a training tool specific to dolphin kick. Breastroke fins are also very specific to that kick and, due to the increase in pressure on the groin area and the inside of the knee, should probably be used only under the supervision of a knowledgeable coach and with a swimmer who has had sufficient technique training and the strength to benefit from the extra resistance. For training purposes, fins with medium-size blades work for most swimmers, though it is a good idea to use shorter blades in the beginning in order to prevent injury. People who have less strength or flexibility in the lower extremities—especially the ankles—should definitely use a medium or shorter blade of 6 to 9 inches (about 15 to 23 centimeters) to prevent overstressing those joints with the added pressure and resistance created by longer blades (often seen in scuba shops). In addition, short-blade fins (shorter than 6 inches, or 15 cen- timeters) are often used to work with

ever, not to become dependent on that equipment for being able to move through the water with skill and ease. In addition, your success depends on doing the drills and using the equipment correctly rather than quickly. As with any learning, some swim- mers progress faster than others, and each skill presents new a challenge. Therefore, prepare yourself to be patient—swimming is a learned process that takes some time. Swimming is one of the best sports in which to participate from a very young age to a very old age. Some competitions even offer a 95-and-over age group! Athletes can participate in this sport for such a long time—and at such advanced ages—because of its low- to no-impact nature and the fact that it enables one to focus on technique and effective movement. Science tells us that at a certain point in life we stop getting stronger and gaining endurance; however, even though you may not be able to get faster after a certain point, swimming always gives you a chance to get better. Let’s move on now to the steps to swimming success, which enable you to learn and practice skills that provide a solid foundation for lifelong enjoyment! xviii --- Page 20 Text --- Step 1 Floating The goal of this first step is to move from a vertical position to the horizontal neutral position that serves as the platform for swimming in all four competitive strokes. This step also helps you become comfortable in the water. By the end of this step, you should be able to • transition from vertical to floating on your back, • transition from vertical to floating on your front, • balance on your center of buoyancy in a streamlined position on your back, and • balance on your center of buoyancy

done from the side of a deep pool with a few modifications. Back Floating With Arms Extended The objective here is to lie back on the water with your arms and legs spread out for balance, almost like a starfish, and float without movement (figure 1.1). Before you 1 --- Page 21 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success try it, here are a couple of mental cues to help you quickly succeed. The first cue addresses head position. Imagine having a dot on the top of your head that must stay wet. Many swimmers are uncomfortable having the head so far in the water, especially when water goes into the ears, but the water will come back out! The second cue addresses body position. The goal is to keep your spine as elon- gated and horizontal as possible. If you feel your feet sink, do not crunch with your abs but rather push your navel to the top of the water. Some swimmers also find it helpful to close their eyes in order to concentrate on how it feels to balance in the water. Remember the teeter-totter—the minute you lift your head, your hips go down.

Here again, the mental cue is that your face, chest, hips, and toes should all be at the surface—only this time they should also all be in the same line along the axis of your body. 3 --- Page 23 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 1.2 Back FloaTing in a T PosiTion Preparation Execution 1.

progression involves bringing your hands in to the sides of your body. As you become more comfortable with this balanced position, you can try a more advanced floating technique. From your sides, bring your hands up above your head, stretching to the longest possible position (figure 1.3). This is a more advanced floating skill, and succeeding at it is a major accomplishment; in fact, some people who have difficulty mastering it still go on to become very accomplished swimmers. Once you have mastered these skills, it is time to practice them with modifications and drills. Figure 1.3 Back FloaTing in a sTraighT line Preparation Execution 1. Begin by checking the water 1.

To practice going from vertical to horizontal, use the following series of drills. They can be performed in deep water if you are comfortable in that environ- ment and possess at least a beginning level of swimming skill. Otherwise, do them in water no deeper than neck level. Back-Floating Drill 1 Push-off on your Back In this drill, you are positioned at the side of the pool, facing the wall, with both hands on the gutter or deck. Your feet should be on the wall and your knees and toes point- ing up toward the surface of the water. Lean your head back (looking up), release your hands from the side of the pool, gently push off with your feet, and assume a relaxed floating position. For many swimmers, this drill requires more than one try. Here is the sequence once again: lean head back, release hands, and gently push off with feet. You have succeeded when you can do the drill repeatedly with your legs together and your arms crossed. The purpose of this drill is to help you get skilled at and comfortable with going from

the sequence once again: lean head back, release hands, and gently push off with feet. You have succeeded when you can do the drill repeatedly with your legs together and your arms crossed. The purpose of this drill is to help you get skilled at and comfortable with going from a semivertical position to a horizontal back float. To increase diFFiculTy • Push off harder. To decrease diFFiculTy • Have your coach or instructor hold your head to ensure that it stays above the water. • Keep your arms at your sides or out perpendicular to the body. • Hold a kickboard across your chest. 6 --- Page 26 Text --- Floating Success Check Score Your Success • You can push off and maintain a 1 point: You can float on the water with balanced position. your arms out. • You can stay in the balanced posi- 3 points: You can push off of the wall tion for more than 20 seconds. gently and hold the balanced position for 5 seconds with your arms out. 5 points: You can push off of the wall gently and hold the balanced position for 10 seconds with your arms at your sides. 7 points: You can push off of the wall gently and hold the balanced position for 20 seconds or more with your arms crossed or at your sides. Back-Floating Drill 2 Position This drill is a variation of the previous drill. This time, pick up your feet rather than pushing off of the bottom of the pool; alternatively, you can tread water if you are performing the drill from a vertical position in a deep pool. The drill consists of starting vertical and achieving a horizontal back float, then lifting your head and returning to vertical. It helps you achieve the

of the bottom of the pool; alternatively, you can tread water if you are performing the drill from a vertical position in a deep pool. The drill consists of starting vertical and achieving a horizontal back float, then lifting your head and returning to vertical. It helps you achieve the horizontal back float and attend to how your head position affects your body position. Returning to the teeter-totter analogy, when one end (your head) goes up, the other end (your hips) goes down. Practice this drill several times in order to develop a good sense of balance. To increase diFFiculTy • Use only a kicking motion with your legs or your hands to manipulate your position in the water, but not both. To decrease diFFiculTy • Use both your arms and your legs. Back-Floating Drill 3 Touch your nose This drill builds on the skill of floating on the water in a T position. Assume the hori- zontal back-float position with your arms straight out to your sides, then touch your nose with an index finger while continuing to float. Repeat with the index finger of the opposite hand. This more advanced drill helps you develop not only vertical and horizontal balance but also lateral or side-to-side balance. As you get the hang of it, try passing a tennis ball from one hand to the other while maintaining your balance.

water (figure 1.4). You can try this first exercise while holding your breath. One indicator of success is being able to look straight down at the bottom of the pool while relaxing on the water in a horizontal position with your back straight. After you become comforta- ble in this position, try it again—only this time breathe out slowly. Breath holding causes tension, which can lead a swimmer to sink or struggle with balance; exhaling slowly, on the other hand, aids relaxation and is also a necessary skill for performing the competitive strokes. To control your breathing, rather than exhaling forcefully, breathe out through your nose while humming. 8 --- Page 28 Text --- Floating Figure 1.4 FronT FloaTing WiTh arms exTended Preparation Execution 1.

CorreCtion This problem result comes from curling the back too much. Keep your spine straight and your limbs relaxed and out away from the body for balance. Once you are able to perform this skill successfully for at least a few seconds, it is time to move on to more advanced floating skills. Front Floating in a T Position The next part of this progression takes away some of the surfaces that swimmers use for balance. As with floating on your back, the next skill to master is floating on your front while bringing your legs together. Specifically, repeat the same skill, but this time keep your arms out while bringing your legs together to make a T rather than a starfish (figure 1.5). This skill requires a little more control and ability to relax on the water. Figure 1.5 Front Floating in a t Position Preparation Execution 1. Begin by checking the water 1.

If it is looking forward, then lengthen the neck and look straight down. Front Floating in a Straight Line The last part of this progression involves bringing your hands in front of your body (figure 1.6). As before, imagine your face, chest, hips, and heels all at the surface— only now they are also in the same line down the axis of your body. Once again, you can try this skill while holding your breath until you have a stable floating position, then slowly exhale. You may feel a little like you are sinking as you exhale due to the change in the volume of air in your lungs. This is a more advanced floating skill, and succeeding at it is a major accomplishment; at the same time, most swimmers find it easier than doing the same thing on the back.

Press your chest toward the bottom of the pool and bring your hips up. drills For PracTicing FronT FloaTing As you have learned by now, floating on the front is fundamentally different from floating on the back. Because of being facedown rather than faceup, you do not have the freedom to breathe whenever you want to. The key to becoming comfortable in the facedown position is to practice certain drills, which can move you toward being as comfortable in this position as you are on your back. Front-Floating Drill 1 Push-off Stand at the side of the pool, sink under the water, and draw your feet up to the wall. Next, push off horizontally and work to rise to the surface and float horizontally, as before, by lying on the water. For many swimmers, this drill requires more than one try. Here is the sequence once again: sink under the water, draw your feet up to the wall, and gently push off with your feet.

The sWimming PosiTion The last skills in this step involve using your newfound balance in the water to achieve a swimming position and to master the art of reducing drag force. A good swimming position requires a great deal of balance and a solid foundation that ena- bles you to apply force to the water. As discussed earlier, it is critical to locate your center of balance and be comfortable in the water. Return for a moment to the teeter-totter analogy and the fact that your center of buoyancy lies

balance and a solid foundation that ena- bles you to apply force to the water. As discussed earlier, it is critical to locate your center of balance and be comfortable in the water. Return for a moment to the teeter-totter analogy and the fact that your center of buoyancy lies in the middle of your chest. If you stand poolside with your arms at 14 --- Page 34 Text --- Floating your sides, about two-thirds of your personal teeter-totter—that is, everything from your chest to your feet—lies below your center of buoyancy. In order to achieve a good swimming position, you need to bring the teeter-totter back into balance. To that end, as soon as you raise your arms above your head, about half of your length is above your center of buoyancy and the other half is below it. There is a time when the body is extended in this fashion in each of the four competitive strokes. Finding Your Balance on Your Back If starting with the back float, the objective is to raise your arms above your head and stretch them as far as you can. Be as long as you can from fingertips to toe tips and still maintain a good floating position. Note that in this position, you have very few ways to manipulate the water for lateral balance. Learning balance in this position can prove challenging for people with limited flexibility or limited range of motion in the shoulders. You have succeeded when you can maintain a relaxed floating posi- tion with your hands extended beyond your head. Use the following steps to find your balance while floating on your back.

Make adjustments to the position of your upper back and hips to ensure that the hands, shoulders, hips, and toes are all at the top of the water. Streamlined Floating on Your Back The next skill in floating on your back is to establish a streamlined position (figure 1.7)—one in which you are not only as long as you can be (from fingertips to toe tips) but also as skinny as possible. This streamlining reduces drag force (discussed in step 2) and sets you up to move through the water more effectively in later stages of the learning process. A good streamline involves certain key elements—extending the body into a line as long as possible from fingertips to toe tips, keeping the core tight, and making yourself as skinny as possible—starting at the fingertips and working down from there. 15 --- Page 35 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 1.7 sTreamlined FloaTing on your Back Preparation Execution 1.

People with more flexibility can put their elbows behind the head and try to squeeze the forearms completely together. 16 --- Page 36 Text --- Floating As just mentioned in streamlined floating, head position depends on flexibility. Your torso should be straight, and a good visual for this element is to imagine keep- ing your spine as long as possible; this image helps you keep your head and torso in line.

Your feet and toes should be pointed much like those of a ballet dancer; the exact degree of angle depends on the flexibility of your ankles. Streamlined Floating on Your Front The streamline on the front (figure 1.8) is produced in the same manner as on the back; it is more challenging, however, because your face is in the water. In both posi- tions, success is measured by how well you maintain both the horizontal position in the water and the long, stretched-out position with no movement.

MissTeP You don’t go very far. correcTion Distance traveled differs from person to person. We come in different sizes and shapes, and some swimmers will go farther than others. Keep at it, and those little adjustments will make a difference! ProPulsive Force: DeveloPing The caTch anD The Pull Swim coaches regularly use the terms catch and pull. Roughly, catch means where you anchor your hand or any other frontal surface in the water; it applies to all strokes. Pull refers to the motion that comes immediately after the catch to provide propulsive force. In this step, you work on the general feeling of putting pressure on the water but not on the specific movement patterns for each stroke. That work comes in later steps. The caTch Manipulating the water across all strokes is a key to good swimming. As part of this process, all strokes include a catch phase (figure 2.2), in which the key surface (whether in the form of one hand or both hands) enters the water and begins to get perpendic- ular to the direction in which you are going. For a mental representation of the catch phase, swimmers think about anchoring the hand

### Swimming STEPS TO SUCCESS_full_text.txt
catch phase (figure 2.2), in which the key surface (whether in the form of one hand or both hands) enters the water and begins to get perpendic- ular to the direction in which you are going. For a mental representation of the catch phase, swimmers think about anchoring the hand in the water, which hinges on three factors. The first factor involves water movement. Turbulent water (as in a washing machine) makes it hard to establish an anchor since the water is already moving. To minimize this problem, find water that is not disturbed in front of you and stretch to reach it. The second factor involves the pitch or angle of the hand(s). Recall that it is almost always best to put pressure on the water in a direction perpendicular to your direction of travel. As a general rule, your fingers should almost always be pointed slightly down on each stroke in order to encourage at least your hand to be perpendicular to your direction of travel. The last factor is strength. If you do not yet have the strength to hold the water, your hand will waffle through it. Alternatively, being unable to hold the water may relate to bad balance, which can weaken the propulsive force enough that it does not overcome the drag force. Both of these issues can be corrected over time through practice. 24 --- Page 44 Text --- Manipulating the Water Figure 2.2 Basic caTch Preparation 1.

Drill For The caTch The best way to develop kinesthetic awareness or feel for the water is to practice in-water drills that minimize other factors. The best drill for this is the dig. Catch Drill Dig This three-part drill is best done in water in which you can stand. Using a stopwatch, measure how long it takes you to walk as fast as you can from one end of the pool to the other; record your time. Then repeat the walking exercise, but this time also use your hands to sweep water out of your way laterally, as if plowing the water one arm movement at a time. Once again, record your time. Next, use an overhand over-the- water motion to accomplish the same task and record your time. Which technique works best for you? (Simply walking should produce your slowest time.) Could you feel your hands anchoring in the water and pulling forward? You might repeat the drill a few times to ensure that you have done it correctly. To increase DiFFiculTy • Pull forcefully with your hands. • Pull quickly with your hands. To Decrease DiFFiculTy • Walk at an easy pace, letting your hands provide balance. • Use both arms at the same time. 26 --- Page 46 Text --- Manipulating the Water Success Check Score Your Success • You can make

water. With your hands in a natural, relaxed position and slightly cupped, rotate your thumbs down so that your palms are angled slightly rather than parallel to the pool bottom. Next, sweep your hands outward, making sure to keep your elbows straight. You should feel pressure from the water on your hands and forearms. Once your hands are about 2 feet (0.6 m) apart, rotate your thumbs up and your little fingers down so that, once again, your palms are slightly angled—only this time toward each other rather than away—and move your arms back to the original position. Again, keep your elbows straight. Repeat this motion several times and adjust the pitch of your palms to get a good feel for the water. As you progress, angle your fingers down slightly as well. The sculling motion creates higher pressure on the palm side of your hand and lower pressure on the back of your hand, thus providing propulsive force. 27 --- Page 47 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 2.3 sculling Preparation 1.

takes time to master. It requires movements that are not fast, rigid, or mechanical but slow, controlled, and fluid. Use slow, rhythmic move- ments and make sure that your hands never stop; they should be sweeping either out or in at any given time. Failure to master this skill does not prevent a person from swimming, but mastering it enables greater proficiency in later stages of the learning process. Repeat the drill several times, experimenting with hand angle and positioning to see what works best for you in creating propulsion. To develop a good catch, you must feel where the water pressure is on your hands and forearms! To increase DiFFiculTy • Do not use a pull buoy.

KicKing When done correctly, kicking is a powerful part of swimming. The first kick to master is the flutter kick (figure 2.4), which is part of both freestyle and backstroke swimming. It is performed with alternating leg movements designed to put pressure on the water via both up and down movements. The more surfaces you engage in applying pressure, the better. The basic idea here is to initiate the kick in the hip; it is also helpful to use the strong muscles of the core for propulsion, and that technique is

pressure on the water via both up and down movements. The more surfaces you engage in applying pressure, the better. The basic idea here is to initiate the kick in the hip; it is also helpful to use the strong muscles of the core for propulsion, and that technique is addressed in future steps. For now, focus on the basics of kicking as a propulsive force. The following drill progression helps you master the flutter kick. The first part of the progression helps you develop an effective mental image of what your legs are 29 --- Page 49 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success supposed to do. Of course, creatures evolved for swimming use well-adapted body parts to make movements that are long and fluid—for example, the movements of a fish, dolphin, or whale tail. Humans are at a disadvantage in this regard because we have solid bones in our legs rather than reticulated vertebrae, making us less flexible for fluid movement. In compensating for this deficit, it helps to envision the move- ment that you want. You might imagine, for instance, that the knee and ankle of each leg are connected by a rubber band. This image helps you keep your legs long and loose as you drive motion from your lower core. Figure 2.4 FluTTer KicKing Preparation 1. Get in the water and grab the gutter. 2. From a standing position facing the wall, kick your legs up to the surface and make your body horizontal (parallel to the pool bottom). 3. At this stage, it is okay to use your fore- arms and the wall to help you achieve a a horizontal position and to have your head out of the water. 4. Keep your legs as long and loose as possible (do not actively point your

it is now time to use your legs to manipulate and put pressure on the water. As your feet get to the surface, keep in mind that your goal is to put pressure on the water, which means that your legs must be in the water. Many novice swimmers equate kicking hard with big splashes; in reality, however, those splashes indicate that the energy exerted is being absorbed by the water rather than benefitting the swimmer. Try to have just your heel—rather than your whole foot—break the surface of the water. A quick head-to-toe check with the following questions in mind will help to make sure you are performing the skill correctly. 1. Are your arms extended all the way out? 2. Is your core long, or are you doing a “crunching” motion? 3. Is your pelvis tucked under rather than staying flat, thus causing your feet to sink? 4. Do you feel the effort in your glutes and upper thighs, which indicates that you are using your whole leg and core? Or do you feel it in your quads, near your knees, which indicates that you are using only your lower legs? 5. Are your ankles stiff or loose? Loose is good. MissTeP You splash a lot. correcTion To achieve propulsive force, get your feet (and as much other leg surface as possible) in contact with the water. Keep your legs long and loose. MissTeP You don’t go anywhere when you kick. correcTion Rather than point your toes or make your leg stiff, imagine curling your toes. This approach keeps your feet flexed but prevents your legs from being stiff. 31 --- Page 51 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Drills For FluTTer KicKing Once you have gone through all of these helpful cues and can feel the pressure

KicKing WiThouT a KicKBoarD Once you have mastered the skill with the kickboard (using the Kickboard drill to practice), it is time once again to put your propulsive kicking force to the test. Repeat the process just described, but this time do it without the assistance of the kickboard (figure 2.5). The goal is to kick in a streamlined position. If you were able to do so with a kickboard, then this transition should be a little easier. The new challenge here is that when you breathe, you should use the same sculling motion described ear- lier in this step. Simply sweep your hands out and in rhythmically to apply enough pressure on the water to allow you to lift your head for a quick breath. You can then continue with a freestyle stroke. Once you have mastered this technique—and it may take a few tries—it is time to move to flutter kicking on your back. 33 --- Page 53 Text

FluTTer KicKing on your BacK Flutter kicking on your back (figure 2.6) differs slightly from kicking on your front. Since you are on your back, the kicking motion is up for the most part (you will learn more about that later). Once again, it is helpful to develop an effective mental image—in this case, that of a soccer ball floating on the water that you kick up into the air with the top of your foot. This mental image helps you apply pressure in the right places and recruit the proper muscles. As with kicking on your front, imagine the joints of each leg being connected by a rubber band; staying long and loose is still a key. Remember both your mental image and the feeling of pressure on the water from both the tops

Your knees keep breaking the water’s surface. correcTion Hold a kickboard with both hands down at your hips, extending the kickboard over your knees. Now try the kicking motion again; if you feel your knees touching the board and making it bounce up and down, then you are not finishing your kick underwater and are prob- ably leading with your heels or bicycling your kick. 35 --- Page 55 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Drills For KicKing WiThouT a KicKBoarD As you develop kicking proficiency, the following drills will help you to not rely on any equipment for balance or assistance. Boardless Kicking Drill 1 Kicking on your Back or your Front Once you have achieved propusion in this position on the back, repeat this same part, the flutter kick on the back, but with your hands now above your head in a streamlined position. Doing so requires you to change your position on the water slightly—your spinal curvature will change—in order to compensate for not having your hands at your sides to help with balance. As before, you should feel the effort in your lower core, specifically there will be muscle contraction and fatigue in your upper thighs and glutes. If you have trouble achieving propulsion, do a simple hands-to-toes check for positioning and technique to ensure that you are doing it right. Once you have mastered this on your back, try the same on your front. When you go to breathe, rotate the head to the side as with the kickboard drill. To increase DiFFiculTy • Drop one arm.

DolPhin KicK The next propulsive motion to learn is that of the dolphin, or butterfly, kick. Though somewhat similar to the flutter kick, this technique for manipulating the water is a little more difficult to master. Instead of alternating the legs, this kick keeps the legs together as if they were bonded, thus mimicking closely the motion of a dolphin’s tale. The advantage of this kick is that it applies more surface area to the water to produce more propulsive force. Dolphin Kicking at the Wall Unlike the flutter kick, this kick (figure 2.7) derives its power from the middle part of the core—from the lower part of the rib cage down through the pelvis. Let the strong muscles of your core initiate most of the work. Your legs should stay together the entire time, and, as with the flutter kick, they

To correct this misstep and produce a propulsive kick, hold a kickboard with your hands down at your hips, extending the kickboard over your knees. Now try the kicking motion again; if you feel your knees touch- ing the board and making it bounce up and down, you are not finish- ing you kick underwater and are probably leading with your heels or bicycling your kick. 40 --- Page 60 Text --- Manipulating the Water Figure 2.9 Dolphin KicKing on Your BacK Preparation 1.

pressure on the water. d 46 --- Page 66 Text --- Manipulating the Water Breaststroke Kick With Propulsion Now that you feel the pressure on the water, it is time to ensure that it is propulsive pressure by moving through the water (figure 2.12). The next part of the progression involves lying on your back in the neutral position described in step 1 with your hands at your sides for balance. Once you have achieved equilibrium, draw your heels up while trying to keep your upper legs underwater. This is slightly different from being on the wall but involves the same type of movement. Once your heels are close to your hips, rotate your heels out so that they are wider than your knees, then sweep them together. As before, this motion is more about pressure on the water than about the speed of the movement. Squeeze your ankles together. Did you move? The pressure on the water should have caused you to move headfirst. Once you have completed one kick, return to the neutral position and let your momentum fade. Repeat the same motion until you are comfortable with it. Figure 2.12 BreasTsTroKe KicK WiTh ProPulsion Preparation 1. Perform the wall exercise for the breaststroke kick with both legs first. 2.

This action allows your upper arm to be more vertical without reach- ing behind your back, which is not an easy position to attain and expends considerable energy. 55 --- Page 75 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Drills FOr arMsTrOkes The fastest and most efficient freestyle swimmers—whether in a race or in the work- out pool—tend to share certain characteristics. The hands always pass in front of the swimmer; the hands and forearms are perpendicular to the direction of travel for the maximum amount of time; and the hands accelerate throughout the course of the stroke under the water. To develop these characteristics, use the following drills. Note that some of the drills involve overcorrection of common flaws, but all of them help you develop elements of good freestyle. Armstroke Drill 1 catch-Up This drill helps you with balance, rhythm, and armstrokes; it also helps you develop great kinesthetic awareness and is especially helpful to tactile learners. To perform this drill, stand on the pool deck and form the index finger and thumb of your left hand into an L shape with the other fingers also extended. Next, create the mirror image of that shape (i.e., a backward L shape) with your right hand. Now, without looking, raise your hands above your head and try to touch just the tips of your thumbs together. In the pool, lie in a horizontal position in the water. This is the same position to which your hands will recover as one hand “catches up” to the other. Make sure that only the tips of your thumbs touch each other, thus leaving your arms

of your thumbs together. In the pool, lie in a horizontal position in the water. This is the same position to which your hands will recover as one hand “catches up” to the other. Make sure that only the tips of your thumbs touch each other, thus leaving your arms about head- width apart. As you start the catch, make sure that you are doing the drill slowly enough to concentrate on getting your fingers down and your elbow up and pushing all the way through. You can expect some body rotation, which works to your advan- tage. As a larger portion of your body is out of the water, the coefficient of drag for air is much lower than that of water, which is more than 500 times as dense. This larger coefficient means that the more of you that is in the water, the more drag force needs to be overcome. Perform this drill with a comfortable rhythmic flutter kick. TO increase DiFFicUlTy • Close your eyes as before and complete 10 armstrokes in a 25-yard (or 25-meter) pool, making sure that only your thumb tips touch. • Perform six kicks per armstroke.

Armstroke Drill 2 Underwater recovery This is a great drill for focusing on just the catch and the pull. Lie flat in the water, then catch and pull with one arm and then with the other. As you finish the stroke at your thigh, instead of recovering your hand and arm over the water, slide your hand forward as far as you can to catch up with your other hand, then repeat with your opposite arm. This approach reduces the need to worry about the recovery. TO increase DiFFicUlTy • Perform six kicks per stroke.

Some competitors swim flatter, with little rotation, whereas others swim through the hips with considerable rotation. Both approaches can be correct, depend- ing on the swimmer, but the most sustainable recreational swimming allows for most people to use the core to aid in rotation rather than relying on spinal flexibility. Some swimmers have more flexibility and strength in the spine and torso, allowing them to twist easier. Rotation Drill 1 Tap your head This drill gives you feedback about where your hands are in relation to the centerline of your body and your axis of rotation, as well as the vertical position of your head. It also compels you to rotate your body to perform the drill correctly. With all that said, the drill itself is very simple. Gently touch your fingertips to the crown of your head on the recovery, then place your hand in the water to recover for the next catch and pull. As in the catch-up drill, wait until one hand has completely recovered before beginning the next catch. TO increase DiFFicUlTy • Perform six kicks per stroke.

BreaThing As land-based creatures, we cannot process oxygen out of water as fish do; therefore, we must find a way to breathe air while swimming. In freestyle, this need is met by rotating the head so that the mouth and nose are out of the water at a good time during the stroke cycle (figure 3.4), thus allowing the swimmer to breathe without interrupting his or her rhythm. The best way to do so is to rotate the face out of the water as an arm is finishing a stroke at the thigh and beginning the recovery. The rotation is initiated at the shoulder and hip, and the head follows. This technique is less about rotating the neck and more about proper positioning. There is a bow wave with the forward propulsion that allows for a

is finishing a stroke at the thigh and beginning the recovery. The rotation is initiated at the shoulder and hip, and the head follows. This technique is less about rotating the neck and more about proper positioning. There is a bow wave with the forward propulsion that allows for a trough to be pro- duced; the depth and utility of that differ from swimmer to swimmer. A bow wave in the world of fluid mechanics is a wave that is produced by the vector displacement of water by another object. The size of the crest and trough produced depends on the mass, velocity, and displacement buoyancy of the object. As the body moves through the water, the crown of the head will cause the water in front of it to increase in pressure as the head moves forward. The water will seek equilibrium from this high pressure state by moving to a lower pressure. Due to the incompressibility of water, the water molecules “choose” a direction to go with some moving down and others moving up or to the side with and infinite number of vector possibilities. The rising part is offset by a falling part producing both a crest and a trough which is below the waterline and will be helpful when trying to rotate the mouth and nose toward the air to breathe. The objective here is to get your air as quickly as possible so that you can get your face back in the water before your hand finishes the recovery, thus readying you for the next catch. 62 --- Page 82 Text --- Freestyle Figure 3.4 single-sTrOke BreaThing Preparation 1.

stroking side. The timing of this drill is crucial. It must be done slowly, and the shoulder of the stroking arm should be touching your ear when you breathe. In addition, your stroking arm should be fully extended until your face is back in the water to initiate the catch. Repeat the process by switching arms. Breathing on both sides is a great skill to master, but many swimmers prefer one side or the other. Forty years ago, coaches advocated that one needed to learn to breathe on both sides in order to be a good swimmer. Enter Grant Hackett, multiple world-record holder and Olympic champion, who breathed exclusively on the right side. Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian in history, does the same thing. In addition, forcing the issue of breathing on both sides detracts from the needed focus on your propulsive movements. The breathing question can be addressed (if at all) once you progress far enough to work with a swim coach. TO increase DiFFicUlTy • Perform six kicks per stroke.

It is not designed to have swimmers hold their breath. The numbers (3, 5, 3, 7) indicate how many strokes you should take between breaths per 25 yards. In other words, for the first 25 yards, breathe every three strokes; for the second 25, breathe every five strokes, and so on. This drill is challenging even when done slowly and with effective movements, and the odd numbers cause an alternating of the breathing pattern. This alternat- ing pattern is a great skill to have, especially for racers, triathletes, and open-water swimmers. It helps with having a faster breathing rate at higher workload levels, and it can aid in navigation for open-water swimmers.

modern backstroke led to several technique changes, as well as revised notions of how to swim the stroke most effectively. The original back- stroke was performed with the arms straight underwater and somewhat loose on the over- the-water recovery, almost as if it were the front crawl or freestyle turned upside down. Later, Australian swimmers used a bent-arm pull and developed a stroke closer to what is recognized as backstroke today. The great advantage of backstroke over other strokes is that the swimmer’s face is out of the water. In addition, swimmers who master the backstroke develop great balance on the water, which also benefits their freestyle stroke. In this step, you will develop the following skills: • Horizontal body line • Rotation on a long axis • Splashless entry and effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Kicking rhythm • Effective breathing • Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these skills, you are well on your way to an effective backstroke. A good horizontal position is a key element of an effective backstroke and also lays the foundation for applying force to the water to achieve propulsion. As mastered in step 1 (floating on your back), the basic position involves lying on the water with your head, hips, feet, and hands at the surface. As you remain stretched out on the water, ensure that you are comfortable and balanced. Basic BacksTroke A good armstroke for the backstroke (figure 4.1) consists of four basic elements that provide the bulk of the propulsive force in swimming: catch, pull, finish (with your palm toward your body, not toward the bottom of the pool), and recovery. At some point when the strok- ing arm is near vertical, rotate your hand so that your pinkie finger leads the

The flags are placed 5 yards from the end of the pool, and most swimmers can take two or three strokes after passing beneath them before reaching the wall. 79 --- Page 99 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 4.2 Multiple-stroke backstroke. Make sure that the lane is clear and equipped with backstroke flags. Assume a bal- anced position on your back. Push off in a streamlined position with your face out of the water and begin stroking with whichever arm is most comfortable for you; take seven to ten strokes. Repeat this process several times, trying to get farther down the pool with the same number of strokes. MissTep You make a lot of splashing and thrashing movements. correcTion Many swimmers tend to rush the arm to the top of the stroke, which causes excessive splash. Remember that the goal here is to slow down the armstroke in order to have a splashless entry. MissTep You continually pull a curtain of water into your face. correcTion As you finish the stroke, rotate your hip on the same side as your stroking arm and the shoulder of your stroking arm toward the sky. This action allows you to exit the water cleanly with your thumb first; if it is done slowly enough, only a little water will drip off of your arm and hand. 80 --- Page 100 Text --- Backstroke Drills For arMsTrokes Armstroke drills help you ensure that you perform a proper entry, catch, and pull by isolating the movements so that you can focus on just one portion of the stroke.

To do it, start kicking with your hands at your sides. Simultaneously raise both arms out of the water, with your thumbs exiting first, then rotate your hands to enter the water pinkies first. Your hands should enter a little more than shoulder-width apart. Bend your elbows slightly while catching the water with your hands and pulling down toward your thighs.

Ideally, you get a deep, effective catch and pull by using your body for rotation (figure 4.3) rather than “faking it” by finishing the stroke with your palm under your hip to force the hip over. The latter approach also forces you to lift your arm all the way back to the surface and creates extra drag. Rotation also reduces drag in another way—by reduc- ing your cross-sectional area on the water. In addition, rotation in the backstroke helps you keep your upper arms in line with your collarbones; imagine a single line extending from elbow to elbow and passing straight through your shoulders. What proper alignment through proper body rotation means for the backstroke is that you never reach behind yourself, which is a good thing since little or no power can be generated there. Reaching behind is similar to trying to push yourself up out of the water with your back to the wall and your hands on the deck. You may be able to do it if you are

MissTep You can’t keep your head still while rotating. correcTion Lay your goggles on top of your forehead without securing the strap around your head. In order to keep the goggles from falling off, you will have to keep your head still! Drills For roTaTion The following drills help you maintain proper body and head positioning while working on your rotation. Keep in mind that each drill may involve an overcorrec- tion of a typical flaw; when you transition back to swimming the stroke, you can smooth everything out to make each motion fluid. Rotation Drill 1 shoulder roll This position drill helps you become aware of how your hip and shoulder are con- nected for the stroke and how to use your core muscles to drive rotation. To do the drill, push off of the wall and begin kicking on your back with your hands at your sides. Once you are comfortable, roll one shoulder up to your chin, making sure that the same-side hip turns with the shoulder. Return to the neutral position on the water and repeat with the opposite shoulder. Go through several cycles of this pattern to ensure that you are comfortable with rotating on the long axis of your body without sinking. To increase DiFFiculTy • Perform six kicks per stroke as part of the stroke mentione d in the intro- duction. • Place the goggles on your forehead with no strap.

• You finish the stroke with your palm on your thigh rather than toward the pool bottom. 87 --- Page 107 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success BreaTHing Although your face is out of the water in the backstroke, you should practice a few techniques for effective breathing as you put your backstroke together. Many swim- mers find it effective to breathe in through the mouth and exhale through the nose. This way, if water is drawn toward your face and falls into your mouth, you can expel or swallow it, which most people find preferable to inhaling it through the nose. In addition, the technique helps many swimmers with control, rhythm, and timing. Since swimming is a rhythmic motion, synchronizing all of the motions of the body including breathing makes for good swimming. Most people can establish a good breathing rhythm after just a little practice. Complete the following to practice backstroke breathing. PreParation 1. Push off of the wall and begin your armstrokes. execution 1. While stroking with your arms, practice exhaling when one arm is pulling and inhaling when the other arm is pulling. MissTep You swallow a bunch of water when trying to breathe. correcTion Are you flat or rotating? Rotate each time, with your recovering side out of the water. MissTep Your hips sink every time you breathe. correcTion Are your hands stopping and meeting at your hips? A good oppo- site-hands rhythm prevents a lot of the stalling encountered by many swimmers. Drill For BreaTHing As with many things requiring a physical effort, swimming is no different, and although your face is out of the water and breathing timing seems less important backstroke breathing is still a skill that should be mastered. 88 --- Page 108 Text --- Backstroke Backstroke Breathing Drill Backstroke Breathing

They also inhale through the mouth and exhale through the nose. If you have ever gotten water up your nose while swimming the backstroke, you know that it is not a pleasant experience. Make sure that you have the breathing pattern down by following these instructions. Ensure that the lane is clear. Ensure that backstroke flags are in place. Push off in the streamlined position. As you break the surface, exhale through your nose. Choose which arm is your inhale arm and which is your exhale arm. Start slowly and breathe in through your mouth on one armstroke and out through your nose on the opposite armstroke. Experiment to find out which pattern works best for you. Increase your effort and velocity while maintaining control. To increase DiFFiculTy • Perform six kicks per stroke.

shooters This drill helps you develop both your kicking and your body positioning. To perform the drill, sink underwater, achieve a streamlined position on your back, and push off of the wall forcefully. Then start kicking as fast as you can in order to go as far as you can underwater, keeping in mind that of course you will need to come up for air. Remember that your body position dictates your depth; if your head is down you will stay down, but the moment you lift your head or look toward your feet you will rise to the surface. Many swimmers use a nose clip to prevent water from going up the nose; it can also be prevented by exhaling slowly through your nose. Repeat this drill several times to increase your distance from the wall.

backstroke. Unlike freestyle, in which your hands pass above your head and almost “catch up” to each other, backstroke is a hands-opposite type of stroke.

are well on your way to an effective breaststroke. The breaststroke is the only one of the four competitive strokes that derives its propulsive force equally from the pull and the kick; therefore, you should give equal attention to both elements. This double focus is one factor that makes the breast- stroke so elusive for some swimmers. At any level, if you look across the race pool, you will find a greater variety of styles being used for the breaststroke than for any other competitive stroke. Some swimmers use a wider pull or kick, whereas others use a quicker stroke rate and still others a longer rate. Bottom line: there is no agreed- upon best way to do this stroke. 99 --- Page 119 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success As with the other strokes, however, there are certain basic movements that pro- vide propulsive force and minimize drag. More specifically, though it is true that you can have a weaker kick in the freestyle or backstroke and still muscle your way through; the same cannot be said of the breaststroke. Therefore, the first element to focus on in the breaststroke is a good kick. BreasTsTroke kick The following skills and drills will help you master what is the most complex of strokes: the breaststroke. The first of these skills is mastering the breaststroke kick (figure 5.1). Figure 5.1 BreasTsTroke kick Preparation 1. Make sure the area is clear and you have ample space to perform the skill. 2.

than 12 inches (30 cm) apart. 5 points: You can go 25 yards in 15 or more kicks • You can go 25 yards on your front with ease. 7 points: You can go 25 yards in fewer than 15 kicks. The pull The second propulsive element of the breaststroke is the pull (figure 5.2). Unlike free- style and backstroke, each of these movements is independent of the other; therefore, timing is crucial. First, focus on developing a really good breaststroke catch-and-pull phase. The difference is that the hands are not stacked one on top of the other as in the preceding skill. The catch and the pull are two parts of the same motion. The release from the pull position is achieved by bringing the elbows together under the body while simultaneously moving the hands forward. Here is an effective trick for thinking about these movements together. Imagine that you are scraping cake batter out of a bowl with your pinkie fingers, then pushing it to someone else. Your hands accelerate throughout the catch-and-pull phase until reaching the neutral position again. Your hands should never go past your shoulders. If they do, you will have to bring them forward, making a propulsive movement in a direction opposite of the way you are swimming. You will then have to start again after this motion makes you stop, thus requiring more energy to accelerate. Figure 5.2 BreasTsTroke pull Preparation 1. Make sure that you have enough space to perform the drill. 2. Lie in the neutral position on your front with your arms extended and your palms down—almost in a stream- lined position. a 104 --- Page 124 Text --- Breaststroke Execution 1.

pull in the breaststroke is just as important as the kick—and more important for some swimmers who are not as good at the kick portion. To develop an effective pull, it is helpful to isolate this part of the overall stroke. More specifically, the pitch of your hand and your elbow positioning are just as important here as they are in the other strokes. The elbows-up position allows you to pull with more than just your hand. Use the following drills to develop a pull with good propulsive force. Pull Drill 1 Breaststroke pull With freestyle kick This drill isolates the pull by using an easier kick and alleviating timing concerns. To perform the drill, lie on your front and kick freestyle with your hands out front. For every six kicks, perform one breaststroke pull. To increase DifficulTy • Kick faster—eight times or more per stroke. To Decrease DifficulTy • Use fins to prevent stalling. • Use a pull buoy and do not kick at all. 106 --- Page 126 Text --- Breaststroke Success Check Score Your Success • You can feel the water on both 1 point: You can go 10 yards. your hands and your forearms. 3 points: You can go 25 yards. • You can go 25 yards on your 5 points: You can go 25 yards in 10 or front in nine pulls with ease. more pulls. 7 points: You can go 25 yards in nine or fewer pulls.

BreaThinG One of the many advantages of the breaststroke is that you can breathe on every stroke. The exact timing of this breath is an important part of the rhythm of the breast- stroke (figure 5.3). As a result, before you start to put it all together for a complete breaststroke, it is a good idea to practice your breathing in isolation. While perform- ing the following drills, lift your head to breathe; the key is to do so at the right time and in the right manner. With the other pressures of laminar flow of water against the chest providing lift on the water, this movement should be sufficient to get your mouth and nose out of the water. Some swimmers will be higher and others lower; it is very specific to each swimmer. 107 --- Page 127 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 5.3 BreasTsTroke BreaThinG Preparation 1. Lie on

Instead of lifting your head per se, use the outsweep to generate lift so that all you need is a simple forward push of your chin. 3. Breathe out while your face is in the water. b MissTep You breathe too late and your hand stops under your chin. correcTion Think about trying to quickly touch your elbows together under your chest.

The following drills will help you establish a good head position and help with breathing. Breathing Drill Tennis Ball 2 This drill helps you maintain proper head position while going to get air or breathing in breaststroke. To perform the drill, place a tennis ball beneath your chin and hold it to your chest. This action keeps your neck in line and prevents you from coming up too high when you breathe. Swim the regular breaststroke and try breathing both earlier in the stroke and later in the stroke to find out which works best for you. Avoid pushing down on the water with your palms.

the breaststroke. To work on your timing, you can use a few simple drills that empha- size it. The secret to the breaststroke hinges on the fact that half of its propulsive force comes from the kick and the other half from the pull. The key is not to do both at the same time. The proper rhythm is one kick, one pull and breath, and a return to the stretched-out position. 109 --- Page 129 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Drills for TiMinG anD rhyThM Because propulsion in the breaststroke derives equally from the kick and the pull, it is crucial to maximize the efficiency of each element. Get it wrong and you end up being very slow. The key is to make sure that you do not kick when pulling and vice versa. The following drills include some overcorrections of typical problems but should help you separate the two movements so that you can develop a good rhythm. Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 1 Two-hippopotamus Breaststroke This is a slow drill that helps you with your timing. It is performed by pushing off of the wall in the streamlined position. Do one breaststroke kick, then wait while count- ing “one hippopotamus . . . two hippopotamus.” Next, pull and breathe as described earlier and shoot forward before kicking again. This approach teaches the indepen- dent movements of the arms and legs. To increase DifficulTy • Count to “three hippopotamus.” To Decrease DifficulTy • Use a pull buoy far above your knees and kick.

Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 2 Two kicks per stroke This classic breaststroke drill increases your awareness of timing and body posi- tion; it also helps you with balance. It is performed by simply kicking twice in the stretched-out position with your hands far forward (but not on top of each other) and kicking twice per catch–pull sequence. Keep your head down with a long neck during each pair of kicks.

BreasTsTroKe PullouT The modern breaststroke is done with what is referred to as a pullout (figure 5.4), both at the start and during each turn at the wall. To perform the pullout, the swim- mer pushes off the wall underwater (or starts from a dive) in a streamlined position. As the hands separate, they can pull all the way down to the hips just once. The swimmer is allowed to perform one dolphin kick at any time in this part. As the swimmer slows, the hands are brought up the body and close to the body to get into a breast stroke swimming position with the hands out in front. It is at this point that the stroke as described earlier actually begins. 111 --- Page 131 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 5.4 BreasTsTroke pullouT Preparation 1.

As a result, the stroke is highly rhythmic, and in order to do it well you need the lower half of your body to work independently of the upper half. This dynamic involves give and take, and there are many effective styles of breaststroke. One thing, however, is true for them all: If your timing is off, you spend a lot of energy going very slowly—or going nowhere fast. score your success If you scored at least 32 points, then you have completed this step.

It was developed in the 1930s as a way to minimize the drag caused by underwater recovery of the arms in the breaststroke. Early variants of the butterfly (referred to as the butterfly breaststroke) used an over-the-water recovery with a breaststroke kick. This technique was much faster than the breaststroke but required a great deal of strength. It was not until the 1950s that the butterfly was con- sidered a separate stroke from breaststroke, and the use of a dolphin kick was added to the official competition rules governing the new stroke. As mentioned in step 5, the butterfly, like the breaststroke, is considered a “short- axis” stroke but is really a timing-and-rhythm stroke. It does involve rotating on a shorter axis (i.e., through the chest, laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes: • Good body position • Effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Acceleration throughout the stroke •

kickboard, it is time once again to put your propulsive kicking force to the test. Repeat the process just described, but this time do it without the assistance of the kickboard (figure 6.4). The goal is to kick in a streamlined position. If you were able to do so with a kickboard, then this transition should be a little easier. The new challenge here is that when you breathe, you should use the same sculling motion described earlier in step 2: Simply sweep your hands out and in rhythmically to apply enough pressure on the water to allow you to lift your head for a quick breath. Once you have mastered this technique—and it may take a few tries—it is time to move to dolphin kicking on your back. Figure 6.4 Dolphin KicK WiThouT KicKBoarD Preparation 1.

The upstroke of the kick is propulsive, whereas the downstroke is used to propel the arms in the recovery and entry. Once again, it is helpful to develop an effective mental image. As with kicking on your front, imagine the joints of each leg being connected by a rubber band; staying long and loose is still a key.

Many swimmers start off stiff and mechanical in their kicking rhythm; with practice, however, they develop a smoother and much more propulsive kick. Here are a few drills to help you master this skill. Dolphin Kicking Drill 1 Vertical Kicking After you have achieved propulsion in dolphin kicking, work on kicking both up and down. This drill helps you develop a symmetrical kick. Find water deep enough to be over your head, then begin by treading water with your head out and using a flutter kick. Once you are comfortable, switch to a dolphin kick. The goal here is to remain stationary in the water without making much use of your hands. If you kick more forcefully in one direction, you will drift around in the pool. Staying in place, on the other hand, means that you are putting pressure on the water with both the fronts and the backs of your legs. You should feel the pres- sure most on the tops and bottoms of your feet, since they are the body parts that finish off the kick. To increase DiFFiculTY • Do not use your hands at all for balance. • Put your hands on top of your head. • Raise your hands straight above you in a streamlined position.

Dolphin Kicking Drill 2 Kick on Your Back This drill helps you continue to develop a symmetrical kick. Now that you feel the pressure on the water, it is time to ensure that it is propulsive pressure by moving through the water. The next part of the progression for an effective dolphin kick is to lie on your back in the neutral position described in step 1 with your hands at your sides for balance. Begin dolphin-kicking with special emphasis on the pressure on the bottoms of your feet. As with the backstroke flutter kick, keep your knees underwater; do not just “push” at the water with the tops of your feet. Some swimmers find it beneficial to think of curling the toes in order to feel the feet in a stretched-out position while keeping the ankles loose. Important note! You will not be able to see where you are going during this drill. Make sure that the backstroke flags are in place—5 yards from the wall—or have your coach or instructor stop you when necessary!

BuTTerFlY arM recoVerY Many swimmers struggle with arm recovery (figure 6.7) if they perform the pull incorrectly. It is easy for the arms to recover over the water if the hands accelerate through the stroke and finish at or slightly wider than the hips. The reason is that the momentum of the stroke carries the hands through the exit, which means that less effort is required to bring the arms and hands back to the forward position. The key is to finish the stroke fast and feather the hands so that they exit the water smoothly, pinkies out first.

is required to bring the arms and hands back to the forward position. The key is to finish the stroke fast and feather the hands so that they exit the water smoothly, pinkies out first. If the stroke is finished with an acceleration, the forward movement of the arms requires less effort. It should be done in the same position: little fingers up, thumbs down, and forearms and upper arms parallel to the water. The specifics of how the hands enter the water are matters of style. Some swimmers do it thumb first, whereas others rotate the wrists before entry. Regardless of style, one must ensure that the fingers are down as described in the catch-and-pull phase. Therefore, if you use the thumbs-first option, make sure to rotate your fingers and hands to be perpendicular to the direction in which you are traveling. 127 --- Page 147 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 6.7 BuTTerFlY arM recoVerY Preparation 1.

If this movement is done with great force, your hands and arms will recover almost by themselves. If you find yourself struggling to get your hands out of the water, check your positioning and practice the following drills. Butterfly Arm Recovery Drill 1 Dolphin Dive This classic drill helps you get used to the undulating motion and provides buoyant force support while you coordinate the over-the-water recovery. To perform it, stand in waist-deep water with your hands at your sides, then bend at the waist so that your chest is in the water but your shoulders are out. Your chin should touch the water as you look at a spot 8 to 10 inches (20-25 cm) in front of your face. Next, rotate your hands—so that your pinkies are up and your thumbs down— and sweep them forward over the water; near the beginning of the movement, put your face in the water. Now place your hands in the water in front of your shoulders or slightly wider. Push yourself forward off of the bottom and stretch out on the water while pushing your chest and your hips down toward the

near the beginning of the movement, put your face in the water. Now place your hands in the water in front of your shoulders or slightly wider. Push yourself forward off of the bottom and stretch out on the water while pushing your chest and your hips down toward the bottom. This is the same kicking motion described earlier. Pull yourself forward and, when your hands reach your hips, stop and stand up. Repeating this drill causes an undulating motion that serves as the basis for your stroke and allows you time to isolate the recovery por- tion of the stroke.

you perform all elements of the stroke, except that when you finish the stroke you sweep your hands and arms forward and out to the sides, near the surface of the water but still in it. Start with your hands and arms extended out front and lie on the water in the neutral position. Do a dolphin kick, both up and down, as well as a catch and pull. As you finish the pull, sweep your hands and arms out in a semicircular motion with your arms straight. It is okay for your arms to skim the surface of the water. When your hands reach the front, stop and stand up to reset the stroke. When performing this drill, keep your arms straight and lead with your thumbs while in the water. This technique helps with body positioning so you do not get the body too vertical.

BreaThing The timing of the breath is critical to a good butterfly stroke. As with the breast- stroke, breathing at the wrong time during the butterfly stroke cycle not only slows the stroke but also increases the rate of fatigue. However, whereas mistimed breath- ing in the breaststroke mainly makes you slow, mistimed breathing in the butterfly exhausts you and forces you to stop. 130 --- Page 150 Text --- Butterfly To learn when to breathe and how to do so with proper technique, you use a few simple mental cues and drills (figure 6.8). The first cue addresses how high to rise out of the water when getting air. Rising too high reduces momentum and undulation. As a corrective, think of pushing your chin forward rather than lifting your head. The next concern is the timing of your breathing. Many swimmers breathe late. To avoid this pitfall, initiate the forward chin movement as you start your pull and make it a quick breath. How often you breathe depends on your individual needs and development as a swimmer. Conventional wisdom used to recommend breath- ing on every other stroke and leaving your face in the water rather than getting air on each stroke. However, after several Olympians chose to breathe either on every stroke or in a one-two pattern, it became apparent that butterfly swimmers should breathe as often as they need to—but not more.

Position your fingers down and your elbows up while pushing your chin forward. Pull through and accelerate your hands while coming up for air. Flip your hands and arms out, down past your hips, and around in a sweeping motion while also placing your face back in the water and kicking down again. Drills For TiMing anD rhYThM Here are a few simple drills that you can do to emphasize timing. Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 1 1-2-3-4-5 Butterfly This drill separates the propulsive movements. Perform each distinct movement described in the summary of butterfly rhythm, waiting one or two seconds between movements. As you get more comfortable with the movements and with the timing, reduce the wait interval until you are swimming the full-stroke butterfly. Breathe on every stroke if necessary and less often if possible. To do the drill, lie facedown on the water in the neutral position with your hands in front. Then implement the five elements referred to in the numbers of the drill name (1-2-3-4-5 Butterfly): (1) push your chest down, (2) push your hips down and your chest up, (3) pitch your fingers down, (4) pull through, and (5) recover. The idea here is to slow the movements into separate and distinct actions. You can speed up as you become more comfortable with the rhythm. To increase DiFFiculTY • Speed up the rhythm.

To do it, perform one pull for every four dolphin kicks. This technique isolates your hand positioning upon entry and immediately afterward. Lay your hands on the water directly in front of you so that your arms are above the head in an outstretched position like that of Superman when flying. Perform four dolphin kicks to continue moving forward while adjusting your hands and arms if necessary. If you find yourself having to lift your head and pitch your hands up to get back to the stretched-out position, you are driving the stroke too much with your upper body. Instead, think of laying your hands on the water and landing on your armpits. Remember to breathe only in the beginning part of the stroke. To increase DiFFiculTY • Speed up the rhythm.

One variant of this drill involves doing the breaststroke pull and dolphin kick during the breaststroke part; another involves breathing only in the breaststroke portion. This drill allows you to concen- trate on the rhythmic aspect of the strokes. To increase DiFFiculTY • Increase the pace. • Breathe only on the breaststroke portion.

both competitive and recre- ational pool swimming. In competition, an effective turn saves race time when changing direction. For recreational and fitness swimmers, an effective turn maximizes your workout time and enhances your proficiency in the water. Every turn, regardless of the type, consists of four key elements: 1. Approach 2. Exchange 3. Streamline 4. Breakout The approach involves where, when, and how you prepare for the turn. The exchange is the point at which you transfer momentum from one direction to the opposite direction. The streamline is performed when you push off of the wall, and the breakout is where you transition from streamlining to swimming a stroke. In this step, you learn how to perform the most basic turn for recreational swimming, as well as the most advanced turns and transitions used in competitive swimming. Open Turn The most basic and functional turn is the open turn. It was used in early freestyle competitions, as well as backstroke competitions, and is a favorite among recrea- tional swimmers. In this turn, the approach (figure 7.1) is made on the front, and in competition pools it can be gauged by markings on the pool bottom. Specifically, the centerline of each lane has a T shape close to the wall that provides competitive swimmers with a target. When swimming in a pool without this kind of marking, you can take a quick look to judge distance by lifting your head out of the water. Many pools also have a spillover gutter system or a low coping that allows you to grasp the wall with your hands. 139 --- Page 159 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 7.1 Open Turn phase 1: apprOach anD eXchanGe a b Preparation 2.

MissTep You push off of the wall but are not underwater. cOrrecTiOn As your hand leaves the wall, move it over your head to meet your other hand underwater. Delay the push until you sink to the level of your feet. 141 --- Page 161 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success The last part of the turn is the breakout (figure 7.3), which is your transition from the streamlined position to a swimming position. In freestyle swimming, simply push your chin forward. Please note that you should not necessarily lift your head; instead, bring your chin forward, which causes you to rise to the surface gradually. In contrast, lifting your head causes you to become more vertical, thus losing momen- tum and slowing down. Figure 7.3 Open Turn phase 3: BreakOuT Preparation 1. Complete all previous parts of the progression, then push off forcefully. 2. As you push off, make sure that you are streamlined. 3. Begin kicking as described a earlier. Execution 1. Push your chin forward. 2. Forcefully take a first stroke. 3. Your head, shoulders, and hips should all break the sur- face at about the same time. b MissTep You turn over and face the direction in which you want to go. cOrrecTiOn If you are on your side, you should face one of the sides of the pool rather than looking down the lane.

For safety reasons, you should practice this technique only in a pool equipped with backstroke flags. As mentioned in the backstroke step, these are placed 5 yards from the end of the pool. Swimmers also count strokes from the flags to get to the wall, and for many swimmers it takes about three strokes. 142 --- Page 162 Text --- Turns As you approach on your back, roll toward your side, as in freestyle. Make sure not to go past vertical with your shoulders; that is, remain slightly on your back. The exchange is the same as in freestyle, and the streamline is similar except that you push off slightly on your back. The streamline is faceup, and the breakout is the same as before except this time of course transitioning into the backstroke. Figure 7.4 Open Turn fOr BacksTrOke Preparation 1. When approaching on your back, roll toward your side. Do not go past vertical with your shoulders; instead, remain slightly on your back. 2. Push off slightly on your back. 3.

MissTep You push off on top of the water without ever submerging. cOrrecTiOn Be patient while your feet are on the wall. As your arm goes over, breathe out slightly while on your side or back in order to sink before pushing. DriLLs fOr Open Turns The open turn is a great turn to learn first because it is often used by fitness swim- mers. In addition, until the 1960s, it was used by distance swimmers in competition to get more oxygen during turns. The following drills help you master the elements of the turn. Open Turn Drill 1 approach To perform this drill, get in water that is about 3 to 4 feet (1 m) deep. Position your- self two or three yards away from the wall and start by pushing off of the bottom in a streamlined position. Take one freestyle stroke, rotate to your nonstroking side, and reach for the wall. Let your momentum carry you and attend closely to the pool mark- ings. Grab the gutter or coping and pull yourself forward slightly. Try both sides— you will find one more comfortable and easier than the other. Adjust your distance from the wall as needed. TO increase DifficuLTY • Start farther from the

### Swimming STEPS TO SUCCESS_full_text.txt
coping or deck. Point your other arm down the length of the pool underwater. Drive your knees toward your chest and rotate your feet to the wall about 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) underwater. You are now on your side and tucked, with your feet on the wall and one arm pointing down the length of the pool. Sink and touch your hands together so that you are on your side underwater. Do not push; the idea here is to get comfortable in the proper position for pushing effectively. To IncrEasE DIffIculTy • Make sure that your hand leaves the wall before your feet touch, then hold the wall position for three to five seconds. • Raise your hands straight above you in a streamlined position.

2, it is time to work on the streamline and push. This drill is performed in three stages. In the first stage, push off of the wall in a stream- lined position with your head down to control depth. The key is to push off forcefully and go as far as you can. Find markers in the pool or use another means to deter- mine where you come up each time. This is only a push and a streamline—no kick- ing or other movements. In the second stage, glide as far as you can. In the third, rotate from the side to the front while gliding and using only body control. Since you are on your side for the open turn, practice rotating from the side to the front several times. Do the same for the backstroke (rotating to the back). To IncreaSe DIFFIculTy • Combine this drill with the approach and exchange drills.

TwO-hanD TOuch Turn The two-hand touch turn is the one used in competition and recreational swimming for both the breaststroke and the butterfly. To perform this turn, the approach (figure 7.5) is made on the front, and in competition pools it can be gauged by markings on the pool bottom. Specifically, the centerline of each lane has a T shape close to the wall that provides competitive swimmers with a target. Since both the breaststroke 147 --- Page 167 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success and the butterfly are forward-looking strokes, you can also easily sneak a peek at your distance from the wall. Many pools also have a spillover gutter system or a

that provides competitive swimmers with a target. Since both the breaststroke 147 --- Page 167 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success and the butterfly are forward-looking strokes, you can also easily sneak a peek at your distance from the wall. Many pools also have a spillover gutter system or a low coping that allows you to grasp the wall with your hands. This technique reduces your length and thus the resistance during your turn and causes your feet to come up close to the wall for the exchange. Figure 7.5 TwO-hanD TOuch Turn: apprOach Preparation 1. As you approach the wall, take a final stroke and reach for the wall with both hands. 2. Stretch for the wall rather than taking an additional short stroke. a Execution 1. As your momentum carries you into the wall, grasp it (or push away from it with your hands). 2. Drive your knees up toward your chest. 3. Rotate your feet toward the wall. b MissTep You come to a stop before reaching the wall, or you end up with your face very close to the wall or hit the wall with your arm. cOrrecTiOn Take one more stroke, or one fewer, to adjust your distance. MissTep You have to take a half-stroke because you are too close. cOrrecTiOn It is better to be long on the turn than short. In breaststroke competi- tion, the drag is increased and slows you down, and the pull must also be followed by a kick, according to current rules. This could lead to a disqualification, so it is preferable to glide to the wall. 148 --- Page 168 Text --- Turns During the exchange (figure 7.6), your body rotates and you draw one arm back toward the other end of the pool and then extend your

Now, try the drill again, but this time add one or two armstrokes. Adjust your distance until you have a good feel for your momentum and your location relative to the wall.

yards—with two strokes. fLip Turn The flip turn (figure 7.9) is used most commonly in freestyle and backstroke competi- tion but is also widely used by recreational and fitness swimmers. Though competitors initially used the open turn, the flip turn has proven to be faster and more efficient. As with the other two turns, the flip turn involves four key elements. The approach in the flip turn differs from the approach in the other two turns. The exchange involves changing the position of your head and feet; in fact, you are faceup to the surface of the water, a position in which many people experience water flowing into the nose. This annoyance can be prevented by using a nose clip or by exhaling slowly through the nose throughout the turn. The streamline and breakout in the flip turn are the same as in the open turn. The backstroke is a little more complicated, but the movement is the same. After you swim under the backstroke flags and take three strokes, roll over onto your front and per- form the same freestyle turn. The streamline is on the back with no roll to the front. 154 --- Page 174 Text --- Turns Figure 7.9 fLip Turn Preparation 1. Start several yards from the wall and swim a few strokes freestyle. 2.

After all, this is the last chance to push against something solid (until the turn) and to benefit from gravity, so it pays to make the most of it. For all of the strokes covered in this book, the start consists of four basic elements: 1) set, 2) push, 3) entry, and 4) streamline. The set is the posture that you take on the side of the pool or on the starting block. The push is the explosive movement that generates velocity down the pool. The entry is the transition into the water, and the streamline is how you carry that momentum into the water in order to use it as swimming speed. In-Water StartS Of course, many swimmers do not compete, but start skills are still important for them. Beginners and others who cannot dive should look at the sections addressing the streamline and the breakout in the stroke-specific discussions. In-water starts involve simply pushing off from the wall, and they are perfectly legal in most com- petitions. The rules do specify that you must have at least one hand on the wall and must push off of the wall rather than contacting the bottom of the pool. DIve StartS Before you begin this step, make certain that the pool you are using is a safe place to perform a dive start. Many pools either restrict diving or are not deep enough for diving at all. Check with the lifeguard or your instructor to ensure that this particular activity is appropriate at your pool. Depth requirements vary from governing body to governing body, but all require at least 4.5 feet (~1.4 m);

First, not every facility has starting blocks, and those that do often place restrictions on who is allowed to use them and under what circumstances. If you are permitted to use the block—and if you have successful experience in diving from the side of the pool—then you may want to begin working from the block. Starting blocks traditionally stand 20 to 30 inches (0.5-0.75 m) above the water. This may not seem like a great height, but it adds a lot of energy to the start and makes pool depth all the more important. Though traditionally performed from a starting block, this forward dive start can also be done from the side of the pool. Starting blocks may be either removable or permanently installed.

a lot of energy to the start and makes pool depth all the more important. Though traditionally performed from a starting block, this forward dive start can also be done from the side of the pool. Starting blocks may be either removable or permanently installed. They come in a variety of designs, depending on the manufacturer, but generally include a platform angled slightly forward or down toward the water. Some also include a wedge at the back, and this feature is currently considered state of the art for competitive racing blocks. Let’s turn now to the various dive starts. ForWarD or grab Start The forward or grab start (figure 8.3) can be done from the deck or from a block and is used for freestyle, breaststroke, and butterfly. To perform it, stand at the front edge of the block with your toes curled over the edge, then bend at your waist and bend your knees slightly. Next, grab the front edge of the block with both hands; it is very important to keep your neck loose and look down or only slightly forward. This is the set position, in which you should be reasonably comfortable with your center of gravity directly above your feet and ankles. As your feet leave the block, your hips, knees, and ankles should all be on the same line, parallel to the surface of the water, in order to generate maximum forward velocity. Your upper body is angled toward your entry position and your fingers are pointed directly to that spot. As your feet enter the water, you should be 2 to 2.5 feet (0.6-0.75 m) under the sur- face. It will take several attempts to find your ideal depth, which depends on which stroke you are swimming and what is most comfortable to you.

are pointed directly to that spot. As your feet enter the water, you should be 2 to 2.5 feet (0.6-0.75 m) under the sur- face. It will take several attempts to find your ideal depth, which depends on which stroke you are swimming and what is most comfortable to you. After your feet enter the water, you are in the streamline phase. Perform this part of the start as described in the stroke-specific step chapters. 164 --- Page 184 Text --- Starts Remember that at the instant you enter the water, you are traveling at the fast- est speed you will achieve in your swim. Therefore, it is crucial to achieve a tight streamline in order to avoid slowing down and to minimize drag. The streamline for freestyle and butterfly involves powerful kicking at very high frequency, whereas the breaststroke streamline involves the breaststroke pullout. The breakout, once again, is the transition from streamlining to swimming. In all of these strokes, the first few strokes after the streamline are crucial for maintaining the momentum you generated in the start and the streamline. To do so, focus on making your first few strokes powerful and flawless. Figure 8.3 ForWarD or grab Start a bb Set 3. At the same time, bring your hands forward toward the stream- 1.

DrIllS For ForWarD or grab Start Performing a good forward start depends on your ability to generate a great deal of horizontal force and maintain the velocity generated by pushing off of something solid from a significant height. The following drills help you master the forward start by emphasizing each component of a good start. Forward or Grab Start Drill 1 Standing Jump This feetfirst drill isolates the push to help you generate explosive power from either the pool deck or a starting block. From the take-your-mark position, instead of pulling forward with your hands, let go and swing your arms forward. At the same time, push forward as forcefully as possible to get as much forward velocity as you can, then pull your feet up to enter the water feetfirst. Practice this drill several times to see how far down the pool you can get. In competition, start sequencing may vary in several ways. Most meets use whistle commands. First, a series of short whistles from the starter or another official calls com- petitors to the block. A long whistle then signals them to step up on the block (or into the water in the case of backstroke) and get ready to assume the start position. The starter then tells competitors to take their marks, at which time they need to get into the start position and hold it. The start of the race itself is signaled by a horn or whistle. 166 --- Page 186 Text --- Starts to InCreaSe DIFFICulty • Place a marker (e.g., a diving brick) on the bottom of the pool as a target and aim for the spot in the water directly above it. to DeCreaSe DIFFICulty • Start from the deck and just do

The difference in the track start is the start position. In this position, one foot is forward and the other is back, just like track athletes use for their starts. During the 1960s and 1970s, it was used by some U.S. collegiate swimmers, and in the 1980s a few U.S. swimmers became the first to use it in international competition. They were disqualified, but a chal- lenge to the ruling led to the conclusion that regulations did not require both feet to be at the front of the starting blocks. By the 1990s, the technique had become more widespread, and it is now the standard starting technique for most swimmers. It can

Which foot is the best foot to put forward? To answer this question, use the fol- lowing simple methods. First, have a partner or your coach stand behind you. Stand with your own feet together, close your eyes, and have the other person gently push you forward. Whichever leg moves first to stop you from falling is your dominant leg. This fact alone, however, does not make it the best foot to put forward. 169 --- Page 189 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Next, have the other person observe whether your hips are back or forward in your set position. People whose hips sit a little back tend to be faster on the start when they put the dominant leg forward; those whose hips sit forward tend to do better with the nondominant leg forward. In either case, your feet should point straight down the pool rather than at any kind of angle. Ultimately, of course, the only way to tell for sure which approach is right for you is to try them out and see which one gets you farther down the pool. After your feet enter the water, you are in the streamline phase. Perform this part of the start as described for each stroke in previous steps.

Remember that the instant you enter the water, you are traveling at the fastest speed you will achieve in your swim. Therefore, it is crucial to achieve a tight streamline in order to avoid slowing down and to minimize drag. The streamline for freestyle and butterfly involves pow- erful kicking at very high frequency, whereas the breaststroke streamline involves the breaststroke pullout.

In all of these swimming strokes, your first few strokes after the streamline are crucial for maintaining the momentum you generated in the start and the streamline. To do so, focus on making your first few strokes powerful and flawless. In addition, this particular type of start involves a few more variables that must be managed. Whether you have your hips forward or back, your timing, and the amount of verti- cal force you put into the start all influence the entry. If your feet do not enter through the same hole in the water as the rest of the body, you may twist, which will influence the way you streamline. You may have to make adjustments with your body and in your streamline to ensure that you can manage the breakout effectively. MISStep You look up, lose your balance, and fall in.

If you go too shallow, you belly flop; if your angle is too severe, you go to the bottom of the pool.

and the start (figure 8.5) is no exception. The backstroke start can be performed from the deck or a block; either way, it is done in the water with the feet on the wall and the back facing down the pool. For the entry, push off and do a back “dive,” which brings you underwater and sets up the streamline. An effective backstroke start begins, of course, with the set. Competitive blocks are outfitted with grab bars for backstroke, but even then some swimmers opt to use the deck. The set is performed by placing the feet flat on the wall with the elbows bent. Next comes the push, for which the key is timing. The result should be almost a back dive. The most efficient swimmers follow an arc and their feet go from under the water to out of the water and then back through the same hole that the upper body goes through. Strong swimmers get the entire body out of the water at some point and basically go through the same hole as the hands. Depth on the entry differs from that of the chest-down strokes. In the backstroke, the streamline and the dolphin kick are important elements. In fact, one of the fastest recorded backstroke swims was done mostly on an underwater streamline with a dolphin kick. With this in mind, if you are a good dolphin kicker, it works to your advantage to go deeper and longer on the entry. In competition, your streamline is allowed to extend for a maximum of 15 yards. Experiment to find out which head and body positions produce the best streamline for you while keeping you underwa- ter for the correct amount of streamline. Since you are faceup, it is likely that water will go up your nose

Backstroke Curl Drill 1 back Flip One of the most difficult parts of the start is to avoid a flat or pancake start. Foot posi- tioning will allow you to produce maximum force horizontally down the pool. Some years ago, many swimmers—the rules allowed this—curled their toes over the gutter to get a little extra vertical force to almost do a back dive into the water. While you are not allowed to curl your toes over the gutter or deck, it is a good idea to place your feet as close as you can to the top of the water. This drill is performed by throwing your hands and arms back, almost as if trying to touch the bottom of the pool behind you. This action requires you to arch your back more than you do on a regular start. You must also attend to your head position- ing; specifically, make sure to look back toward the bottom of the pool behind you. If you end up vertical with your head down, then you have done the drill correctly.

in which waves and swells can be problematic; however, it is also true for smaller bodies of water, in which even a light chop of small waves can create an issue. Swells and chop are often caused by wind, but they can also be produced by other factors, such as upwellings and tidal changes. Another—and often neglected—aspect of surface conditions involves traffic. It is not recommended that you swim in an area of high boat traffic; interactions between watercraft and swimmers usually end poorly for the swimmer. There may also be surface debris, such as sticks, logs, and trash. An open-water swim plan must also take account of currents and of the geog- raphy—both of the bottom of the body of water and of the immediate shoreline. A swimmer can be carried offshore by a rip current or downstream by river flow, and either situation is dangerous. Therefore, it is crucial to know about any currents or tides, including their strength and direction of flow. As for geography, consider all possible factors. For example, is there a shallow entry or a drop-off? How deep is the water? Is the shore sandy or rocky? Is there any vegetation? In addition, when swimming in a body of water other than a pool (and sometimes even in a pool!), you will encounter some form of biological life. It could be as simple as bacteria, moss, or algae or as complex and intimidating as fish, jellyfish, reptiles, or mammals. This caveat is not meant to discourage you from enjoying a swim in the open water but to stress the importance of knowing what you are getting into. Check with local officials to make sure that your intended swimming location is free from harmful bacteria and other potentially dangerous life forms. Consider also the fact

Check with local officials to make sure that your intended swimming location is free from harmful bacteria and other potentially dangerous life forms. Consider also the fact that some aquatic and marine creatures follow regular patterns of daily or migratory activity. Your best sources for information about such matters are local safety experts and officials. getting in and Starting Before you begin this step, make sure that your chosen body of water is a safe place for swimming. To do so, check with the lifeguard, local officials, or your instructor. In addition, it is critically important to practice all of these drills in a pool or other controlled environment before practicing in open water. Entry Here you bring to bear your geographical knowledge of the immediate shoreline or dock area, as well as what lies beneath the water. When entering from a dock or boat (figure 9.2), always adhere to the maxim “feet first the first time” in order to pre- vent injury. Once you know the starting conditions—and how you are going to enter the water—you can develop skills to help you enjoy competitive and recreational open-water swimming. 185 --- Page 205 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 9.2 Open-Water FirSt-time entry Preparation 1.

At the point where it is too difficult to continue wading, bring your arms to the front a and push forward off of the bottom. 2. Keep your hands in front, let your feet leave the bottom, and push your chest forward. This approach allows you to cover more horizontal dis- tance with less energy than walking. 3. Pull one knee up, find the bottom with that foot again, and repeat the upper-body motion as you draw your other leg past the first leg. 4. Repeat as often as neces- b sary to reach a swimming depth. The preceding skill is practiced in a zero-entry pool, but it can also be used at an open-water venue, as shown in the photos. The zero-entry pool is safer, and many skills can be practiced there first prior to open-water trials. The following missteps and corrections are for performing the drills in an open-water environment. miSStep You run into the water and promptly fall flat after tripping on a rock.

Entry and Start Drill 1 Compact-Jump entry and Swim This drill helps you learn to get into the water from a dock or boat and immediately begin swimming. The object of the drill is to keep your body close to the surface and get to a horizontal position quickly and effectively. The drill requires you to find progressively shallower parts of the pool, down to 3.5 feet (~1 m). Find a suitable pool or body of water, check for any obstructions, and make sure that the conditions are safe. To do the drill, perform the entry as described earlier.

Standing on the side of the pool (or dock or boat), face the direction in which you are going to swim. Jump out away from the side and draw up your knees so that your legs are bent and your feet are under your hips. Extend your arms to your sides while in the air. As you hit the water, sweep your arms forward to absorb the energy from the drop and to keep your head above or near the surface of the water.

The most common way is to use a horizontal sculling motion with the hands while breaststroke-kicking with one leg at a time. This kick is commonly referred to as the eggbeater. People who struggle with the breaststroke kick can use a version of the flutter kick just as effectively. Either of these kicks can be used for this drill. The drill helps you prepare for times when you are stationary in the water and cannot push off of the bottom to get started. To do the drill, perform a sculling action with your hands in front to keep yourself stationary, then kick your legs and hips up to the surface. You must arch your back to keep your head out of the water, but once you are ready to go, just put your face in and start swimming. Find a pool of sufficient depth that has plenty of room to execute the skill. Jump

from a beach or other shore with a shallow and long run out to deeper water. To do the drill, get clear knowledge of the bottom terrain, then wade into ankle-deep water. Continue wading out until the water is at least waist deep, then lean in, almost as if doing the butterfly stroke; be sure that your hands are in front of you before you push off of the bottom. Come up, stand, and repeat as necessary until you are in water of good swimming depth. To do this drill in a pool, find a zero-entry pool or practice by diving over a lane line or noodle in shallow water. If you are in a zero-entry pool, be sure that it has sufficient depth for performing the drill safely. Keep your hands in front of your head when dolphining into the water so that any change in depth is felt by your hands— not your head. You can also dive under a lane line or noodle as if it were a wave coming in to the shore; swimming over such waves is a waste of energy, so it is better to simply duck under them. tO inCreaSe diFFiCulty • Push with one foot while maintaining forward movement with your other leg, as if you were striding on land. tO deCreaSe diFFiCulty • Stop after each dolphin.

Moreover, much of the world’s open water provides you with only a few feet of visibility (if that), which limits the value of lifting your head for vision, especially since doing so can compromise your body position. In addition, without the benefit of a pool marking, most swimmers tend to pull to one side or the other, thus com- pounding the problem of navigation and encouraging you to look up more often than you need to. 191 --- Page 211 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Combine these factors with challenging wind, waves, or currents and you can end up all over the place. To make matters worse, the buoys that mark open-water courses are often are hard to see. In many cases, therefore, it is better to find a more prominent landmark on an opposite shore or some other stationary object to assure you that you are swimming straight (figure 9.4). Here are a few skills and drills to help you ensure that you swim in the right direction. Figure 9.4 In open-water swimming, it’s best to use a prominent landmark when sighting and navigating.

SWitCh drillS The following drills help you not only with sighting during a competition but also with engaging various muscles in a survival situation. The key in both cases is to perform the skills with minimal energy expenditure. Switch Drill 1 Freestyle-to-Breaststroke Switch As mentioned in step 5, the breaststroke is the slowest of the competitive strokes but offers some advantages. Aside from getting to breathe on every stroke, you also get to look forward, which of course is very helpful when you need to quickly check where you’re going while continuing to make progress. In short, the breaststroke allows you to simultaneously get a peek—for example, at a buoy or landmark—and a little air. To perform this drill, swim seven strokes of freestyle followed by three strokes of breaststroke and then go back to freestyle. tO inCreaSe diFFiCulty • Swim multiple cycles of the drill. tO deCreaSe diFFiCulty • Stop after each switch.

First, you get to breathe for a bit with your face out of the water so that you can also clear your goggles or rest tired muscles used in the freestyle. Second, you can sneak a look back and see where you have been to track progress and check heading. To perform this drill, swim seven strokes of freestyle, then roll over and swim three strokes of backstroke before returning to freestyle. During one of the freestyle strokes it is okay to lift your head to see your competition or (in competition or sur- vival situations) to see where you have been in order to judge the current. tO inCreaSe diFFiCulty • Swim multiple cycles of the drill. tO deCreaSe diFFiCulty • Stop after each switch.

Pack swim- ming (figure 9.5) involves a lot of contact and often leaves very little space in the water for just you. As in cycling, the pack moves as a group, and everyone tries to find the right spot in which to gain an advantage. Also as in cycling, drafting gives swimmers a little extra lift and makes the work a bit easier. Another benefit is that you get to let someone else navigate—assuming he or she swims straight! Unlike in cycling, the ideal swimming draft is done to the side and back rather than directly behind. To get the idea, think of how geese fly. Aim to have your head somewhere between the lead swimmer’s hip and her or his ankle; the exact position- ing depends on the swimmer’s size, shape, velocity, and swim conditions. Figure 9.5 When swimming in a pack, you will come into contact with other swimmers, so it’s important to learn how to draft. 195 --- Page 215 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success To perform this technique, you and a friend or instructor both leave the wall, the friend or instructor leaving first.

In the boundary layer between fluids and other materials, the velocities shed by and object provide vectors of force in a variety of directions. If you can minimize the energy while maintaining a velocity by making your strokes long and smooth, then you have found a good drafting posi- tion. Try both the right and left sides until you determine which one you like best. PreParation 1. Find two swimmers to help you with this skill. 2. Make sure that you have a free lane in which to practice the skill. 3. Ensure that no swimmers are coming the other way. execution 1. Have the first swimmer start by swimming down the center of the lane. 2. After waiting a second or two, the second and third swimmers can start at the same time on either side. 3. The draft position is slightly to the side, much like geese use when flying in an echelon formation. 4. The best draft position is with the head somewhere between the lead swim- mer’s hip and ankle. 5. Adjust your draft position forward and backward in this zone until you can feel the benefit of the draft. miSStep You end up getting splashed in the face and constantly swallow water.

The positioning differs as well. In cycling and auto racing, the ideal draft position is often behind the lead cyclist or driver, but this is not true of swimming. In swimming, the swimmers can be off to the side. To practice your position and drafting skills, use the following drills. Pack-Swimming Drill 1 three-person drafting In a 25-yard pool, work with two other swimmers. Start one right after another and have the second and third swimmers get into drafting position. Switch lead swim- mers every 25 yards.

To per- form the drill, start by rolling inward and taking one backstroke stroke in a twisting motion. As your backstroke arm reaches for the catch, your body width matches that of the lead swimmer, and after completing the roll, your next stroke is on the opposite side. In other words, depending on which side you start on, you either do a back- stroke with your left hand and roll to the front with a right-hand stroke, or vice versa. This maneuver puts you on the other side of the lead swimmer’s feet without losing momentum. It is a little tricky, and you should practice it in a pool before trying it in an open-water environment. tO inCreaSe diFFiCulty • Swim at least 75 yards without stopping. tO deCreaSe diFFiCulty • Stop after each 25 yards. • Wear fins.

Changing direCtiOn Most open-water swims require you to turn or at least change direction. Doing so without losing momentum is an art form. When swimming freestyle, the human body is just not meant to bend laterally very much; humans are much better at bend- ing forward at the waist. Having said that, one of the more effective turns involves taking one backstroke stroke and bending at the waist so that your upper body points in the direction in which you want to go after the turn. Your legs will follow. This technique allows you to change direction without breaking rhythm, and swimmers who can touch their toes can use it to make as much as a 180-degree direction change. Another effective turn is the one-arm turn, which is a little more conservative and flat. To perform it, extend your inside arm in front of you and position the palm of that hand vertically so that it acts like a rudder. Use your other arm to stroke until you finish the turn. Your inside arm is closer to the buoy, and your stroking arm is farther from it. 198 --- Page 218 Text --- Open-Water and Survival Swimming Follow these steps to practice changing directions.

Survival SWimming Sidestroke, though not a competitive stroke, is a great stroke to master for open-water and survival swimming. It allows you to have your face out of the water to breathe and uses a powerful scissorlike kick. Like breaststroke, it derives propulsion almost equally from armstroking and kicking. As the name implies, sidestroke is done on the side; one shoulder and arm are toward the bottom of the pool, and the other shoulder is out of the water with the majority of the arm submerged. As with the other strokes discussed in this book, the best way to master the sidestroke is to master its individual elements separately and then put them all together. Sidestroke Kicking The sidestroke employs a scissor kick (figure 9.7), which differs from the flutter kick in that the legs are wide apart and the swimmer is on his or her side. To perform the scis- sor kick, bring the leg that is closer to the surface forward by drawing the knee toward your chest. The leg that is closer to the bottom of the pool extends back so

legs are wide apart and the swimmer is on his or her side. To perform the scis- sor kick, bring the leg that is closer to the surface forward by drawing the knee toward your chest. The leg that is closer to the bottom of the pool extends back so that you are almost in a stridelike position on your side. Next, bring your legs together while extending the leg that was drawn to the chest. As you wedge yourself forward, you should feel the pressure on the back of your top leg and on the front of your bottom leg. 203 --- Page 223 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 9.7 SideStrOke kiCk Preparation 1.

After you glide for a second or two, repeat the kick in that b same position. miSStep You keep both legs straight and just move them back and forth. COrreCtiOn Both knees need to bend as you separate into a stridelike position. The force of the movement needs to be backward in order to provide a propulsive forward movement. miSStep You bring your upper leg back and your lower leg forward. COrreCtiOn This will work to a small extent, but you will tend to roll over on your back. Make sure to bring your upper leg forward. 204 --- Page 224 Text --- Open-Water and

As you do so, sneak your bottom arm forward to the starting position. 6. Repeat. c 205 --- Page 225 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success miSStep You keep splashing at the water with your lead hand. COrreCtiOn Remember to slide the hand forward rather than reach over the water. miSStep You push your lead hand down rather than back to lift your head. COrreCtiOn This is a common temptation as a way to get the head higher; remember, however, to lay your head on your lead arm and then sweep back. Complete Sidestroke The process of putting it all together for the sidestroke is very similar to the process for the breaststroke in that your arm and leg movements must be somewhat inde- pendent. The most effective use of the powerful kick is to perform it while you are extended, with your lead arm out, so be patient. While your legs recover to kick again, your momentum should be maintained by the propulsive force of the pull and armstroke. Do the following to practice the complete sidestroke. PreParation 1. Make sure that you have adequate space to do the stroke. 2. Get into the water and lie on your front in the neutral position. execution 1. With the one arm extended, rotate to the side and sweep your other arm down so that it is closer to the top of the water and your face is turned out of the water. 2.

At the same time, sneak your upper arm and hand forward to meet your bottom arm. 5. As your hands touch, turn the hand of your upper arm to put pressure on the water down to your side. 6. As you do so, sneak your bottom arm forward to the starting position. 7. Repeat by beginning again with the kick after returning. miSStep You claw at the water while kicking.

Exhale slowly and glide. Roll your face to air, then pull and kick again. elementary BaCkStrOke Though not a competitive stroke, the elementary backstroke (figure 9.9) is an effec- tive open-water tool and a great stroke for survival swimming because it enables you to propel yourself while expending minimal energy. In addition, your face is always out of the water, which enables you to breathe easily. The stroke is performed by incorporating an arm push and a breaststroke kick while lying on your back. Unlike the breaststroke, this stroke involves nearly simultaneous arm and leg movements. Make sure that your arms stay in the water the whole time. When practicing this stroke in a pool, make sure that the backstroke flags are in place or have a

This motion causes you to “bounce” in the water and likely makes your face sink when you recover your hands. Be sure to push in a sweeping motion toward your thighs. miSStep You kick out with your legs and draw your knees up too high. COrreCtiOn This motion causes water to rush up to your face and provides you with little or no propulsion. Instead, make sure to push your lower legs together with the inside of your calves and your insteps. 208 --- Page 228 Text --- Open-Water and Survival Swimming SWim, FlOat, and SWim again This strategy gives you a simple way to prevent exhaustion if you are intentionally swimming a long distance or become tired in an emergency situation. It consists simply of swimming one of the strokes you have learned in the previous steps, then rolling onto your back and floating in the neutral position to rest. You then roll back over and continue swimming. When fatigue returns, repeat the process. To practice this sequence, swim until you feel tired, then roll over to float (figure 9.10). Once you have recovered, continue swimming. Performing this skill multiple times over several hundred yards will increase your confidence in open water.

Make sure that you are the only one in your lane and that no swimmers are coming in the other direction. Execution a 1.

COrreCtiOn This approach can be somewhat effective but provides less rest because treading is an active water skill. 209 --- Page 229 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success drillS FOr Survival SWimming Survival swimming is much like any other kind of swimming in the sense that it is a specific skillset that when practiced and mastered cannot only add to the enjoyment of swimming but also potentially save your life. The following drills are meant to enhance your ability to perform each skill with as little effort as possible to conserve energy in an emergency situation. Survival Swimming Drill 1 Scissor kick With kickboard While lying on your side in the water, lay the kickboard on the water with one arm extended on the board and your other arm at your side. Practice the scissor kick multiple times with your head on your extended arm and the board. Try this drill on both the right and the left sides; you will probably find one side easier than the other. tO inCreaSe diFFiCulty • Hold the kickboard with just your hand rather than having your whole arm on the board. tO deCreaSe diFFiCulty • Have a friend or coach hold your hips up for the first few tries.

they often involve either distance or time or both. Many recreational swimmers are also seeking to do a first triathlon or perhaps just become able to swim a certain distance or swim for a certain amount of time. These swimmers need to set a goal to get them out of bed for a morning workout or help them be sure to swing by the pool on the way home from work. In other examples, a person might set a goal of obtaining scuba certification or getting fit enough to keep up with active peers. Swimmers in this cat- egory also set goals for becoming more comfortable in the water and more efficient in their movements. If you have found that you excel in a given stroke, then you may wish to think about competing. Competitive goals tend to be tightly focused, and they vary widely from swimmer to swimmer. For example, some swimmers aim to do better in the swim portion of a local triathlon, whereas others want to compete in open-water or pool-based events. The best and most focused goals are based on measurable criteria, such as performing a specific stroke for a specific time and distance. This type of goal is much different from, say, setting a general goal of winning. How to Do It Well Regardless of whether you are a fitness, recreational, or competitive swimmer, your goals should be challenging and motivating. Many people have found that they set more effective goals if they use a system based on the acronym SMART. The S in SMART stands for specific, which means that the goal should include meaningful detail about activity, time, location, and requirements. A vague goal might read like this: “I am going to start swimming more.” In contrast, a more spe- cific goal might
