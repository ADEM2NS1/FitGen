used to. To illustrate this point, compare the actions 31 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 31 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 34 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming performed with the arms in rowing with those used in swimming. They have many similarities and use many of the same muscles. Rowing, in fact, is a land exercise often recommended for swimmers. Both rowers and swimmers initiate the arm movement with their arms extended in front of them. Both pull toward the body. Both use a cycling arm action. However, in rowing, the athlete’s body position is perpendicular to the arms. In swimming, the body is positioned parallel to the arms. This fundamental difference distinguishes the way the muscles exert themselves in swimming from the way they do in rowing and most other land activities. The foot position of swimmers is another good example of the unique way muscles are used in swimming. Without the ground as a foundation, the feet take on a completely different role in the water. The primary human foot position is perpendicular to the leg, creating a base to stand on and spring from. In swimming, this foot position is used only in a limited fashion for the breaststroke kick, and for starts and turns. Instead, the primary foot position for swimmers is pointed, heel to toe. From this position, it is the top of the foot that applies the most resistance rather than the sole of the feet. This seemingly minor difference is central to how the muscles in the entire leg are used. In fact, it is common for people who are not used to swimming to experience cramps in the calf and in the arch of the foot when they swim due to the different requirements of the muscles when resistance is applied with the

common swimming-related health problems. If a swimmer’s shoulder does become painful, rest, as well as targeted strengthening exercises of the shoulder stabilizers, should be part of the recovery process. 44 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 44 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 47 Text --- The Swimming Muscles KEY MUSCLES FOR CERTAIN STROKES We want to think in terms of multi-muscle swimming movements as much as possible, however because the pull pattern, kicking action, leverage and balance requirements in each of the four competitive swimming strokes is unique, we must consider which muscles are especially important to each stroke. BUTTERFLY The wide bilateral recovery of the butterfly places a demand on the trapezius unlike any other stroke. In addition, the initial movements of the power phase are done when the swimmer’s body is lower than the chest, requiring the pectoralis major to engage in a distinct lifting action. Finally, as the dolphin kick places the hips in a higher position relative to the body than in other strokes, the gluteus maximus comes into play. Key Butterfly Muscles 45 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 45 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 48 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming BACKSTROKE To achieve the ideal body position in backstroke, the pelvis must be tilted Key Backstroke Muscles forward through abdominal contraction of the retus abdominus. The upward kick, against gravity also puts a large demand on the quads. The unique catch position, behind the head requires the rhomboids to contract heavily. Finally, the elongated push portion of the arm stroke engages the triceps more completely, and for a longer duration than in other strokes. BREASTSTROKE The unique requirements of the breaststroke kick engage several muscles that are not otherwise used much in swimming. While the hamstrings are used to raise the heels, the hip flexors and abductors perform and stabilize

engages the triceps more completely, and for a longer duration than in other strokes. BREASTSTROKE The unique requirements of the breaststroke kick engage several muscles that are not otherwise used much in swimming. While the hamstrings are used to raise the heels, the hip flexors and abductors perform and stabilize the sweeping motion of the kick. As the foot position goes from completely feet flexed to completely pointed, the calf muscles are also heavily engaged. The abbreviated breaststroke arm stroke employs the biceps more so than the other strokes during the in-sweep of the Key Breaststroke Muscles 46 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 46 12.07.11 12:12 --- OCR from Page 48 Image 2 --- Key Backstroke Muscles --- OCR from Page 48 Image 4 --- Key Breaststroke Muscles --- Page 49 Text --- The Swimming Muscles stroke. Finally, the breaststroke’s underwater recovery employs the upper trapezius to shrug and roll the shoulders forward as the arms return to the extended position. FREESTYLE The three-dimensional sweeping pull pattern of the freestyle taxes the shoulders more than any other stroke. Rotator cuff muscles and muscles of the scapular region work overtime to stabilize the shoulders in freestyle, as the arms rotate from a high elbow position to the rear of the body during recovery to an extended position in front of the body during the power phase. Finally, the obliques serve as primary movers in freestyle to produce the corkscrew effect that sends power from the core to the upper and lower limbs.

Lunges — Standing with hands clasped behind the head and elbows out to the sides, take a giant step forward, lowering the knee of the back leg almost to the ground. Return to the standing position. Do the same with other leg leading. Repeat. Running Lines — With five lines drawn on the ground about 5 yards apart, run to the first line, touch it and return to the starting point, then run to the second line, touch it and return to the starting point, and continue the pattern through all five lines. Variation: Build up 1 to 5 lines, and then build down 5 to 1 lines. (Do you mean starting at the farthest line and doing the longer runs down to the shortest?) 66 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 66 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 69 Text --- Let’s Get Specific Frog Jumps — From a full squat position, explode upward. Repeat a few times. Skipping — Hop forward on one foot and then the other rhythmically and repeatedly.

Not top-level racers striving for national championships or dreaming of Olympic glory. Ordinary swimmers. The ones who fall somewhere between Becky Adlington and people who would only swim if they fell out of a boat. In other words, most of us. IS THIS BOOK FOR YOU? There are lots of good books on swimming out there. To work out if this particular one will help you, ask yourself if you fit into one of these categories: • Are you a keen swimmer who turns up at the pool and regularly swims for half an hour or more, getting fitter and fitter – but never much faster? • Does it feel as though you’re splashing your way up and down the pool, while you notice the really good swimmers smoothly gliding along? • Would you like to be able to do triathlons, but find the swim leg so daunting that it puts you off? • Do you find swimming front crawl so tiring that you can only manage a couple of lengths at a time – even though you can swim breaststroke for ages? • Are you aiming to take part

triathlons, but find the swim leg so daunting that it puts you off? • Do you find swimming front crawl so tiring that you can only manage a couple of lengths at a time – even though you can swim breaststroke for ages? • Are you aiming to take part in a long swim for charity and feeling nervous about completing the distance, or maybe wishing you could swim front crawl instead of breaststroke? If you read one or more of these and felt a flash of recognition, Swim Better, Swim Faster can help. SIX SIMPLE ELEMENTS Swim Better, Swim Faster separates front crawl into six key elements. Work on just one of these for even a few hours, and you should feel an improvement in your stroke: --- Page 7 Text --- 1. Flexibility 2. Body position 3. Arm stroke 4. Breathing 5. Kicking 6. Stroke and rhythm People often feel that they have a particular problem with one of these areas, and concentrate on that. But the trick with swimming is to get all the elements of your stroke working together smoothly and in balance. Work on all six over a period of time, and your swimming will quickly improve. TURNS As well as swimming technique, Swim Better, Swim Faster has advice on turns: • Many pool swimmers would like to learn tumble turns, which are a great way of getting more out of your time in the pool. • Triathletes taking part in cold-weather races often do the swim leg in a pool. In some triathlons swimmers are banned from doing tumble turns – but it’s still possible to make up a lot of time by doing the fastest possible touch turn. Top tip The advice and drills in Swim Better, Swim Faster will make you a

range of movement from the previous drill, opposite: keep your legs straight, your toes pointed, and kick from the hips. Your knees should be stiff, but not rigid. 3. You’ll feel a rocking movement in your hips; try to keep your head still and your upper body still and relaxed. Breathe out steadily as soon as your face is underwater, which will help you to relax. 4. If you’re not using a swimming snorkel, lift your head to breathe when necessary, but keep kicking. Notice how lifting your head affects the angle of your hips and legs, and forces you to start bending your knees as you kick. If you feel your leg kick getting clunky and big during a swim, a few lengths of this drill will remind your body of what it should be doing. --- Page 113 Text --- Kicking: building power Many swimmers fail to get what they need from their leg kick because they only kick down, with the top of their foot and their shin. This drill encourages you to develop the other stroke of your leg kick: the upstroke, using the bottom of your foot and your calf. What you need • A small area of pool where you’re out of your depth There are three versions of this drill, each one increasingly difficult. When you can manage the third, hardest version it will be a good sign that your kick is really effective. Version 1 – least tough Float vertically in water that’s well out of your depth. Cross your arms over your chest, palms flat. Kick hard to keep your head above water, using the flutter kick described at the start of this chapter. Take care not to start using an eggbeater kick, a kind of alternate breaststroke kick used by

that’s well out of your depth. Cross your arms over your chest, palms flat. Kick hard to keep your head above water, using the flutter kick described at the start of this chapter. Take care not to start using an eggbeater kick, a kind of alternate breaststroke kick used by water polo players to lift their torsos out of the water. Ideally, try to maintain the exercise for at least 30 seconds before stopping for a 15-second rest, then repeating it. Doing this a total of five or six times each session should be enough. --- Page 114 Text --- Version 1 – least tough. Version 2 – harder In this version of the drill, instead of crossing your arms over your chest you lift your hands free of the water. Just keep your hands and forearms in the air, with your elbows below the surface. Version 2 – harder. --- Page 115 Text --- Version 3 – very testing This time, instead of putting only your hands in the air, lift up both arms into the streamlined position. You’ll have to kick very hard even to get your head above water for a breath. Only try this version when you’re comfortably able to complete five or six repetitions of the second iteration of this drill. Otherwise you risk swallowing a magnum of pool water and putting yourself off swimming forever. Version 3 – very testing. Kicking: building strength (part 1) This is a land-based training technique you can do anywhere. It builds leg strength, improves technique and strengthens your core. What you need: • A comfortable place to lie down • Ideally a fellow swimmer --- Page 116 Text --- 1. Lie on your back, with your hands tucked under your bottom, lifting your hips slightly. 2.

without losing speed, can gain you several metres. Of course, that means the area close to the turn buoy becomes a pinch point: if you’re not competing, and want only to enjoy your swim, you may think it’s a better idea to give the buoy a wider berth. Rounding a buoy This is a good exercise for competitive open-water swimmers. It gets you corkscrewing round a turn buoy very quickly. You will need • Ideally, an anchored buoy 1. Swim at the buoy, sighting a couple of times as you get close to it. --- Page 171 Text --- 2. Aim to swim very slightly past the buoy, taking a stroke with the arm closest to the buoy (your left) as you come past. 3. Instead of taking another front crawl stroke, continue the roll of your body so that you turn on to your back. As you do this, twist slightly toward the buoy. 4. Take a stroke of backstroke with your other arm. Use this to continue to roll in the same direction, taking you back on to your front. With practice, this will get you round a 90° turn very fast, without the need to lift your head, do a little bit of breaststroke, etc. --- Page 172 Text --- SWIM STRATEGY FOR TRIATHLON If you are swimming open water as part of a triathlon, it’s worth thinking about how your swim will fit with your overall performance. Bear in mind that triathlons are never won on the swim leg. To get a good overall performance you’ll need to balance two key elements: finishing position versus energy expended. Unless you’re a very strong swimmer, pushing yourself to keep up with a fast group will leave you too tired for the bike and run legs. In general, it’s

QUALITY Whenever you’re doing any of the exercises or drills in this book (or any others that you’ve developed for yourself), try to make an active decision not to go fast. There’s an old saying that applies here: ‘First, do it. Then, do it right. Last, do it fast.’ Technique work falls into the second category: do it right. If you try to add speed, it will detract from your ability to control your movements with precision. Top tip --- Page 177 Text --- For most people, it’s worthwhile getting an experienced coach to provide an analysis of your style, and give you key areas for improvement. Try to limit these to three key elements, for example: 1 KEEP YOUR HEAD ANGLE LOWER, BY LOOKING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL RATHER THAN AHEAD 2 PLACE YOUR HAND IN THE WATER IN FRONT OF YOUR SHOULDER 3 STOP BENDING YOUR KNEES WHEN YOU KICK Think about the three key improvements whenever you swim, rather than only when you are specifically working on your technique. Session 1 Duration • 20–30 minutes This session focuses on improving the side-to-side roll of your body as you take each stroke. Concentrate on smooth transitions from one side to the other. Warm up Swim 400m, broken down into: • 50m front crawl • 50m butterfly drill • 50m front crawl • 50m backstroke, concentrating on rolling your body with each arm stroke • 50m front crawl • 50m breaststroke • 100m front crawl Set 1 • 4 × 50m, with a 15-second gap between each 50m Do the kick–breathe drill.

Tread water in the deep end, then take a deep breath and allow yourself to float vertical in the water. Immediately begin to breathe out in a controlled, steady way. Keep breathing out until you start to sink (it may take longer than you expect). You’re aiming to sink to the bottom and sit there cross-legged. • 8 × 25m, 15-second gap between each 25m Follow the flutter-kick drill. Each time you take a breath and your face goes back in the water, begin to breathe out steadily as in the sinking practice above. Only lift your head when you need to take a breath. --- Page 180 Text --- (Notice how lifting your head to breathe affects the angle and action of your leg kick: your legs sink lower, and you start to bend your knees more, both of which cause drag.) Set 2 • 8 × 25m Move to full-stroke three-quarter catch-up (or full catch-up if you prefer). As above, breathe out constantly and steadily; rather than taking a breath every two or three strokes, breathe only when you need to.

Warm up Swim 400m, broken down into: • 100m front crawl • 200m alternating front crawl and backstroke every 25m • 100m front crawl Set 1 • 8 × 25m, 15-second gap between each 25m Follow the flutter-kick drill. Whether or not you have a swimming snorkel on, remember to keep breathing out a steady stream of air. This stops your upper body from being too buoyant, and helps you to relax your torso and keep it still. Your movement should be from the hips, with stiff knees and loose --- Page 181 Text --- ankles. Set 2 • 4 × (3 × 25m), 20-second gap between each 75m This set is in parcels of three lengths. Swim the first length following the flutter-kick drill but without a swimming snorkel. Hold a pull buoy on top of your kickboard (this is just to get it down to the other end of the pool, so you only have to do it on this first length of the set). For the second length, put your float on the side of the pool and put the pull buoy between your legs, then swim back arms-only (some people like to put the buoy between their calves, rather than their thighs). For the final length, put the pull buoy on the side of the pool and swim full stroke. As you swim the third

All these DVDs are available in our store at www.swimsmooth.com/products --- Page 25 Text --- CHAPTER 2 Introduction to Freestyle Swimming The Freestyle swim stroke, often called Front Crawl in many parts of the world, is the fastest of the four competitive strokes and also the one best suited to long distance events. In the elite swimming world it is the only stroke that is raced for distances of 400 m and longer. Freestyle is unique in that the swimmer has their face in the water for most of the stroke before rotating to the side to breathe very low to the surface. Breathing is a significant challenge when learning freestyle and the struggle to get enough air, without taking on water, is a dominant feature of many beginners’ experiences. Freestyle is the fastest of the four competition strokes. The body rotates along the long axis of the spine during the stroke, which helps the swimmer engage their chest, back and core muscles effectively on every stroke. The lack of vertical movement in comparison to butterfly or breaststroke allows good swimmers to sit very high in the water minimising their drag profile. In comparison to backstroke, freestyle has biomechanical advantages, allowing a better propulsive technique in the water. For triathlon and open water swimming, freestyle is a

The lack of vertical movement in comparison to butterfly or breaststroke allows good swimmers to sit very high in the water minimising their drag profile. In comparison to backstroke, freestyle has biomechanical advantages, allowing a better propulsive technique in the water. For triathlon and open water swimming, freestyle is a much more compact and ‘narrow’ stroke than butterfly and breaststroke making it ideal for swimming in close confines to other swimmers and obviously has significant sighting advantages for holding a straight line between points over swimming on your back in backstroke. --- Page 26 Text --- ADAM: If you can swim breaststroke comfortably but are new to freestyle you’ll find it a revelation when you get the hang of it. With practice you will be able to feel a real sense of rhythm in the stroke without the stop-go action of breaststroke. It’s a bit like breaking out into a run after walking. As we will see in this book, the exact freestyle technique used by great swimmers varies depending on the race distance, the race environment (e.g. pool vs. open water) and to some extent personal preference. However, the key elements of a great stroke are common between all these great swimmers. Swimming Terminology As coaches and swimmers we have names for each area of the stroke and conventions we use for elements like your swimming speed and the length of your stroke as you swim. Don’t be put off by this, this ‘jargon’ is pretty simple and makes a lot of sense when you get the hang of it. The good news is that, for the large part, the terminology used in this book is common all over the world which means you should be able to understand most things written on the internet about swimming and coaching

the thinking behind the system and how it was created: --- Page 143 Text --- PAUL: Coming from a competitive swimming background as a kid growing up in the UK, I always found it fascinating to see how different body types and builds gravitated towards each of the four competitive strokes – butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke and freestyle. The tallest swimmers with great hip flexibility tended to excel at breaststroke; the tall, muscular swimmers with great kicks were strong in the freestyle and backstroke sprint events; and the shorter, stockier swimmers with good upper-body flexibility tended to be good at butterfly. Being a little vertically challenged myself (compared to some of my giant-like rivals!) my best events were the 100 m and 200 m butterfly and the longer distance freestyle events. I could not seem to sprint like the other guys no matter how much speed work I put in but ask me to move along at a moderately fast pace and maintain this for repetition after repetition, well that I could do! Still, there were no prizes for being good at training or having a good work ethic – all that counted was who was first to the touch pads. Proudly representing Bridlington Swimming Club aged 9 (centre) I couldn’t change my growth rate or the size of my feet but swimming would have been a lot less frustrating had I been shown how genetics potentially predisposed me to one stroke or distance of event over another. I certainly wouldn’t have kept trying to become a super-quick 50 m freestyle specialist against my 1.9 m / 6′ 4″ rivals! What’s more, the recommended stroke style and technique that worked for these guys just didn’t seem to work for me. As a junior I was told by my coaches that my

The Smooth Swim Type is what everybody thinks of when they imagine a long efficient stroke style. They are the envy of the pool with their relaxed style moving them seemingly effortlessly through the water accompanied by a 6-beat kick. They are strong technically in all areas with great turns and starts, and they are normally competitive at backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly as well as freestyle. Most elite pool swimmers are Smooths, with all time greats such as Ian Thorpe and Alexander Popov typifying this category. Although many observers believe this style of stroke is very efficient and therefore well suited to distance swimming, in practice the opposite is true, most elite Smooths excel as sprinters and middle distance (200 m / 400 m) freestylers. Nearly all Smooths have a significant childhood swimming background, very few adults have been able to develop their strokes to this level without such a background, although it is possible. Smooths are talented athletes with excellent technical skills, coordination and awareness of their body movements in the water. When making modifications to their stroke Smooths are able to do so quickly and easily once they understand what they need to do. The Smooth stroke style is certainly efficient but that does not make it ‘effortless’ as many other swimmers might believe. A Smooth will tell you how hard they are actually working when they swim, it’s their huge control and technical ability that makes the stroke appear effortless from the outside. Think of their movements as being like those of an Olympic gymnast or ballet dancer — they have tremendous grace and poise but to do so they are using strength and control. --- Page 177 Text --- Olympian Jono Van Hazel shows us his classical high elbow recovery.

reaching either side of the feet as you fold yourself over at the waist; 2) the competition start — feet about shoulder width apart and hands reaching between the feet, using the lip of the block to pull up against and gain traction on the block and coil the body like a tight spring; 3) the track start (shown) — a similar hand position as the classic start, but one foot is placed back in a similar stance to how a track runner might start — this will typically be your strongest leg. Experiment and see which gives you the fastest reaction time and power off the blocks. 3. The starter will start you off with the instruction ‘take your marks. . .’ and then follow with either a whistle, gun blast or a simple ‘go!’ 4. Keep your chin tucked into your chest and spring your arms out in front of you to form a streamlined torpedo whilst driving off the block with the legs aiming for both a little height and a good bit of distance. If you lift your head and look forward too much you will cause your legs to drop too low and you will hit the water stomach and chest first (the ‘belly flop’). Tucking your chin in too tightly and spearing the water at too great an angle will force you into a nose dive and send you too deep into the water. 5. Once in the water, keep your hands together and commence a powerful kick to maintain your speed before breaking out into your full stroke just as per any normal push-off.

commence a powerful kick to maintain your speed before breaking out into your full stroke just as per any normal push-off. In our Swim Smooth Perth squad sessions we perform very little of the other three competitive strokes: butterfly, backstroke and breaststroke. Whilst these strokes can benefit your freestyle by developing better muscular balance across the body, if you are only swimming two or three times per week and training for a triathlon or open water swimming event, we would advise you to keep your training as specific as possible and focus on mastering the freestyle stroke. However, it is still useful to know some tips on performing the other three strokes and using them in your warm-ups, and particularly cool-downs, as a good way to vary your programme. Butterfly — often seen as the hardest competitive stroke, butterfly can be challenging because it requires excellent rhythm and timing, good flexibility and a strong leg kick. The stroke undulates around the short axis of the spine and in this respect is more similar to breaststroke than freestyle and backstroke. The best way of visualising a good butterfly stroke is to think of yourself moving through the water like a dolphin. Both arms work together above and below the water with a more rounded recovery than in freestyle — probably one of the reasons why many Swingers are good at butterfly! You do need to be cautious, however, as the lack of long axis rotation in butterfly can increase the load on your shoulders so you should limit the volume of butterfly in your programme. Performing butterfly with fins is a great way to develop a feel for the undulated action of the stroke, it can also tone up your midsection and when done gently can help to --- Page 242

on your shoulders so you should limit the volume of butterfly in your programme. Performing butterfly with fins is a great way to develop a feel for the undulated action of the stroke, it can also tone up your midsection and when done gently can help to --- Page 242 Text --- loosen off a tight lower back. The key to a good butterfly stroke is to ensure that as your head comes up out of the water to take a breath, you do this quickly and focus on getting your chin down onto your chest as quickly as you can. This will help the torso dive back down into the water and assist the arms with their recovery over the top of the surface. The key to butterfly is to breathe and then quickly drop your chin back down onto your chest. Backstroke — very similar to freestyle with respect to long axis rotation, backstroke is effectively the reverse of freestyle and is often used as a way of stretching out during a cool-down and working the muscles in the opposite direction. To be good at backstroke having a strong leg kick is essential. If you don’t have a strong kick and want to try some of the beneficial aspects of the stroke then try wearing a pair of fins. Another important feature of backstroke is to keep your head back. We often tell the children who we work with to imagine that they have to keep their noses in the air like a ‘posh’ person would walk around. This stops the common mistake of bringing the chin towards the chest, which causes the swimmer to sit up in the water and drop the legs and buttocks down low. Breaststroke — whilst used by many swimmers who cannot swim

in the air like a ‘posh’ person would walk around. This stops the common mistake of bringing the chin towards the chest, which causes the swimmer to sit up in the water and drop the legs and buttocks down low. Breaststroke — whilst used by many swimmers who cannot swim freestyle, breaststroke is actually the least economic and slowest stroke due to the width of the body cutting through the water during the wide ‘frog’ kick. The reason breaststroke is favoured by many swimmers is because of the ease of lifting the head out of the water to breathe. Coordinating breathing in the freestyle stroke can initially be quite daunting whereas breaststroke is significantly easier and for this reason is a very valid way of becoming accustomed to the water when starting out in swimming. One of the keys to a great backstroke is to make sure your head is pushed back into the water. --- Page 243 Text --- Good breaststrokers often have very good hip flexibility, which helps with the angles required to gain a propulsive kick. The key to a good breaststroke is good coordination between the arms and legs and to aim to reduce the frontal profile by not pulling or kicking too wide. A simple focal point for developing a better breaststroke is to focus on snapping your elbows into your sides as you pull through and then driving your arms forwards in as sleek a motion as you possibly can. Try visualising scooping out a bowl of cake mix with your hands as they pull through to develop this motion! A fast breaststroke uses a snappy arm movement, returning to the front of the stroke as soon as possible.

a bowl of cake mix with your hands as they pull through to develop this motion! A fast breaststroke uses a snappy arm movement, returning to the front of the stroke as soon as possible. Individual Medley — Swimmers can bring all four competitive strokes together and perform an Individual Medley (‘IM’) which consists of 25 m, 50 m or 100 m of each stroke in succession without stopping in the following order: butterfly, backstroke, breaststroke, freestyle. If performed as part of a medley relay team with three other --- Page 244 Text --- swimmers, the order of the strokes is slightly different: backstroke, breaststroke, butterfly, freestyle. For more experienced swimmers, completing a 400 m IM always proves to be a good challenge and is worth swimming every now and then to spice up your training regime. The Most Important Walk in Swimming It might be as little as 10 metres but the walk from the changing rooms to the pool can really define your swimming. If you’ve been learning freestyle or working on improving your stroke then you should feel proud of yourself. Most people in the world cannot swim and many in the Western world do absolutely no exercise at all. You may not be the fastest swimmer in the world but that is absolutely fine thank you — so start walking out onto the pool deck tall and proud. Like your mum used to say: ‘head up, shoulders back, chest forwards!’ A final tip: guys, don’t forget to shave that 5 o’clock shadow before you swim! Adopting some positive body language and being confident in what you are doing will make a real difference when you start swimming. For one thing it will improve the positivity and rhythm in your stroke, which can only be good for

a turn buoy in a triathlon or open water swim can be very intimidating to those new to open water swimming. Many worry about getting caught up on the fixing rope or being pushed --- Page 268 Text --- under water by their competitors (a very rare occurrence). These fears are mostly groundless but there is little wonder many swimmers give turn buoys a very wide birth adding considerable distance to their swims. You might also feel the need to switch to head-up breaststroke round the buoy in an effort not to get swamped. This will ruin the rhythm and flow of your swim though and can result in other competitors swimming into the back of you. By working on improving your turning technique you can swim through these areas of the course in a much more effective (and impressive!) manner: 1. Get Ahead. If you have been swimming side by side with a couple of other swimmers, it will serve you well to make sure that you are the first around the buoy. Put in a short burst of speed about 25 m before the turn to get there first. 2. Corkscrew Roll. As you approach the buoy, keep in close and aim to slide the hand closest past the buoy and roll over onto your back and then continuing the roll immediately back onto your front. Add in a little twist as you do so and this should give you a neat 90° turn without breaking your stroke rhythm. If you wish to turn left, it’s your left hand that should slide past the buoy to start the process and for a right turn, your right hand should slide past. For very tight turns try combining two consecutive rolls to bring you around the buoy quickly and efficiently.

buoys, and snorkels. Kickboards The kickboard (figure 2) is a fairly common piece of equipment found in many swim- mers’ training bags. It is typically made of some sort of foam to provide flotation. Its purpose is to provide a buoyancy assist so that swimmers can isolate and train the kicking motion. It is often used to train all four competitive strokes. Figure 2 Two different styles of kickboards. xv --- Page 17 Text --- The Sport of Swimming Fins Fins are commonly used in swim training to add resistance to the kicking motion, helping the person to swim more easily or to make the workout harder. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes (figure 3), and some are designed specifically for a cer- tain competitive stroke—for example, the monofin and the breaststroke fin. Monof- ins are a training tool specific to dolphin kick. Breastroke fins are also very specific to that kick and, due to the increase in pressure on the groin area and the inside of the knee, should probably be used only under the supervision of a knowledgeable coach and with a swimmer who has had sufficient technique training and the strength to benefit from the extra resistance. For training purposes, fins with medium-size blades work for most swimmers, though it is a good idea to use shorter blades in the beginning in order to prevent injury. People who have less strength or flexibility in the lower extremities—especially the ankles—should definitely use a medium or shorter blade of 6 to 9 inches (about 15 to 23 centimeters) to prevent overstressing those joints with the added pressure and resistance created by longer blades (often seen in scuba shops). In addition, short-blade fins (shorter than 6 inches, or 15 cen- timeters) are often used to work with

Some of the drills do not resemble swimming, but they show you how manipulating your body position and putting pressure on the water in different ways can help you achieve your goal of success in swimming! 20 --- Page 40 Text --- Step 2 Manipulating the Water The goal of this second step is to increase your awareness of drag force, propul- sive force, and how specific movements create propulsion and minimize drag. In other words, this step helps you understand how to use your body’s surfaces to apply pressure on the water in order to move through it. By the end of this step, you should be able to • achieve an aquatic position that minimizes drag; • get a feel for the water and where it slips off of your hands when anchoring your hands during the crucial catch phase of a stroke; • use a sculling motion for propulsion; and • use flutter, dolphin, and breaststroke kicks for propulsion, both on your back and on your front.

catch phase of a stroke; • use a sculling motion for propulsion; and • use flutter, dolphin, and breaststroke kicks for propulsion, both on your back and on your front. Drag Force anD ProPulsive Force Drag force slows you down, whereas propulsive force makes you move. Drag force is easy to understand if you think in terms of skydiving. While falling, skydivers accel- erate due to gravity. They accelerate more if they make themselves skinny and verti- cal (i.e., streamlined), thereby minimizing their cross-sectional area (the area facing in their direction of travel) and in turn minimizing the resistance or drag force that acts on them. On the other hand, if they spread their arms and legs out and become more horizontal, they maximize the area that is perpendicular to their direction of fall and thus slow down due to air resistance. At some point, our daredevils deploy their parachutes, greatly increasing their cross-sectional area, in order to slow down even more and avoid plummeting to their doom. What does this have to do with swimming? Aerodynamics and hydrodynamics have a lot in common! The big difference lies in the fact that water is about 750 times denser than air and therefore involves much higher drag force. This strong resistance is the reason that high divers can slow down so quickly upon entering the water even at very high speeds. Of course, it also slows down swimmers. At the same time, however, water gives swimmers a denser surface upon which to apply pressure than air does. Swimmers can take advantage of this density by using 21 --- Page 41 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success propulsive force to their advantage. Specifically, they apply pressure to the water in a direction that is perpendicular to the direction in which they want

space to perform the skill. 2. You can use a kickboard or pull buoy for the skill. Execution 1. Place the kickboard under your chest for buoyancy and lay on the water facedown. 2. Once you have achieved a balanced a position on the kickboard reach your arms forward above your head. 3. With the palms facing down, begin by pitching the fingers of the left hand down to make the palm of the hand perpendicular to the top of the water. 4. Pull the hand back toward the hip and thigh keeping, the hand perpen- dicular the whole way. 5. Return to the start position. 6. Try the same motion with the oppo- site arm. 7. For the breaststroke catch, begin in the start position with arms stretched b out above the head and lying flat on the water with the kickboard still under your chest. 8.

It is best to do it in a streamlined position if you can. The purpose of this drill is to help you develop the ability to put pressure on the water in an up-and-down fashion. To increase DiFFiculTy • Kick underwater in a streamlined position. Propulsive force can be gen- erated with an asymmetrical kick; however, maximum propulsion comes from kicking in both directions. This capability comes into play in both the butterfly and the backstroke. To Decrease DiFFiculTy • Use fins to prevent that stalling feeling and avoid rushing the drill. • Rest your upper arms across the kickboard by gripping the top to keep your face out of the water. Be aware that doing so may put extra stress on your lower back. • Use a swimmer’s snorkel. Success Check 2 points: The kickboard is extended, but you need fins. • You can maintain a long body line and perform the drill. 3 points: You can do very well with the kickboard extended and no fins. • You are not breaking the surface or too deep after the first pullout. 4 points: You can go without the board but need fins.

Draw your heels up to your hips while keeping your knees close together, then point your toes out and apply pressure to the water with your insteps and the inside calf of each leg. The kick is per- formed simultaneously with both legs. The following progression helps you ensure that you are doing it correctly to provide maximum propulsion. 44 --- Page 64 Text --- Manipulating the Water Figure 2.10 BreasTsTroKe KicK WiTh one leg Preparation 1. Begin by standing near the pool wall in water that is at least chest deep. Be sure that your chest is touching the wall. 2. Starting with your right leg, draw your heel up with your knee still touching the wall in the dorsiflexed or L position. Once your thigh is parallel to a the bottom of the pool, stop raising the leg. Execution 1. While in this position, slide your heel out and away from the centerline of your body while keeping your knee in the same place. This action may seem awkward at first. The key is to make sure that your heel is farther from the center of your body than your knee is. You may need to use the wall for balance. 2.

Once you have succeeded with your right foot, try the same motion with your left foot. c 45 --- Page 65 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Breaststroke Kick With Both Legs If you can feel pressure in the critical areas when breaststroke-kicking with each leg, then you are ready to try both legs together (figure 2.11). Some swimmers have prob- lems with flexibility in the hips, knees, and ankles and are not as effective as others, so do not let this frustrate you. For most people, this action requires several repeti- tions to master. Figure 2.11 BreasTsTroKe KicK WiTh BoTh legs Preparation 1. Find deeper water and anchor your arms with your hands or elbows to the gutter a or deck so that your legs hang free. Execution 1. Using the same motion described for breaststroke kick with one leg, draw up b both heels. Next, push both heels out while keeping your knees close together, then sweep your feet together in a circular motion. 2. Your heels should be wider apart than your knees; ide- ally, your knees should be no more than hip-width apart when your heels are outside of your knees. c 3.

The next part of the progression involves lying on your back in the neutral position described in step 1 with your hands at your sides for balance. Once you have achieved equilibrium, draw your heels up while trying to keep your upper legs underwater. This is slightly different from being on the wall but involves the same type of movement. Once your heels are close to your hips, rotate your heels out so that they are wider than your knees, then sweep them together. As before, this motion is more about pressure on the water than about the speed of the movement. Squeeze your ankles together. Did you move? The pressure on the water should have caused you to move headfirst. Once you have completed one kick, return to the neutral position and let your momentum fade. Repeat the same motion until you are comfortable with it. Figure 2.12 BreasTsTroKe KicK WiTh ProPulsion Preparation 1. Perform the wall exercise for the breaststroke kick with both legs first. 2.

Breaststroke Kick Drill Kickboard The next part of the progression is to transfer this skill to the front. Using a kickboard, repeat the same motions that you performed on your back. The key is to make your movements slow and correct. Once you feel comfortable on your front with the kickboard, put the board away and try the skill in the streamlined position. When you need to breathe, use the same sculling motion described earlier; remember to breathe out slowly.

He carried the stroke back to England, where it took on his name despite being characterized as un-European barbaric thrashing. Around the turn of the century in Australia, a similar stroke was used with a flutter kick by a Solomon Islander named Alick Wickham.

mimicking the motions of a frog, though the modern version differs somewhat in terms of the kick. In any case, it can be traced back at least to the Stone Age, when cave paintings were made in what is now western Egypt to depict people using the stroke. The breaststroke was also the only stroke used for the first recorded crossing of the Eng- lish Channel by a swimmer. There are several advantages: It is possible to breathe after every stroke, see where you are going, and use the stroke for survival and safety once you know how to do this stroke effectively. Though it is technically the slowest of the four competi- tive strokes, its subtleties and nuances make it arguably the most complex as well. Though everyone can learn to do the breaststroke—and should, since a slower vari- ant of it is essential in swimming long distances when necessary—learning to swim it fast takes a great deal of patience and time. Breaststroke and butterfly are considered “short-axis” strokes but are really tim- ing-and-rhythm strokes. Granted, you do rotate on a shorter axis (i.e., through the chest, laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes: • Good body position • Effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Kicking rhythm • Effective breathing • Effective timing Once you have mastered all of these components, you are well on your way to an effective breaststroke. The breaststroke is the only one of the four competitive strokes that derives its propulsive force equally from the pull and the kick; therefore, you should give equal attention to both elements.

are well on your way to an effective breaststroke. The breaststroke is the only one of the four competitive strokes that derives its propulsive force equally from the pull and the kick; therefore, you should give equal attention to both elements. This double focus is one factor that makes the breast- stroke so elusive for some swimmers. At any level, if you look across the race pool, you will find a greater variety of styles being used for the breaststroke than for any other competitive stroke. Some swimmers use a wider pull or kick, whereas others use a quicker stroke rate and still others a longer rate. Bottom line: there is no agreed- upon best way to do this stroke. 99 --- Page 119 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success As with the other strokes, however, there are certain basic movements that pro- vide propulsive force and minimize drag. More specifically, though it is true that you can have a weaker kick in the freestyle or backstroke and still muscle your way through; the same cannot be said of the breaststroke. Therefore, the first element to focus on in the breaststroke is a good kick. BreasTsTroke kick The following skills and drills will help you master what is the most complex of strokes: the breaststroke. The first of these skills is mastering the breaststroke kick (figure 5.1). Figure 5.1 BreasTsTroke kick Preparation 1. Make sure the area is clear and you have ample space to perform the skill. 2.

Point the feet and toes in opposite directions away from the midline of the body. 3. Push the heels out while keeping the knees tucked in. 4. Sweep the heels together while pushing against the water with the insides of the b calves and the instep of the foot. 5. Hold the position, glide, and then repeat. c 100 --- Page 120 Text --- Breaststroke MissTep You draw the knees outside before the heels. correcTion Leading with the knees causes you to wedge the water with the whole leg and places an increased stress on the hips. Instead, think of the knees as being separated by the width of just your hands. Alternately, placing a small buoy higher above the knees when kick- ing during the breaststroke will accomplish the same thing. Many swimmers experience the following problems in kicking with the breaststroke. To avoid these common mistakes, review the drills from step 2. • Kicking “out” as if doing a side kick rather than anchoring the instep and pushing • Bringing the heels up either too far or not far enough • Kicking with the toes pointed • Drawing out with the knees rather than keeping them in • Keeping the legs together • Not controlling the core and thus making the finish more of a dolphin kick Keep these pitfalls in mind in order to avoid later problems that can result from the lack of an effective propulsive kick.

Drills for kickinG As mentioned in step 2 (manipulating the water), a good propulsive breaststroke kick is all about putting pressure on the water with the legs from the knee down. For a refresher, practice the following drills. Kicking Drill 1 Wall kick Begin by standing near the pool wall in water that is at least chest deep with your back touching the wall. Starting with your right leg, draw the heel up with the knee still touching the wall in the dorsiflexed or L position. Once your thigh is parallel to the bottom of the pool, stop raising the leg. While in this position, slide your heel out and away from the centerline of your body while keeping your knee in the same place. This action may seem awkward at first. The key is to make sure that your heel is farther from the center of your body than your knee is. You may need to use the wall for balance. Once your foot is in position, push the instep in a sweeping motion down toward the bottom of the pool. You have succeeded when you can feel pressure from the water on your instep and on the inside of your calf. Once you have succeeded with your right foot, try this same motion with your left foot. Once you are comfortable with this motion, try both together.

your sides for balance. Draw your heels up. Once your heels are close to your hips, rotate your heels out wider than your knees and then sweep your heels together. Your lower legs and feet should be dorsiflexed or in an L position. Squeeze your ankles together and point your toes while finishing the kick. Remember that these motions are more about pressure than about speed or strength. Once you complete one kick, return to the neutral position and let your momentum fade. Repeat the same motion until you are comfortable with it. Important note! You will not be able to see where you are going during this drill. Make sure that the backstroke flags in place—five yards from the wall—or have your coach or instructor stop you when necessary! 102 --- Page 122 Text --- Breaststroke TToo iinnccrreeaassee DDiiffffiiccuullTTyy •• PPllaaccee aa kkiicckkbbooaarrdd aaccrroossss tthhee uuppppeerr ppaarrtt ooff yyoouurr lleeggss ttoo pprreevveenntt yyoouurr uuppppeerr lleeggss ffrroomm ccoommiinngg oouutt ooff tthhee wwaatteerr.. •• PPllaaccee aa ppuullll bbuuooyy bbeettwweeeenn yyoouurr lleeggss,, sslliigghhttllyy aabboovvee yyoouurr mmiidd--tthhiigghhss,, ttoo eennssuurree tthhaatt yyoouurr kknneeeess ssttaayy ttooggeetthheerr..

The pull The second propulsive element of the breaststroke is the pull (figure 5.2). Unlike free- style and backstroke, each of these movements is independent of the other; therefore, timing is crucial. First, focus on developing a really good breaststroke catch-and-pull phase. The difference is that the hands are not stacked one on top of the other as in the preceding skill. The catch and the pull are two parts of the same motion. The release from the pull position is achieved by bringing the elbows together under the body while simultaneously moving the hands forward. Here is an effective trick for thinking about these movements together. Imagine that you are scraping cake batter out of a bowl with your pinkie fingers, then pushing it to someone else. Your hands accelerate throughout the catch-and-pull phase until reaching the neutral position again. Your hands should never go past your shoulders. If they do, you will have to bring them forward, making a propulsive movement in a direction opposite of the way you are swimming. You will then have to start again after this motion makes you stop, thus requiring more energy to accelerate. Figure 5.2 BreasTsTroke pull Preparation 1.

pull in the breaststroke is just as important as the kick—and more important for some swimmers who are not as good at the kick portion. To develop an effective pull, it is helpful to isolate this part of the overall stroke. More specifically, the pitch of your hand and your elbow positioning are just as important here as they are in the other strokes. The elbows-up position allows you to pull with more than just your hand. Use the following drills to develop a pull with good propulsive force. Pull Drill 1 Breaststroke pull With freestyle kick This drill isolates the pull by using an easier kick and alleviating timing concerns. To perform the drill, lie on your front and kick freestyle with your hands out front. For every six kicks, perform one breaststroke pull. To increase DifficulTy • Kick faster—eight times or more per stroke. To Decrease DifficulTy • Use fins to prevent stalling. • Use a pull buoy and do not kick at all. 106 --- Page 126 Text --- Breaststroke Success Check Score Your Success • You can feel the water on both 1 point: You can go 10 yards. your hands and your forearms. 3 points: You can go 25 yards. • You can go 25 yards on your 5 points: You can go 25 yards in 10 or front in nine pulls with ease. more pulls. 7 points: You can go 25 yards in nine or fewer pulls.

BreaThinG One of the many advantages of the breaststroke is that you can breathe on every stroke. The exact timing of this breath is an important part of the rhythm of the breast- stroke (figure 5.3). As a result, before you start to put it all together for a complete breaststroke, it is a good idea to practice your breathing in isolation. While perform- ing the following drills, lift your head to breathe; the key is to do so at the right time and in the right manner. With the other pressures of laminar flow of water against the chest providing lift on the water, this movement should be sufficient to get your mouth and nose out of the water. Some swimmers will be higher and others lower; it is very specific to each swimmer. 107 --- Page 127 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 5.3 BreasTsTroke BreaThinG Preparation 1. Lie on

The following drills will help you establish a good head position and help with breathing. Breathing Drill Tennis Ball 2 This drill helps you maintain proper head position while going to get air or breathing in breaststroke. To perform the drill, place a tennis ball beneath your chin and hold it to your chest. This action keeps your neck in line and prevents you from coming up too high when you breathe. Swim the regular breaststroke and try breathing both earlier in the stroke and later in the stroke to find out which works best for you. Avoid pushing down on the water with your palms.

the breaststroke. To work on your timing, you can use a few simple drills that empha- size it. The secret to the breaststroke hinges on the fact that half of its propulsive force comes from the kick and the other half from the pull. The key is not to do both at the same time. The proper rhythm is one kick, one pull and breath, and a return to the stretched-out position. 109 --- Page 129 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Drills for TiMinG anD rhyThM Because propulsion in the breaststroke derives equally from the kick and the pull, it is crucial to maximize the efficiency of each element. Get it wrong and you end up being very slow. The key is to make sure that you do not kick when pulling and vice versa. The following drills include some overcorrections of typical problems but should help you separate the two movements so that you can develop a good rhythm. Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 1 Two-hippopotamus Breaststroke This is a slow drill that helps you with your timing. It is performed by pushing off of the wall in the streamlined position. Do one breaststroke kick, then wait while count- ing “one hippopotamus . . . two hippopotamus.” Next, pull and breathe as described earlier and shoot forward before kicking again. This approach teaches the indepen- dent movements of the arms and legs. To increase DifficulTy • Count to “three hippopotamus.” To Decrease DifficulTy • Use a pull buoy far above your knees and kick.

Timing-and-Rhythm Drill 2 Two kicks per stroke This classic breaststroke drill increases your awareness of timing and body posi- tion; it also helps you with balance. It is performed by simply kicking twice in the stretched-out position with your hands far forward (but not on top of each other) and kicking twice per catch–pull sequence. Keep your head down with a long neck during each pair of kicks.

BreasTsTroKe PullouT The modern breaststroke is done with what is referred to as a pullout (figure 5.4), both at the start and during each turn at the wall. To perform the pullout, the swim- mer pushes off the wall underwater (or starts from a dive) in a streamlined position. As the hands separate, they can pull all the way down to the hips just once. The swimmer is allowed to perform one dolphin kick at any time in this part. As the swimmer slows, the hands are brought up the body and close to the body to get into a breast stroke swimming position with the hands out in front. It is at this point that the stroke as described earlier actually begins. 111 --- Page 131 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Figure 5.4 BreasTsTroke pullouT Preparation 1.

As a result, the stroke is highly rhythmic, and in order to do it well you need the lower half of your body to work independently of the upper half. This dynamic involves give and take, and there are many effective styles of breaststroke. One thing, however, is true for them all: If your timing is off, you spend a lot of energy going very slowly—or going nowhere fast. score your success If you scored at least 32 points, then you have completed this step.

It was developed in the 1930s as a way to minimize the drag caused by underwater recovery of the arms in the breaststroke. Early variants of the butterfly (referred to as the butterfly breaststroke) used an over-the-water recovery with a breaststroke kick. This technique was much faster than the breaststroke but required a great deal of strength. It was not until the 1950s that the butterfly was con- sidered a separate stroke from breaststroke, and the use of a dolphin kick was added to the official competition rules governing the new stroke. As mentioned in step 5, the butterfly, like the breaststroke, is considered a “short- axis” stroke but is really a timing-and-rhythm stroke. It does involve rotating on a shorter axis (i.e., through the chest, laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes: • Good body position • Effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Acceleration throughout the stroke •

Now, sneak your hands back up along your body, keeping your elbows in until you are at the first position, then repeat. This is very similar to the breaststroke pullout. To increase DiFFiculTY • Once you are comfortable with this drill, add one dolphin kick prior to moving your hands back and another after finishing the pull at your thighs.

BuTTerFlY arM recoVerY Many swimmers struggle with arm recovery (figure 6.7) if they perform the pull incorrectly. It is easy for the arms to recover over the water if the hands accelerate through the stroke and finish at or slightly wider than the hips. The reason is that the momentum of the stroke carries the hands through the exit, which means that less effort is required to bring the arms and hands back to the forward position. The key is to finish the stroke fast and feather the hands so that they exit the water smoothly, pinkies out first. If the stroke is finished with an acceleration, the forward movement of the arms requires

BreaThing The timing of the breath is critical to a good butterfly stroke. As with the breast- stroke, breathing at the wrong time during the butterfly stroke cycle not only slows the stroke but also increases the rate of fatigue. However, whereas mistimed breath- ing in the breaststroke mainly makes you slow, mistimed breathing in the butterfly exhausts you and forces you to stop. 130 --- Page 150 Text --- Butterfly To learn when to breathe and how to do so with proper technique, you use a few simple mental cues and drills (figure 6.8). The first cue addresses how high to rise out of the water when getting air. Rising too high reduces momentum and undulation. As a corrective, think of pushing your chin forward rather than lifting your head. The next concern is the timing of your breathing. Many swimmers breathe late. To avoid this pitfall, initiate the forward chin movement as you start your pull and make it a quick breath. How often you breathe depends on your individual needs and development as a swimmer. Conventional wisdom used to recommend breath- ing on every other stroke and leaving your face in the water rather than getting air on each stroke. However, after several Olympians chose to breathe either on every stroke or in a one-two pattern, it became apparent that butterfly swimmers should breathe as often as they need to—but not more.

Butterfly Breathing Drill Dolphin-Dive sneak-a-Breath This drill involves lying on the water and performing a catch and pull along with the kicking motion from the first drills.

TwO-hanD TOuch Turn The two-hand touch turn is the one used in competition and recreational swimming for both the breaststroke and the butterfly. To perform this turn, the approach (figure 7.5) is made on the front, and in competition pools it can be gauged by markings on the pool bottom. Specifically, the centerline of each lane has a T shape close to the wall that provides competitive swimmers with a target. Since both the breaststroke 147 --- Page 167 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success and the butterfly are forward-looking strokes, you can also easily sneak a peek at your distance from the wall. Many pools also have a spillover gutter system or a

that provides competitive swimmers with a target. Since both the breaststroke 147 --- Page 167 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success and the butterfly are forward-looking strokes, you can also easily sneak a peek at your distance from the wall. Many pools also have a spillover gutter system or a low coping that allows you to grasp the wall with your hands. This technique reduces your length and thus the resistance during your turn and causes your feet to come up close to the wall for the exchange. Figure 7.5 TwO-hanD TOuch Turn: apprOach Preparation 1. As you approach the wall, take a final stroke and reach for the wall with both hands. 2. Stretch for the wall rather than taking an additional short stroke. a Execution 1. As your momentum carries you into the wall, grasp it (or push away from it with your hands). 2. Drive your knees up toward your chest. 3.

MissTep You rotate on the wall and are facedown. cOrrecTiOn Draw your knees up while twisting only slightly so that you are on your side when you are ready to push. The last part of the turn is the breakout (figure 7.8), in which you transition from the streamlined position to a swimming position. For the butterfly and breaststroke, the first movement is the kick, so you will need to be near the surface. To get there, simply push your chin forward. Please note that you should not necessarily lift your head; instead, bring your chin forward, which causes you to rise to the surface grad- ually. As in all of these breakouts, make sure to be neither too shallow nor too deep. 150 --- Page 170 Text --- Turns Figure 7.8 TwO-hanD TOuch Turn: BreakOuT Preparation 1. Push off in a streamline.

The key is to get on and off of the wall quickly with no energy wasted. With this goal in mind, the best turners avoid having their feet and their hands on the wall at the same time. Work toward that goal as you practice the following drills. 151 --- Page 171 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Two-Hand Touch-Turn Drill 1 approach Both the breaststroke and the butterfly are based on good timing and rhythm, and this holds true for the turn. One of the ways to practice being ready for the turn is to make sure you that are aware of your location as you approach. To do this drill, start 5 to 10 yards from the wall. Push off of the bottom and begin kicking toward the wall to get a feel for the rhythm of your approach. Touch the wall with both hands about shoulder-width apart.

The purpose of this drill is to maintain the momentum you generated by pushing off of the wall. Many swimmers lose momen- tum during the breakout, and it is important to maintain as much velocity as you can. This drill is performed by pushing off and either getting into a kicking rhythm for the butterfly or initiating a kick for the breaststroke.

a lot of energy to the start and makes pool depth all the more important. Though traditionally performed from a starting block, this forward dive start can also be done from the side of the pool. Starting blocks may be either removable or permanently installed. They come in a variety of designs, depending on the manufacturer, but generally include a platform angled slightly forward or down toward the water. Some also include a wedge at the back, and this feature is currently considered state of the art for competitive racing blocks. Let’s turn now to the various dive starts. ForWarD or grab Start The forward or grab start (figure 8.3) can be done from the deck or from a block and is used for freestyle, breaststroke, and butterfly. To perform it, stand at the front edge of the block with your toes curled over the edge, then bend at your waist and bend your knees slightly. Next, grab the front edge of the block with both hands; it is very important to keep your neck loose and look down or only slightly forward. This is the set position, in which you should be reasonably comfortable with your center of gravity directly above your feet and ankles. As your feet leave the block, your hips, knees, and ankles should all be on the same line, parallel to the surface of the water, in order to generate maximum forward velocity. Your upper body is angled toward your entry position and your fingers are pointed directly to that spot. As your feet enter the water, you should be 2 to 2.5 feet (0.6-0.75 m) under the sur- face.

are pointed directly to that spot. As your feet enter the water, you should be 2 to 2.5 feet (0.6-0.75 m) under the sur- face. It will take several attempts to find your ideal depth, which depends on which stroke you are swimming and what is most comfortable to you. After your feet enter the water, you are in the streamline phase. Perform this part of the start as described in the stroke-specific step chapters. 164 --- Page 184 Text --- Starts Remember that at the instant you enter the water, you are traveling at the fast- est speed you will achieve in your swim. Therefore, it is crucial to achieve a tight streamline in order to avoid slowing down and to minimize drag. The streamline for freestyle and butterfly involves powerful kicking at very high frequency, whereas the breaststroke streamline involves the breaststroke pullout. The breakout, once again, is the transition from streamlining to swimming. In all of these strokes, the first few strokes after the streamline are crucial for maintaining the momentum you generated in the start and the streamline. To do so, focus on making your first few strokes powerful and flawless. Figure 8.3 ForWarD or grab Start a bb Set 3. At the same time, bring your hands forward toward the stream- 1.

The difference in the track start is the start position. In this position, one foot is forward and the other is back, just like track athletes use for their starts. During the 1960s and 1970s, it was used by some U.S. collegiate swimmers, and in the 1980s a few U.S. swimmers became the first to use it in international competition. They were disqualified, but a chal- lenge to the ruling led to the conclusion that regulations did not require both feet to be at the front of the starting blocks. By the 1990s, the technique had become more widespread, and it is now the standard starting technique for most swimmers. It can

By the 1990s, the technique had become more widespread, and it is now the standard starting technique for most swimmers. It can be done from the deck or from a block, and it is used in freestyle, breaststroke, and butterfly. 168 --- Page 188 Text --- Starts Figure 8.4 traCK Start a bb Set 2.

see which one gets you farther down the pool. After your feet enter the water, you are in the streamline phase. Perform this part of the start as described for each stroke in previous steps. Remember that the instant you enter the water, you are traveling at the fastest speed you will achieve in your swim. Therefore, it is crucial to achieve a tight streamline in order to avoid slowing down and to minimize drag. The streamline for freestyle and butterfly involves pow- erful kicking at very high frequency, whereas the breaststroke streamline involves the breaststroke pullout. The breakout, once again, is the transition phase from streamlining to swimming. As mentioned earlier, push your chin forward slightly to adjust your depth and bring you to the surface for swimming. In all of these swimming strokes, your first few strokes after the streamline are crucial for maintaining the momentum you generated in the start and the streamline. To do so, focus on making your first few strokes powerful and flawless. In addition, this particular type of start involves a few more variables that must be managed. Whether you have your hips forward or back, your timing, and the amount of verti- cal force you put into the start all influence the entry. If your feet do not enter through the same hole in the water as the rest of the body, you may twist, which will influence the way you streamline. You may have to make adjustments with your body and in your streamline to ensure that you can manage the breakout effectively. MISStep You look up, lose your balance, and fall in.

Breakout Drill Kick to the break This drill helps you build on your mastery of the preceding drills by concentrating on the transition from the streamline to swimming. As you have learned, a great deal of momentum is lost with any nonstreamlined position or movement. To perform this drill, do the set, push, and entry and then add vigorous and high-frequency kicking. As you make your way down the pool underwater, push your chin forward and feel yourself rise. When you break the surface, stop. If you are doing the breaststroke, perform one pullout and rise to the surface.

The most common way is to use a horizontal sculling motion with the hands while breaststroke-kicking with one leg at a time. This kick is commonly referred to as the eggbeater. People who struggle with the breaststroke kick can use a version of the flutter kick just as effectively. Either of these kicks can be used for this drill. The drill helps you prepare for times when you are stationary in the water and cannot push off of the bottom to get started. To do the drill, perform a sculling action with your hands in front to keep yourself stationary, then kick your legs and hips up to the surface. You must arch your back to keep your head out of the water, but once you are ready to go, just put your face in and start swimming.

for at least one stroke. Perhaps sight a little more frequently and compensate if you find yourself tending to pull to one side. SWitCh drillS The following drills help you not only with sighting during a competition but also with engaging various muscles in a survival situation. The key in both cases is to perform the skills with minimal energy expenditure. Switch Drill 1 Freestyle-to-Breaststroke Switch As mentioned in step 5, the breaststroke is the slowest of the competitive strokes but offers some advantages. Aside from getting to breathe on every stroke, you also get to look forward, which of course is very helpful when you need to quickly check where you’re going while continuing to make progress. In short, the breaststroke allows you to simultaneously get a peek—for example, at a buoy or landmark—and a little air. To perform this drill, swim seven strokes of freestyle followed by three strokes of breaststroke and then go back to freestyle. tO inCreaSe diFFiCulty • Swim multiple cycles of the drill. tO deCreaSe diFFiCulty • Stop after each switch.

Survival SWimming Sidestroke, though not a competitive stroke, is a great stroke to master for open-water and survival swimming. It allows you to have your face out of the water to breathe and uses a powerful scissorlike kick. Like breaststroke, it derives propulsion almost equally from armstroking and kicking. As the name implies, sidestroke is done on the side; one shoulder and arm are toward the bottom of the pool, and the other shoulder is out of the water with the majority of the arm submerged. As with the other strokes discussed in this book, the best way to master the sidestroke is to master its individual elements separately and then put them all together. Sidestroke Kicking The sidestroke employs a scissor kick (figure 9.7), which differs from the flutter kick in that the legs are wide apart and the swimmer is on his or her side. To perform the scis- sor kick, bring the leg that is closer to the surface forward by drawing the knee toward your chest. The leg that is closer to the bottom of the pool extends back so

meet your bottom arm. 4. As your hands touch, turn the hand of your upper arm to put pressure on the water down to your side. 5. As you do so, sneak your bottom arm forward to the starting position. 6. Repeat. c 205 --- Page 225 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success miSStep You keep splashing at the water with your lead hand. COrreCtiOn Remember to slide the hand forward rather than reach over the water. miSStep You push your lead hand down rather than back to lift your head. COrreCtiOn This is a common temptation as a way to get the head higher; remember, however, to lay your head on your lead arm and then sweep back. Complete Sidestroke The process of putting it all together for the sidestroke is very similar to the process for the breaststroke in that your arm and leg movements must be somewhat inde- pendent. The most effective use of the powerful kick is to perform it while you are extended, with your lead arm out, so be patient. While your legs recover to kick again, your momentum should be maintained by the propulsive force of the pull and armstroke. Do the following to practice the complete sidestroke. PreParation 1. Make sure that you have adequate space to do the stroke. 2. Get into the water and lie on your front in the neutral position. execution 1. With the one arm extended, rotate to the side and sweep your other arm down so that it is closer to the top of the water and your face is turned out of the water. 2.

After you glide for a second or two, pull the arm closest to the bottom of the pool toward your chest in a sweeping motion. 4. At the same time, sneak your upper arm and hand forward to meet your bottom arm. 5. As your hands touch, turn the hand of your upper arm to put pressure on the water down to your side. 6. As you do so, sneak your bottom arm forward to the starting position. 7. Repeat by beginning again with the kick after returning. miSStep You claw at the water while kicking.

Exhale slowly and glide. Roll your face to air, then pull and kick again. elementary BaCkStrOke Though not a competitive stroke, the elementary backstroke (figure 9.9) is an effec- tive open-water tool and a great stroke for survival swimming because it enables you to propel yourself while expending minimal energy. In addition, your face is always out of the water, which enables you to breathe easily. The stroke is performed by incorporating an arm push and a breaststroke kick while lying on your back. Unlike the breaststroke, this stroke involves nearly simultaneous arm and leg movements. Make sure that your arms stay in the water the whole time. When practicing this stroke in a pool, make sure that the backstroke flags are in place or have a
