After all, we use our bodies from head to toe to perform our sport. The complex system of muscles that weaves together over our frames allows us to do the quick, explosive movements, and the long, repetitious movements that make up swimming. Our muscles work in tandem to make it possible to perform tasks as simple as putting on goggles and as lofty as winning Olympic gold. Yet, when we see a fantastic swimmer moving through the water with grace and speed, we don’t associate their speed with muscular strength. Instead we associate it

work in tandem to make it possible to perform tasks as simple as putting on goggles and as lofty as winning Olympic gold. Yet, when we see a fantastic swimmer moving through the water with grace and speed, we don’t associate their speed with muscular strength. Instead we associate it with skill. We notice their skill at reducing drag and maintaining a streamlined body shape. We notice their skill at “feeling” the water and using it to their advantage. We notice their skill at coordinating stroke actions that together produce fluid forward motion. In fact, it is widely accepted that swimming is not a matter of muscling your way through the water. Swimmers have to know how to swim! Still, it is puzzling to see swimmers with such picture-perfect strokes that they could star in a video on stroke technique who, when the time comes to swim fast, are unable to generate speed. Then there are swimmers with equally developed stroke technique who move through the water with such velocity that they appear to be wearing invisible flippers. So, what is the difference? What makes one swimmer able to achieve speed in the water but another swimmer unable to? The main difference is strength. The mechanics of swimming are not based on technique alone but also on the application of force and power. When we swim, our muscles are engaged in an integrated sequence of actions to both exert resistance on the water and to balance and stabilize our bodies so that forward motion is realized. In this way, when two swimmers, both with solid stroke technique, are swimming side by side, the stronger swimmer will be faster. Thus, that fantastic swimmer, who looks like poetry in motion, is in actuality muscling his way through the water! By adding strength

so that forward motion is realized. In this way, when two swimmers, both with solid stroke technique, are swimming side by side, the stronger swimmer will be faster. Thus, that fantastic swimmer, who looks like poetry in motion, is in actuality muscling his way through the water! By adding strength to skill, faster swimming is possible. As the title of this book suggests, strength training for swimming is a very specialized activity. The specific audience and the specific goal of this book 7 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 7 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 10 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming lead us to the logical conclusion that swimming strength is not developed very well through a general approach to strength training. Building useable strength for swimming requires attention to more than making the muscles strong. It requires orientation toward specific aspects of strength. It requires simulation of swimming directionality and tempo. Above all, it requires attention to training multi-muscle movements, like those that make up swimming. General strength training may produce some positive results in a hit or miss fashion, but it can also produce bulk and fatigue that can interfere with swimming. To make sure that strength work produces the intended results for swimmers, it must be designed and structured with swimming in mind. To illustrate this point, I would like to share a story that a swimmer recounted with me about the last year of his long swimming career. He told me that he had been a dedicated swimmer, with twelve years of training and competition experience under his belt. He had enviable technique, and even more enviable endurance. Knocking off 10 x 200 on the 2:30, and swimming double workouts five days a week, was no problem. He was, in fact, a coaches’ ideal of self-motivation, and a

with twelve years of training and competition experience under his belt. He had enviable technique, and even more enviable endurance. Knocking off 10 x 200 on the 2:30, and swimming double workouts five days a week, was no problem. He was, in fact, a coaches’ ideal of self-motivation, and a role model of good work ethic to the rest of his team. He did it all because he dreamed of going to the Olympics. It was more than a dream though; it was a goal, and at the age of 18, he was determined to make the Olympic team. After months of intense training, he found himself at a plateau and decided to supplement his swimming with weights. In addition to swimming over 80,000 each week, he also went to the gym and lifted weights, understanding that more strength would benefit his swimming speed. He developed a routine of exercises from those he observed other people at the gym doing regularly, including all the standard body building lifts. He did bench press, military press and French curls by the dozens. He got to the point that he could lift impressive amounts of weight with little effort. He continued this routine diligently for several months, building a large and well-defined upper body. As the last meet of the season approached, he found himself feeling quite tired, and his test swims were not outstanding, showing a sluggish tempo and higher stroke count than desirable. Still, going into the competition, he maintained his confidence. He believed that because he had worked as hard as he could both in and out of the water, he would make a swimming breakthrough. But after his race, he was stunned to have made no progress at all. In fact, he had clocked a time that he achieved

confidence. He believed that because he had worked as hard as he could both in and out of the water, he would make a swimming breakthrough. But after his race, he was stunned to have made no progress at all. In fact, he had clocked a time that he achieved two years before. Disappointed that all of his dedication and training had made no impact, he became disheartened and soon lost interest in swimming, allowing his dream to slip away. 8 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 8 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 11 Text --- Introduction This sad story is all too common. A swimmer with amazing work ethic and goal-oriented drive gets into a cycle of extreme over-training and non- specific, non-progressive strength training. Despite red flags – including plateau, fatigue, and reduced flexibility – that foretell poor race results, the swimmer keeps training and fails to reach the goal. Coaches and swimmers: This is preventable! This book addresses strength training as a means to achieve more speed in the water, rather than simply a means to become stronger. Emphasis is placed on both the underlying concepts and crucial details of building strength that transfers to swimming. Readers will explore how to structure a strength training program that will work with the swimming routine. Readers will learn about the importance of individualizing training to match a swimmer’s stage of development, level of experience, and swimming specialty. Readers will discover what kinds of activities build usable strength in the water. At the end of the book, a series of strength training routines and circuits are included for each stage of development.

Before skipping right to that chapter, please take time to read the rest of the book first so you will have the background information that will prepare you to get the best results possible. Here is to reaching your swimming dreams! 9 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 9 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 12 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming 10 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 10 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 13 Text --- What Makes Swimmers Fast? 1 WHAT MAKES SWIMMERS FAST? The common goal in competitive swimming is to swim faster and, to a large extent, training is the means to that objective. The evolution of our sport has been marked by countless theories of training, based on emerging science, past results and intuition. Determined swimmers pair with inspired coaches in search of the perfect formula for attaining swimming speed. Training methods using more volume, or less volume but more intensity both in and out of the water, diets with more protein or less protein, and various pre-competition rituals have been designed with the single purpose of defying speed barriers. And swimming times keep dropping, as many of these strategies have resulted in incredible success for individual swimmers. But the fact is no single training formula has worked across the board. Some swimmers do better swimming twice a day, while others only once. Some swimmers will benefit from weight training, while others will get more out of a self-resistance program. Some swimmers can eat anything, anytime, but some have to carefully watch their calorie intake. Some swimmers race better practicing all the way up to the day before the meet, but others need several days, or even weeks of rest. We have come to

more out of a self-resistance program. Some swimmers can eat anything, anytime, but some have to carefully watch their calorie intake. Some swimmers race better practicing all the way up to the day before the meet, but others need several days, or even weeks of rest. We have come to understand that a uniform training strategy for competitive swimming is both ineffective and unrealistic. Differences in stage of development, conditioning and skill level, body type, rate of recovery, and swimming specialty reveal that an individualized approach to training yields the best results. While there is no single alchemy, certain training principles have endured and gained acceptance as integral elements in the quest for swimming speed. 11 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 11 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 14 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming SWIMMING The main element in a swimmer’s training, at every stage of his or her career, must be swimming. Without frequent and ample time in the water, even the best athlete will not be prepared to swim fast because he will not be prepared to swim well. Only time in the water enables a swimmer to develop the swimming technique that leads to the essential ability to “feel” the water. Only time in the water teaches a swimmer to eliminate drag and be more “fishlike.” Only time in the water gives a swimmer the experience of coordinating stroke actions and accessing the best sequence of muscles to accomplish fluid forward motion. Only time in the water enables a swimmer to practice stroke economy, balance and stability in the aquatic environment. There is no substitute for time in the water. To be a faster swimmer, one first has to be a good swimmer. ATHLETIC BASE The saying goes, “better athletes make better swimmers.” There is no way around it.

swimmer to practice stroke economy, balance and stability in the aquatic environment. There is no substitute for time in the water. To be a faster swimmer, one first has to be a good swimmer. ATHLETIC BASE The saying goes, “better athletes make better swimmers.” There is no way around it. Swimming is not a sport that gives immediate gratification. When a person comes into competitive swimming without a base of athleticism, a great deal of time and energy must be devoted to building that base, to prepare the person to take on the rigors of training for competitive swimming. In contrast, when these qualities are already present, a swimmer is able to excel faster. A swimmer who comes into swimming with an athletic base in place is able to concentrate on developing solid swimming skills, gaining swimming experience, and swimming fast! 12 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 12 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 15 Text --- What Makes Swimmers Fast? Athleticism is defined in many ways. For the purposes of this book, we will measure athleticism in the following terms: 1) Cardiovascular fitness — ability of the body to transport and utilize oxygen 2) Flexibility — range of motion 3) Coordination — integrating movements into unified effective effort 4) Strength — power, force, explosiveness and stability against resistance An active lifestyle beginning in childhood that includes casual and organized activities that involve running, jumping, climbing and balancing builds overall athletic ability. STRENGTH TRAINING When analyzing the qualities of athleticism that are most developed by swimmers, we see that, without a doubt, competitive swimming provides some of the best cardiovascular fitness of any sport. The full body requirements and repetitive nature of our sport promotes high levels of aerobic capacity and cardiovascular efficiency, much like runners and cyclists possess, but with the added requirement

by swimmers, we see that, without a doubt, competitive swimming provides some of the best cardiovascular fitness of any sport. The full body requirements and repetitive nature of our sport promotes high levels of aerobic capacity and cardiovascular efficiency, much like runners and cyclists possess, but with the added requirement of propelling ourselves through a medium thicker than air. Swimming also requires mastery of breathing timing (more so than any other sport). Whereas on land, athletes have no restrictions on breathing, in swimming getting new air is limited to the time when the face is out of the water, ultimately boosting fitness even further. 13 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 13 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 16 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Swimmers are also very flexible, and in many cases, almost too flexible. The loose joints (especially in the shoulders) that enable a swimmer to reach and stroke effectively, and move so fluidly can also allow the bones to move around at the joint, causing inflammation and pain. The only area where swimmers often lack enough flexibility is at the ankle, where it is desirable to have the ability to easily point the toes and create a straight line to the knee. Still, among land athletes, only ballet dancers have better ankle flexibility than swimmers. Swimmers are very coordinated, as well. The complex nature of swimming uses every part of the body to move forward in a series of movements within each stroke cycle, encouraging an intuitive understanding of the kinetic chain. And, in what other sport does the athlete propel himself or herself at full speed toward a wall, then tuck and reverse directions without slowing down? Finally, we come to strength, the final measure of athletic condition. As we compare the strength developed by swimmers with the strength

kinetic chain. And, in what other sport does the athlete propel himself or herself at full speed toward a wall, then tuck and reverse directions without slowing down? Finally, we come to strength, the final measure of athletic condition. As we compare the strength developed by swimmers with the strength developed by other athletes, it is clear that swimmers do not develop the same degree of musculature as many other athletes. For example, football players and weightlifters develop more muscle bulk than swimmers in order to succeed in their sports. But since swimming does not have the same strength requirements as football and weightlifting, should we be concerned with strength levels in swimming? The answer is yes! While swimmers do not need muscle size to excel, they do need muscle strength. There are four types of strength that swimmers should be concerned with: 14 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 14 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 17 Text --- What Makes Swimmers Fast? FORCE Force is the maximum amount of resistance that can be applied. In the case of swimming, force refers to the maximum resistance that can be applied to the water, in one stroke, from the beginning of the catch through the end of the underwater stroke, accelerating from beginning to end. More deliverable force improves a swimmer’s distance per stroke, ultimately producing more potential for speed. POWER Power is the ability to maintain force over time. In swimming, power is required to do the series of strokes it takes to complete any single lap or distance in the pool. A swimmer who is able to keep a higher percentage of force throughout his or her race all the way to the end with less fatigue is able to maintain more even splits, and therefore produce a faster overall time. EXPLOSIVENESS Explosiveness

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
any single lap or distance in the pool. A swimmer who is able to keep a higher percentage of force throughout his or her race all the way to the end with less fatigue is able to maintain more even splits, and therefore produce a faster overall time. EXPLOSIVENESS Explosiveness is the ability to recruit a burst of force. In swimming, explosiveness is beneficial for fast starts, turns and sprinting. A swimmer with good explosive strength is quick off the blocks and has turns that set him or her apart from the field. Explosiveness is also the basis of sprinting. However, it should be pointed out that swimming even the shortest race, with its 20 to 30-second average time span, takes more than just explosiveness, it also takes power and force to sprint well. STABILITY Stability refers to one’s ability to balance and control movements from within the body. In swimming, we must be able to create and maintain integrity in motion, and do so without the support of the ground. The ability to stabilize oneself is crucial to producing forward motion while floating. A swimmer with good stability is able to generate power from the center of the body and send it upward to the arms and downward to the legs in a continual chain reaction to generate speed. A carefully designed strength training program enhances a swimmer’s water training, dramatically enriching its value. In addition to swimming, strength training that addresses all four kinds of strength should be considered an essential part of a swimmer’s long-term training. 15 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 15 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 18 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming HOW LAND-BASED STRENGTH TRAINING ENCOURAGES SWIMMING SPEED Resistance is the basis of all strength building.

considered an essential part of a swimmer’s long-term training. 15 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 15 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 18 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming HOW LAND-BASED STRENGTH TRAINING ENCOURAGES SWIMMING SPEED Resistance is the basis of all strength building. Although there are some effective ways of increasing resistance during swimming, including hand paddles, tethered swimming, drag suits and towing chutes and pails, the reality is that none of these methods can deliver the results in terms of building strength that can be achieved on land. With more gravitational effect on land than in the water, more load is possible. Strategic strength training that develops the force required to resist a load on land builds the swimmer’s ability to apply more force to the underwater stroke, both in the catch and the acceleration of the arm toward the finish, thus moving his or her body farther and faster per stroke with less fatigue. In addition to this, self-stabilization, especially in the horizontal swimming position, is much more challenging out of the water. By learning to maintain body position against gravity on land, a swimmer will develop a stronger foundation to swim from. With less resistance in the air than in the water, the tempo of movements can be quicker on land. Strategic strength training that develops the power to repeatedly move a load through the air gives the swimmer more strength to overcome the thickness of the water. It also brings an increased and sustainable tempo to his or her swimming stroke. In addition, practicing true explosive actions on land gives a swimmer quicker reaction time to his or her starts, more speed off the walls in turns, and a solid base for sprinting. By making use of gravity to increase load, and by making use of the “thin”

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
her swimming stroke. In addition, practicing true explosive actions on land gives a swimmer quicker reaction time to his or her starts, more speed off the walls in turns, and a solid base for sprinting. By making use of gravity to increase load, and by making use of the “thin” environment of the air to increase rate, strength is developed better and faster on land than it would be in the water. Strength training on land increases force potential, improves core stability, builds deliverable power, and develops explosiveness, all of which positively encourage more speed and decrease fatigue in the water. A swimmer who uses the ideal environment to build strength brings an advantage back to the ideal environment for swimming. 16 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 16 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 19 Text --- What Makes Swimmers Fast? WHY SWIMMING IS NOT ENOUGH In the aquatic environment, resistance and gravity provide both challenges and advantages. These challenges make strength the most difficult athletic quality to develop through water training alone. The advantages make strength the least noticeable athletic quality in swimmers. Swimmers, in fact, are often are so developed in terms of fitness, flexibility and coordination that strength is overlooked. Swimmers spend a great deal of time learning the essential skill of overcoming the resistance of the water. We search for the best body position so we will slide through the water without interrupting it, avoiding drag that will slow us down, much like an airplane that is designed to cut through the air with the least resistance. But in addition to learning to treat the water like air, we must also learn to treat it like rock. We must learn to use the resistance of the water to our advantage. We must be able to grab hold of it, like

through the air with the least resistance. But in addition to learning to treat the water like air, we must also learn to treat it like rock. We must learn to use the resistance of the water to our advantage. We must be able to grab hold of it, like it was solid, anchoring our hand at a point in front of us, then move our body past that point, similar to a rock climber who grasps the rock at a point above, then lifts his or her body beyond that point. Applying resistance to the water takes strength, and just like a more streamlined swimmer has an advantage, a stronger swimmer also has an advantage. But training in the water limits our ability to develop strength in two ways. First, the thickness of the water makes the rate of each motion to advance the body slower than it would on land. Second, in the reduced gravity environment of the water, the swimmer’s body weight is lighter, which produces less load for the swimmer to move. The obvious question that arises is: if our medium is water, why should we be concerned with moving at the rate we could on land, or being able to move a larger load than we need to in the water? The answer is, that when we are able to recruit more force, power, explosiveness and stability, in combination with using good swimming skills, we are able to achieve more speed in the water. Land-based strength training builds useable strength for swimmers. A training routine that combines swimming and strength work on land gives swimmers an edge over water-based training alone. 17 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 17 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 20 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming MORE BENEFITS OF STRENGTH TRAINING While the

INJURY PREVENTION Strength training is one of the most proactive steps a swimmer can take to prevent injuries, especially to the shoulders. The recognizable physique of a swimmer features large shoulders and a well-developed upper body, but is often punctuated by poor posture. The shortened chest muscles and lengthened back muscles developed by swimmers can result in posture imbalance, often accompanied by shoulders that drop forward, and are sometimes internally rotated. Long-term swimming with this posture can lead to inflammation around the shoulders and pain when the bones are not held firmly in place on all sides. Eventually, if not corrected, such an imbalance can lead to injury that can take a swimmer out of action. Strength training can correct imbalances by targeting the stabilizing muscles around the shoulder joints. Posture can also be improved by targeting the muscles of the upper back. Balanced strength and better posture help a swimmer remain injury free. 18 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 18 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 21 Text --- What Makes Swimmers Fast? TRAINING TIME MANAGEMENT Another benefit of strength training is the management of training time. Limitations on water time, as well as limits on the productive swimming a person can be expected to do in one session can lead to training content deficiencies.

training is the management of training time. Limitations on water time, as well as limits on the productive swimming a person can be expected to do in one session can lead to training content deficiencies. As we try to include every training element into our limited water time, we may end up short on every element. By supplementing water training with additional time dedicated to land-based strength work, more value can be achieved in with the overall training routine. Precious water time can be used to practice solid technique, including stroke coordination, the elimination of drag, refining “feel” for the water, and to experience swimming economically at any speed. Land work can be used to develop the full spectrum of swimming-specific strength, where it is developed most efficiently. NEW FEEDBACK Strength training also adds a new dimension of feedback to a swimmer’s routine. It is common for swimmers to become so accustomed to swimming that they forget to pay attention to the mechanics of what they are doing in the water. Land-based strength training provides a new way to “connect” with the physical actions of the sport. In addition, swimmers can observe improvement in strength as they adapt to the workload. More repetitions, more resistance, and faster tempo achieved over time on land give a swimmer concrete feedback that they are improving, thereby building confidence and motivation. 19 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 19 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 22 Text --- 20 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 20 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 23 Text --- Making Strength Training Count 2 MAKING STRENGTH TRAINING COUNT The ultimate effectiveness of a strength training program is measured in terms of what is accomplished in the pool.

--- Making Strength Training Count 2 MAKING STRENGTH TRAINING COUNT The ultimate effectiveness of a strength training program is measured in terms of what is accomplished in the pool. There must be positive results. To make sure this happens, the strength training program should be designed and redesigned to meet that objective. It should evolve as the swimmer’s strength evolves and consider the individual swimmer’s changing needs. This means that careful observation and monitoring must be an essential element of the program. By evaluating results, or lack of results, we can tailor the program to work better or take positive steps to redirect efforts. Ongoing evaluation should consider a number of issues, as outlined below. TRANSFERABILITY The key to a successful strength training program is that every activity must be transferable to swimming speed. If it doesn’t transfer, then it is a waste of time, or worse, it could even hinder faster swimming. Every strength training exercise can make a swimmer tired, but once the swimmer recovers, does the new strength improve his or her swimming speed? In order to get strength work to transfer to swimming speed, it is important to perform activities that use swimming-like movement and target major swimming-specific muscle groups that together produce that movement, including both visible and underlying muscles. We must strengthen the muscles that move us forward as well as those that stabilize us. It is important to consider directionality when applying resistance on land. Our primary effort should be focused in simulating the direction of swimming. It is also important to mimic swimming tempo as much as possible. A tempo slower than swimming tempo will not transfer to faster speed in the water. 21 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 21 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 24 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Finally, at

the direction of swimming. It is also important to mimic swimming tempo as much as possible. A tempo slower than swimming tempo will not transfer to faster speed in the water. 21 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 21 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 24 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Finally, at the stage of a swimmer’s career when he is specializing in particular events, it is important to focus on strength work that will benefit the swimmer’s specialty. Strength work for these specialists should maximize the strong aspects of the swimmer’s event and build up the weak points. For instance, if a swimmer is specializing in the 200 fly and has awesome stroke efficiency, but tends to lose tempo on the last 50, the emphasis of strength work should be on training for force (the strong point) as well as building power (the weak point). However, a 50 freestyle specialist who is an awesome finisher but needs to improve reaction time off the blocks, should focus on training for power (the strong point) as well as building explosiveness (the weak point). ADAPTATION Strength training is based on the premise that when muscles are stressed, they adapt to that stress, thus becoming stronger. Because the process of stressing muscles actually creates tiny tears in the muscle fibers, they must be allowed to rest and rebuild before they can become stronger. For this reason, strength building must be considered a long-term activity, designed to build strength gradually over time, using periods of stress and rest. When adaptation is allowed to occur in this way, it is important that the program evolve, providing new challenges to swimmers as they adapt. Such challenges can take the form of doing the same exercise with more load, more repetitions, or faster repetitions depending on the objective. Or

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
and rest. When adaptation is allowed to occur in this way, it is important that the program evolve, providing new challenges to swimmers as they adapt. Such challenges can take the form of doing the same exercise with more load, more repetitions, or faster repetitions depending on the objective. Or a swimmer could be asked to perform a more complex action than before. Simply repeating the same stress that the swimmer has already adapted to will not increase strength. Each time a swimmer adapts, new demands must be introduced. By using this kind of progression, a swimmer will develop strength more steadily through his or her career. 22 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 22 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 25 Text --- Making Strength Training Count There is no hard and fast timeline for adaptation. Just as with swimming, strength training does not produce immediate results. Patience is required. A conservative approach, using periodic test sets once a month to gauge adaptation, should determine when new challenges should be presented. ORIENTATION When exposed to resistance, muscle fibers adapt and develop, resulting in more strength. The kind of muscle fiber we develop depends on the amount, duration and rate of the resistance. Strength training can develop either slow or fast twitch muscle fiber. Slow twitch muscle fiber is associated with endurance and stamina. Strength training that focuses on developing power builds slow twitch muscle. Slow twitch muscle fiber enables us to do continuous or repetitive movements over a period of time. Fast twitch muscle fiber is associated with speed and agility. Strength training that focuses on developing force and explosiveness builds fast twitch muscle. Fast twitch muscle fiber enables us to sprint and produce bursts of acceleration. That being said, it is important to remember that in swimming, every event (no matter how short

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
fiber is associated with speed and agility. Strength training that focuses on developing force and explosiveness builds fast twitch muscle. Fast twitch muscle fiber enables us to sprint and produce bursts of acceleration. That being said, it is important to remember that in swimming, every event (no matter how short or how long) benefits from both slow and fast twitch muscle strength. While fast twitch muscle fiber is most important for sprinting, even the shortest swimming event requires a number of repetitions of a stroke to be performed over time. Therefore, some slow twitch fiber is also important for the sprinter to have a strong finish. Likewise, while slow twitch is most important for long distance swimming, some fast twitch muscle is essential for the distance swimmer to develop the force and explosive strength that would allow him or her to do quicker starts and all those turns. Swimming is an activity that builds slow twitch muscle very well. However, not a great deal of fast twitch muscle is built by swimming. This leads some to conclude that the orientation of a strength training program for swimmers should focus on slow twitch development because it is the kind of strength 23 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 23 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 26 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming that swimmers use most. But that is only half of the picture. The reason swimmers engage in land-based strength training is to build more strength than they can achieve in the water. If the goal of strength training is more speed then our efforts should address building fast twitch muscle fiber, the type of muscle fiber associated with speed. The most effective strength training program, oriented toward the goal of more speed, must actively address fast twitch muscle development in addition to supplementing

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
the goal of strength training is more speed then our efforts should address building fast twitch muscle fiber, the type of muscle fiber associated with speed. The most effective strength training program, oriented toward the goal of more speed, must actively address fast twitch muscle development in addition to supplementing the slow twitch work we already get in the pool and need to swim stroke after stroke. Every individual naturally possesses either more slow twitch muscle or more fast twitch muscle that helps determine what activities they will favor. In swimming, those with more natural slow twitch muscle tend to excel in long distance events and seem to prefer them, while those with more natural fast twitch muscle tend to excel in the sprint events and seem to like them more. Training, however, can change this. While people are born with a predisposition for endurance or speed, the amount of total muscle fiber responsible for natural ability is very small. In fact, the majority of muscle fiber in the human body is neither fast nor slow twitch. It is convertible, or responsive, to training. Convertible muscle fiber can be trained to work as fast twitch or slow twitch. This wealth of convertible muscle fiber suggests some interesting possibilities. Would a natural sprinter be able to develop more slow twitch muscle fiber and excel at long distances as well? Would a natural distance swimmer be able to develop more fast twitch muscle and also excel at the sprint events? Certainly the presence of convertible muscle fiber offers swimmers the opportunity to train for more versatility. However, at some point in a swimmer’s career, success in certain events leads that swimmer to narrow his or her focus a bit. At that point, training too should be focused toward particular specialties. Training equally

presence of convertible muscle fiber offers swimmers the opportunity to train for more versatility. However, at some point in a swimmer’s career, success in certain events leads that swimmer to narrow his or her focus a bit. At that point, training too should be focused toward particular specialties. Training equally for all distances could reduce the results at either extreme. Some sprinters can develop a great deal of bulk, resulting in more resistance and density in the water, in addition to less flexibility that would hinder long distance performance. Conversely, the stroke tempo of most distance swimmers is too slow to achieve great sprinting success. By training for all distances, a swimmer could expect to become pretty fast across the board, but not very fast at any one event. By specializing, a swimmer maximizes performance by training convertible muscle fiber to enhance natural skills. 24 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 24 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 27 Text --- Making Strength Training Count VARIATION The concept of alternating stress and rest suggests that a swimmer should not do strength training on a daily basis. Actually, for some swimmers, a well-designed strength training program can be done on sequential days, although it is advisable to incorporate one to two days off per week for “pure” rest. The design of a successful daily program accomplishes the stress and rest model by having the swimmer perform upper body exercises on one day and lower body exercises the next day. On the upper body work day, the lower body rests, and on the lower body work day, the upper body rests. Building in variation in training also keeps a swimmer sharp, both mentally and physically. A creatively designed program uses a diverse array of exercises to meet each training objective. For instance, if the objective is explosiveness,

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
lower body rests, and on the lower body work day, the upper body rests. Building in variation in training also keeps a swimmer sharp, both mentally and physically. A creatively designed program uses a diverse array of exercises to meet each training objective. For instance, if the objective is explosiveness, a swimmer could be given leaps for height, 15-yard running sprints, or a speed jump rope activity. If the objective is core stability, a swimmer could be given a two-minute plank, a series of “V” ups, or some “left rights” with a medicine ball. If the objective is power, a swimmer could be given fifteen minutes of rowing, some stretch cord work, or as many dips as they can do in a minute. This sort of variation in training adds interest and can boost a swimmer’s coordination, as he or she is required to accomplish new and different actions with the same muscles groups. The crucial point is that every exercise that is added to the mix must bring the swimmer closer to the objective. 25 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 25 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 28 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Variation also makes things fun. Swimmers spend a lot of time with their faces in the water, alone with their thoughts, looking at the black line on the bottom of the pool. A good variety of land-based strength training gives swimmers the opportunity to socialize while they train, laugh together as they observe each other’s initially awkward efforts, and motivate each other as they master the coordination of a new exercise. OVER-TRAINING In general, swimmers have a great work ethic. The combination of mental toughness and a highly developed fitness level enables them to keep working when they are tired. While, in many ways, this is an admirable

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
and motivate each other as they master the coordination of a new exercise. OVER-TRAINING In general, swimmers have a great work ethic. The combination of mental toughness and a highly developed fitness level enables them to keep working when they are tired. While, in many ways, this is an admirable trait, it also leaves swimmers vulnerable to over-training. The danger of over- training becomes a real concern especially when strength training is added to a swimmer’s routine. It is important to remember that the main objective of strength training is to enable a swimmer to produce more speed in the pool. If strength training is leaving a swimmer continually too tired to swim well, he or she is probably over-training. 26 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 26 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 29 Text --- Making Strength Training Count Signs of over-training include continual early fatigue in swim practice, slow tempo, poor race results, plateau, slow adaptation, insomnia, impatience, prolonged grumpiness and lack of interest. Over-training should be distinguished from the temporary fatigue associated with an intense cycle of training that is followed by a planned cycle of rest, although it may be hard to tell the difference. However, a swimmer who is temporarily fatigued will respond positively to rest and perform better after resting. A swimmer who is over-trained will not show much speed improvement after rest because he has not successfully adapted along the way. The best way to deal with over-training is to make sure it doesn’t happen. Careful and ongoing monitoring of progress is required. This is the responsibility of the coach because often the swimmer will just keep working, focused on the motto he or she has heard throughout his or her swimming career, “If you want to be fast, you have to work hard.” If a swimmer

ongoing monitoring of progress is required. This is the responsibility of the coach because often the swimmer will just keep working, focused on the motto he or she has heard throughout his or her swimming career, “If you want to be fast, you have to work hard.” If a swimmer is showing signs of over-training, it should not be ignored. Reduce training, either in terms of duration, intensity or frequency, both in and out of the pool. It might be necessary for the swimmer to take a few days off to recover, then start fresh with a new training plan. If caught early, a few days off will allow a swimmer to get back on the right track. Long-term over-training can result in a season of frustration and an associated drop in confidence and a loss of motivation to continue in the sport. Coaches must learn to emphasize the fact that rest is good just as strongly as they emphasize the benefits of hard work. The former is a difficult concept for many swimmers to accept, but it is an important one. Sometimes, just working hard does not result in speed; it results in an overly tired swimmer. There is a very fine line between working very hard and working too hard, and every swimmer’s threshold is slightly different. Finding each swimmer’s balance point is a crucial part of designing a training program that results in faster swimming. 27 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 27 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 30 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming SEASON PLANNING The goal of strength training is to progressively produce more swimming speed over a swimmer’s career, by season, and from meet to meet.

Strength Training for Faster Swimming SEASON PLANNING The goal of strength training is to progressively produce more swimming speed over a swimmer’s career, by season, and from meet to meet. Because the ultimate test of the effectiveness of a strength training program is race performance, we must plan our program with competition dates in mind. To ensure that a swimmer is ready to race well, the training plan must accommodate some degree of rest before race day. However, with swim meets scheduled an average of once per week during high school and college seasons, and once every two weeks for age group swimmers, planning for competitions poses training continuity problems. In addition, when frequently accommodating rest before swim meets, the cumulative effect of training is hard to achieve. For this reason, it is a good idea to look at the season as a whole and work toward a positive conclusion, allowing for benchmark or qualifying opportunities along the way. By defining three levels of competitions, some meets will be identified as priority events and incorporate planned breaks in training, while some will be treated as part of the training. 28 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 28 12.07.11 12:11 --- OCR from Page 30 Image 1 --- COLORADO --- Page 31 Text --- Making Strength Training Count PRACTICE MEETS In preparation for practice meets, little or no change in the training routine should be made. Just as we “swim through” some competitions, we can also strength train through them. No best times should be expected. Rather than best times, the objective should be stroke quality. TARGET MEETS In advance of target meets, the swimmer should be allowed some time to rest. While some swimmers require more rest than others, even one or two days break from the strength training routine can give a

be expected. Rather than best times, the objective should be stroke quality. TARGET MEETS In advance of target meets, the swimmer should be allowed some time to rest. While some swimmers require more rest than others, even one or two days break from the strength training routine can give a swimmer’s muscles an opportunity to recover enough to perform well without seriously interrupting the long-term strength training plan. Signs of improvement toward the strength training objective should be visible. Some best times can be expected. CHAMPIONSHIP MEETS Strength training should stop about two weeks before the championship meet to allow the swimmer time to adapt and rebuild fully. Although some swimmers get nervous that they will lose their strength, they should be assured that the work they have done on land will be maintained by using it in the pool during this strength training break. Best times should be achieved. After the competition season, the off-season period can provide a good block of time to build a solid base of well-rounded strength for the next competition season. It also provides the opportunity to make modifications in a swimmer’s strength training routine as determined through observation and evaluation of the swimmer’s overall performance during the season past. 29 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 29 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 32 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming 30 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 30 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 33 Text --- The Swimming Muscles 3 THE SWIMMING MUSCLES Swimming is considered by many to be the best form of full body exercise.

best form of full body exercise. The well-documented cardiovascular benefits of swimming focus largely on its healthy effect on the heart and lungs. Upon closer examination, we see that the function of the heart and lungs is to carry oxygen-rich blood to the working muscles and to transport oxygen-depleted blood away from them. What makes swimming particularly good for the heart and lungs is that so many muscles are being used at the same time. In fact, swimming uses almost every muscle in the body in a coordinated and repetitive, cycling manner that exposes them to sustained exertion in a medium that is thicker than air. Well-conditioned swimmers, in general, have extremely low resting heart rates, a measure of good fitness, and are known to have one of the most developed capillary systems of all athletes. As a swimmer is able to swim farther and faster, the oxygen demand of the muscles increases. As the heart and lungs adapt to meet the demand, new capillaries form, branching out from the existing blood supply network to better provide the muscles in use with more oxygen. Not only does swimming use more muscles at once than most other sports, it also uses muscles in ways that we don’t often use them for other activities. As erect beings, humans spend most of their time using our muscles from the vertical position. However, because swimming is done from a horizontal position, muscle exertion is initiated and carried out in different planes than we are used to. To illustrate this point, compare the actions 31 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 31 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 34 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming performed with the arms in rowing with those used in swimming. They have many similarities and use many of the same muscles. Rowing, in

used to. To illustrate this point, compare the actions 31 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 31 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 34 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming performed with the arms in rowing with those used in swimming. They have many similarities and use many of the same muscles. Rowing, in fact, is a land exercise often recommended for swimmers. Both rowers and swimmers initiate the arm movement with their arms extended in front of them. Both pull toward the body. Both use a cycling arm action. However, in rowing, the athlete’s body position is perpendicular to the arms. In swimming, the body is positioned parallel to the arms. This fundamental difference distinguishes the way the muscles exert themselves in swimming from the way they do in rowing and most other land activities. The foot position of swimmers is another good example of the unique way muscles are used in swimming. Without the ground as a foundation, the feet take on a completely different role in the water. The primary human foot position is perpendicular to the leg, creating a base to stand on and spring from. In swimming, this foot position is used only in a limited fashion for the breaststroke kick, and for starts and turns. Instead, the primary foot position for swimmers is pointed, heel to toe. From this position, it is the top of the foot that applies the most resistance rather than the sole of the feet. This seemingly minor difference is central to how the muscles in the entire leg are used. In fact, it is common for people who are not used to swimming to experience cramps in the calf and in the arch of the foot when they swim due to the different requirements of the muscles when resistance is applied with the

muscles in the entire leg are used. In fact, it is common for people who are not used to swimming to experience cramps in the calf and in the arch of the foot when they swim due to the different requirements of the muscles when resistance is applied with the top of the foot. With all this in mind, a strength training program that will be effective for swimmers must consider the full body requirements of swimming, the unique ways swimmers use their muscles, and role each muscle group performs in the act of swimming. 32 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 32 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 35 Text --- The Swimming Muscles LINKING MUSCLE MOVEMENT Looking at the anatomy of the human body and the distribution of muscles, we can see that the largest muscles are situated closer to the center of the body. We can also see that the fibers that make up each muscle have a distinct grain. By examining the direction Muscle distribution and grain of this grain, as well as how the muscles overlap each other, and the point each muscle anchors to the bone, we get an indication of what sort of action each muscle group is capable of and responsible for. With this knowledge, we can better connect muscles to movement and employ them to better move us through the water. The sequence of muscles called to action in coordinated swimming works in a chain reaction to move the swimmer forward. This flow of energy travels through the body, passing from one muscle group to another throughout each stroke cycle, producing efficient forward motion. Often referred to as the kinetic chain, this connected movement is what a swimmer should strive to simulate in strength training. Rather than isolating one muscle, consider that that muscle is just

through the body, passing from one muscle group to another throughout each stroke cycle, producing efficient forward motion. Often referred to as the kinetic chain, this connected movement is what a swimmer should strive to simulate in strength training. Rather than isolating one muscle, consider that that muscle is just part of a larger movement. Imagine a baseball player standing at bat. His arms support the bat, but when he swings to hit the ball, not only will the muscles of his arms come into play but he will employ the muscles in his shoulders, chest, abdomen, 33 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 33 12.07.11 12:11 --- Page 36 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming upper and lower back, and legs in one connected motion to send the ball flying fast and far. If instead he used the muscles in his arms in isolation, even with all his strength, the velocity and trajectory of the ball would land it at the pitcher’s feet. It is the same with swimming. An effective swimmer throws his or her body into each stroke, employing not only the muscles of the arms but those in the shoulders, chest, abdomen, upper and lower back, and legs to produce a connected motion with each stroke that moves the body farther and faster, and with less fatigue, than if the arms were used in isolation. An ineffective swimmer moves his or her arms and legs independently of each other, expending a great deal of effort to basically perform four separate actions, rather than one connected action. Linking the muscles together in coordinated movement allows the swimmer to produce better forward motion with less effort. For this reason, strength training for swimmers should involve multiple muscle groups, to simulate swimming motion as much as possible, rather than training muscles

four separate actions, rather than one connected action. Linking the muscles together in coordinated movement allows the swimmer to produce better forward motion with less effort. For this reason, strength training for swimmers should involve multiple muscle groups, to simulate swimming motion as much as possible, rather than training muscles in isolation. MOVING AND STABILIzING 34 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 34 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 37 Text --- The Swimming Muscles Muscles throughout the body are involved in creating forward movement for the swimmer. Each of these muscles is dedicated to produce specific motions that contribute to the swimming motion as a whole. While muscles create movement for the swimmer, they also have another important function. Muscles also perform as stabilizers. Like in other sports, muscles provide stability to the body in motion and the joints. The muscles that stabilize the knee, for example, keep the bones of the upper and lower leg aligned. Imagine what would happen if there were no stabilizers at the knee; walking, standing, and kicking would be impossible. Unique to swimming is the additional role of the muscles in providing stability to the moving body as it floats. Without the ground to stand on, swimmers must create their own foundation of stability. In order to move forward in swimming, muscles in one area of the body must be engaged in balancing the effect of an action in another part of the body. These stabilizing muscles maintain tension against the resistance that is being applied. Without good tension, the effect that is produced is not forward motion as desired but a fishtailing or bobbing movement. Muscles are often categorized as movers and stabilizers. While some muscles serve exclusively as stabilizers, many muscles actually perform both functions. It is the larger surface layer muscles of the core and

tension, the effect that is produced is not forward motion as desired but a fishtailing or bobbing movement. Muscles are often categorized as movers and stabilizers. While some muscles serve exclusively as stabilizers, many muscles actually perform both functions. It is the larger surface layer muscles of the core and limbs that can act both as both movers and stabilizers as the body goes through the series of stroke actions that make up swimming. There are several examples of this dual function in swimming. THE TRAPEzIUS The trapezius muscle is the large muscle of the upper back that connects the neck and the shoulders and the back. The trapezius moves and rotates the shoulders and neck, as well as stabilizes the shoulder blades and upper body. In freestyle, the trapezius is engaged as a primary mover during breathing as the head turns for the inhale, and during recovery, as the arm moves back to the beginning of the stroke. It also serves as a stabilizer assisting the swimmer in maintaining 35 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 35 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 38 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming a positive floating position throughout the entire stroke action. When a swimmer presses his or her chest down to achieve the “downhill” floating position, the shoulder blades move closer together. The trapezius is employed in achieving and holding this position. THE OBLIQUES The obliques are bilateral abdominal muscles located at either side of the “six pack.” The function of the obliques is to assist in rotation and sideways stabilization of the body. In freestyle and backstroke, the obliques act in partnership, one as a mover and one as a stabilizer, to produce the pendulum- like roll that provides leverage to the arm stroke. As the swimmer rolls into the stroke, the oblique muscle

assist in rotation and sideways stabilization of the body. In freestyle and backstroke, the obliques act in partnership, one as a mover and one as a stabilizer, to produce the pendulum- like roll that provides leverage to the arm stroke. As the swimmer rolls into the stroke, the oblique muscle on the opposite side acts as the primary moving muscle, while the oblique on the same side works to stabilize the core and hips. As the leading arm changes, so does the function of the obliques. THE DELTOIDS The deltoids are the bilateral muscles that cover the shoulders. The function of the deltoids is to lift and assist with rotation of the arm. In butterfly, freestyle and backstroke, where the arm recovers out of the water, the deltoids act as primary movers to lift and return the arm to the beginning of the stroke. However, during the power phase of the stroke, the deltoids serve as stabilizers to the shoulder as the arm sweeps through the three-dimensional path of the underwater stroke. 36 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 36 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 39 Text --- The Swimming Muscles THE QUADRICEPS The quadriceps are the large and powerful four-part muscles located in the front of the thigh. The function of the quads is to straighten the leg from the hip to the knee and to provide stability to the lower body and knee. In flutter and dolphin kick, the quads are the primary movers as they drive the legs downward for the powerful downbeat of the kick. However, during the upbeat, they serve as knee stabilizers, keeping it from hyper-extending. Strength training should address both moving and stabilizing. Because the stabilizing effect is more subtle, often strength-building efforts focus on the moving function and ignore the stabilizing function. The importance of self-

powerful downbeat of the kick. However, during the upbeat, they serve as knee stabilizers, keeping it from hyper-extending. Strength training should address both moving and stabilizing. Because the stabilizing effect is more subtle, often strength-building efforts focus on the moving function and ignore the stabilizing function. The importance of self- stabilization in swimming cannot be emphasized enough. We must understand that moving and stabilizing work in partnership. Efficient movement in the water cannot work without both. Therefore strength for moving and strength for stabilizing must be developed in a balanced manner. 37 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 37 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 40 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming WHAT CONNECTS EVERYTHING The most obvious muscles used in swimming are in the arms and legs. A quick look at any swimmer in motion shows us that our four limbs are constantly moving. Although it might appear that the arms and legs are our primary movers, in fact, they account for just a small part of a swimmer’s propulsion. What connects the four limbs in integrated motion is the core of the body. Like a ceiling fan, with its blades turning, what joins the action of the blades, determines their speed, and generates their power is the motor in the middle. By generating swimming movements from the motor in the middle – the core –, a swimmer employs the largest muscles to initiate the action and then is able to transfer that motion up to the arms and down to the legs. The relatively smaller muscles of the limbs may ultimately apply the resistance, but the larger muscles of the core are able to produce more force and power, allowing a faster tempo to be created and sustained. The muscles of the core, both in the front and the back of the

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
The relatively smaller muscles of the limbs may ultimately apply the resistance, but the larger muscles of the core are able to produce more force and power, allowing a faster tempo to be created and sustained. The muscles of the core, both in the front and the back of the body, are also our primary stabilizers. As the connectors between the upper and lower limbs, the tension held in these muscles is central to producing efficient and coordinated stroke action. Without core tension, we would not be able to achieve a unified stroke, produce leverage, or maintain balance and alignment throughout the changing positions of the stroke. 38 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 38 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 41 Text --- The Swimming Muscles TAKE A SWIMMING LESSON FROM A SEAL Part of the Pinniped order (from the Latin meaning “wing foot”), we have to look in awe at seals, who are not only among the fastest aquatic mammals but are also the most efficient swimmers. Moving through the water at speeds up to 25 miles per hour (about the same speed as dolphins and whales), seals are at the top of the list in terms of least energy cost associated with producing speed. It seems that seals have perfected swimming. Like humans, seals are air-breathing mammals, and like us, they have four limbs. However, over millions of years, these descendents of bears have adapted to using aquatic locomotion so well that we should stop and pay attention. Watching the seal swimming at high speed, we see that it holds its front limbs flat against the sides of its body and uses a narrow, undulating motion that starts at the head and moves down through its body. This wave action is based on movement and stabilization of the seal’s spine by the

at high speed, we see that it holds its front limbs flat against the sides of its body and uses a narrow, undulating motion that starts at the head and moves down through its body. This wave action is based on movement and stabilization of the seal’s spine by the muscles that surround it. It is a swimming technique that de-emphasizes the limbs for producing speed in the water. In fact, the seal uses its front limbs for steering rather than propulsion. In addition, the evolution of the seal’s rear limbs has led them to be fused into one great limb down to the ankles, creating in essence an extension of the seal’s body. By using the muscles of its powerful trunk to produce and control movement, the seal has achieved a “limbless” swimming style that, in comparative studies, has recorded it swimming a distance of one mile more than six times faster than the fastest human swimmer, with five times less effort! In the absence of evolutionary adaptations such as webbed toes and a streamlined body shape that would make the human form more seal-like, we can learn a lot about swimming from this creature and work toward achieving a more seal-like technique that utilizes the muscles of our core to generate more efficiency and swimming speed. 39 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 39 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 42 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming The muscles of the core are crucial to the overall effectiveness of swimming.

should be a main priority of any strength training program for swimmers. Strengthening the core involves targeting a series of muscles that work together to create a better foundation to swim from. These muscles are listed below. FRONT CORE MUSCLES The front core muscles include the abdominals, most visibly the rectus abdominus, commonly known as the “six-pack,” which allows forward and backward bending, and provides stability to the core, especially in the horizontal position. Located at either side of the rectus abdominus are the obliques, which assist and stabilize rotation, an important action in long axis strokes. Finally, the major muscles of the chest are the pectoralis major, which are important movers of the arm, especially during the catch and in the beginning of the power phase of all strokes. They also act as stabilizers to the shoulders. Just below the pectoralis major are the serratus anterior, named for their serrated appearance as they cover a portion of the first eight ribs. The function of these muscles is to help raise the shoulder blades, and stabilize the frontal and overhead motions that we use in swimming.

highly developed by swimming. The lats run bilaterally over the length of the back, from under each arm to the waist, and wrap around the swimmer’s sides. The trapezius muscle connects the neck to the shoulders and back. It enables a variety of movements including raising and lowering the arm, rotation, turning the head and lifting the shoulders, as well as stabilizing these actions. This is a crucial muscle to maintain as it affects posture and shoulder position. The rhomboids, which are located in the upper back underneath the trapezius, assist in pulling and posture by moving the shoulder blades closer together. Also under the surface layer of muscles in the upper back are the teres major and teres minor muscles. Teres major assists in pulling the shoulders back and rotating the arms outwardly. Teres minor are part of a group of shoulder stabilizing muscles called the rotator cuff. They stabilize internal rotation of the arm. Trapezius Rhomboids Teres Minor Latisimus Dorsi Teres Major 41 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 41 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 44 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming UNDER THE SURFACE The human body is wrapped with several layers of muscles. It is tempting to target solely the muscles we see, and while these surface-layer muscles are key to producing forward motion in swimming, what lies underneath them is equally important. The function of the underlying muscles is largely to provide stability to the bones at the joints. In swimming, the joints that get the most use are located in the shoulders. In swimming, we reach, extend and align with our shoulders, use them to apply resistance to the water on multiple planes, and we use them to throw our arms forward to do it all over again. While the extraordinary shoulder enables all of these motions,

are located in the shoulders. In swimming, we reach, extend and align with our shoulders, use them to apply resistance to the water on multiple planes, and we use them to throw our arms forward to do it all over again. While the extraordinary shoulder enables all of these motions, swimming puts a lot of demand on them. Therefore, taking care of our shoulders should be a priority. Just like a race car designed to perform, to ensure that it is ready to work at an optimal level, regular maintenance of its systems is key. Likewise, our shoulders are so crucial to swimming that maintaining them is just as important. We must both understand their parts and attend to their mechanisms. Shoulder maintenance should be considered a regular part of a strength training program. We must strengthen them from the inside out. The shoulder has two joints. The first, commonly known as the shoulder joint, lies under the visible deltoid muscle. This joint allows the extensive rotation of the arm that is so basic to swimming. It is a ball and socket type joint, located where the top of the arm bone meets the shoulder blade. Resembling a golf tee, the end of the arm bone sits on top of a shallow socket in the shoulder blade. The remarkable range of motion allowed by this joint ironically makes it vulnerable to instability. The “ball” is held in place on the “tee” directly by four small muscles that surround the joint, stabilizing it during motion. These muscles together are called the rotator cuff. 42 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 42 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 45 Text --- The Swimming Muscles ROTATOR CUFF The four muscles of the rotator cuff each have different functions: Supraspinatus — stabilizes movement of the arm up and away

stabilizing it during motion. These muscles together are called the rotator cuff. 42 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 42 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 45 Text --- The Swimming Muscles ROTATOR CUFF The four muscles of the rotator cuff each have different functions: Supraspinatus — stabilizes movement of the arm up and away from the body Subscapularis — stabilizes internal arm rotation Infraspinatus — stabilizes external arm rotation Teres minor — stabilizes internal arm rotation and lifting of the arm When one or more of the rotator cuff muscles is weak, damaged, or develops unevenly, the bones are not held stable and can move around in the joint, leading to inflammation of the surrounding tissues and shoulder pain. In swimmers, poor stroke technique, overuse, or other muscular imbalances can all contribute to rotator cuff problems. But even when these factors are identified and corrected, it is necessary to strengthen the rotator cuff muscles before the shoulder joint can regain stability and perform correctly. SCAPULAE REGION The second joint of the shoulder is located at the intersection of the clavicle, commonly known as the collarbone, and the top of the scapulae, commonly known as the shoulder blade. This joint performs like a hinge for the shoulder blade. The shoulder blade enables the overhead motions we use in every swimming stroke. Like the shoulder joint, the job of the shoulder blade is to allow extensive motion. To facilitate this, it is held in place only by the muscles, in contrast to most other joints in the body, which also have tendons and ligaments to support them. When a swimmer has poor posture, weak back muscles or overly developed chest muscles, the shoulder blades can move out of place. The unstable shoulder blade slides upward, tipping out from the back at the lower edge of the

the body, which also have tendons and ligaments to support them. When a swimmer has poor posture, weak back muscles or overly developed chest muscles, the shoulder blades can move out of place. The unstable shoulder blade slides upward, tipping out from the back at the lower edge of the bone and tipping into the adjacent structures at the top of the bone. In some swimmers, this condition is visible when looking at the back. 43 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 43 12.07.11 12:12 --- OCR from Page 45 Image 1 --- Supraspinatous Muscle Clavicle Humerus Subscapularis Scapula FRONT VIEW Supraspinatous Muscle Clavicle Humerus Infraspinatous Muscle Teres Minor Muscle BACK VIEW --- Page 46 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming One or both of the shoulder blades stick out, away from the body (like wings) and appear to be higher that usual. When the joint continues to do its job, including repeated swimming motions from this wrong position, it can affect the rotator cuff muscles, causing pain. While the rotator cuff is the site of the pain, the cause is instability of the shoulder blade. Although most swimmers with shoulder pain are diagnosed with rotator cuff problems, many physical therapists agree that the primary and underlying cause of all shoulder problems in swimmers is instability of the shoulder blade. Ongoing work to strengthen the muscles that stabilize the shoulder blade should therefore be a priority. By strengthening the stabilizing muscles that support both shoulder joints, a swimmer can prevent the most common swimming-related health problems. If a swimmer’s shoulder does become painful, rest, as well as targeted strengthening exercises of the shoulder stabilizers, should be part of the recovery process. 44 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 44 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 47 Text --- The Swimming Muscles KEY MUSCLES FOR CERTAIN STROKES We

If a swimmer’s shoulder does become painful, rest, as well as targeted strengthening exercises of the shoulder stabilizers, should be part of the recovery process. 44 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 44 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 47 Text --- The Swimming Muscles KEY MUSCLES FOR CERTAIN STROKES We want to think in terms of multi-muscle swimming movements as much as possible, however because the pull pattern, kicking action, leverage and balance requirements in each of the four competitive swimming strokes is unique, we must consider which muscles are especially important to each stroke. BUTTERFLY The wide bilateral recovery of the butterfly places a demand on the trapezius unlike any other stroke. In addition, the initial movements of the power phase are done when the swimmer’s body is lower than the chest, requiring the pectoralis major to engage in a distinct lifting action. Finally, as the dolphin kick places the hips in a higher position relative to the body than in other strokes, the gluteus maximus comes into play. Key Butterfly Muscles 45 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 45 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 48 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming BACKSTROKE To achieve the ideal body position in backstroke, the pelvis must be tilted Key Backstroke Muscles forward through abdominal contraction of the retus abdominus. The upward kick, against gravity also puts a large demand on the quads. The unique catch position, behind the head requires the rhomboids to contract heavily. Finally, the elongated push portion of the arm stroke engages the triceps more completely, and for a longer duration than in other strokes.

BREASTSTROKE The unique requirements of the breaststroke kick engage several muscles that are not otherwise used much in swimming. While the hamstrings are used to raise the heels, the hip flexors and abductors perform and stabilize the sweeping motion of the kick. As the foot position goes from completely feet flexed to completely pointed, the calf muscles are also heavily engaged. The abbreviated breaststroke arm stroke employs the biceps more so than the other strokes during the in-sweep of the Key Breaststroke Muscles 46 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 46 12.07.11 12:12 --- OCR from Page 48 Image 2 --- Key Backstroke Muscles --- OCR from Page 48 Image 4 --- Key Breaststroke Muscles --- Page 49 Text --- The Swimming Muscles stroke. Finally, the breaststroke’s underwater recovery employs the upper trapezius to shrug and roll the shoulders forward as the arms return to the extended position. FREESTYLE The three-dimensional sweeping pull pattern of the freestyle taxes the shoulders more than any other stroke. Rotator cuff muscles and muscles of the scapular region work overtime to stabilize the shoulders in freestyle, as the arms rotate from a high elbow position to the rear of the body during recovery to an extended position in front of the body during the power phase. Finally, the obliques serve as primary movers in freestyle to produce the corkscrew effect that sends power from the core to the upper and lower limbs.

It involves the growth and maturing of every body system. It happens in its own time. Although we may contribute to physical development through good nutrition and healthy living, and we may even exert some control on heightening performance through training, we cannot hurry the actual process of development. While some have tried to influence this process with growth hormones and other drugs, the rewards are very short-lived, and the consequences are great and enduring as the body rebels by becoming sick, injured or shutting down, unable to support artificially accelerated development. Gradual, natural development allows the systems of the body to physically support each other as they grow. The skeleton of a child cannot support the muscles of an adult, but as the child’s bones grow, larger muscles and more strength are possible. Gradual development also allows time for important connections to be established between the brain and the body. As we develop, our simple actions evolve into more complex actions over time. Initial, awkward movements become coordinated and seamless. While people develop at different rates, there is a predictable progression of development that occurs in stages over a lifetime. When designing a strength training program, the stage of development is an important consideration. Strength training encompasses a wide variety of activities, which meet a wide variety of objectives. For every stage, there are particular developmental milestones that should correspond to strength training objectives. As the stage of development changes, strength training objectives must change, too. The content of a

is an important consideration. Strength training encompasses a wide variety of activities, which meet a wide variety of objectives. For every stage, there are particular developmental milestones that should correspond to strength training objectives. As the stage of development changes, strength training objectives must change, too. The content of a strength program should complement the swimmer’s abilities at their particular stage and not impose demands that the swimmer is not ready for. A strength training program designed with objectives and activities that fit a swimmer’s stage of development will encourage faster swimming at each stage of development and over a swimmer’s career. 49 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 49 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 52 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming AT WHAT AGE SHOULD STRENGTH TRAINING BEGIN? The answer to this question is not as simple as how many birthdays a swimmer has had. In fact, there is little benefit to using chronological age as the measure for beginning a strength training program. Chronological age does not tell us much. There are 10-year-olds who are 5’6” and could be mistaken physically for 16-year-olds, and others who are 4’0” tall and could be mistaken for 7-year-olds. Chronological age also does not address swimming experience. Is the swimmer starting competitive swimming as a teenager, or have they been in the sport consistently since before Kindergarten? Once again, we return to the swimmer’s athletic base. A swimmer of any age who does not have an adequate athletic base must be trained as a beginner, although with more physical development, he or she can sometimes advance more quickly than a young beginner. Rather than chronological age, a more meaningful measure to use is physiological age. Physiological age, or the stage of physical development of a swimmer, provides a better picture of what kind of strength

although with more physical development, he or she can sometimes advance more quickly than a young beginner. Rather than chronological age, a more meaningful measure to use is physiological age. Physiological age, or the stage of physical development of a swimmer, provides a better picture of what kind of strength training the swimmer is ready for and can benefit from. 50 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 50 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 53 Text --- Stages of Development So, at what age should swimmers begin strength training? From day one, but the content of the strength training program must be carefully designed for the appropriate level of physical development and swimming experience. SPECIFIC WORK FOR SPECIFIC STAGES We will assign the following categories to the various stages of physical development for the purpose of identifying strength training objective, describing appropriate activities, and suggesting the frequency and duration of strength training sessions. Older beginners should start with the same activities as the first stage listed: • Elementary • Pre-adolescence • Adolescence • Young Adult • Adult • Senior 51 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 51 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 54 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming ELEMENTARY At this stage, the child’s head is proportionally large, and hands and feet are small, leading to some balance issues. The upper body and arm muscles are also generally less developed than lower body and leg muscles. Some children have big bellies, which should be evaluated before labeling the child as overweight. Often a large belly is the result of a growth-related posture imbalance in which the spine curves toward the belly. It is a condition that is usually soon outgrown. Children at this stage have an immense amount of energy but limited coordination and very little endurance. The objective of strength training at this stage of development

result of a growth-related posture imbalance in which the spine curves toward the belly. It is a condition that is usually soon outgrown. Children at this stage have an immense amount of energy but limited coordination and very little endurance. The objective of strength training at this stage of development is to build a solid athletic base. Appropriate strength training sessions three to five days a week, for about 15 minutes, should include activities that promote the five areas of general athleticism – using the child’s own resistance only – in short periods of work followed by periods of rest. This work should be fun in order to hold the characteristic short attention span of young children as long as possible. PRE-ADOLESCENCE Children at this stage of development experience rapid growth in both height and weight. Often the child has spurts where he or she grows lengthwise and then widthwise, leading to periods of awkwardness. Ultimately, the trunk and limbs lengthen and more strength is possible. Stamina also increases and coordination steadily develops. Balance eventually improves. The objective of strength training at this stage of development is to improve stability, coordination, and to build 52 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 52 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 55 Text --- Stages of Development THE EARLY DEVELOPER AND THE LATE BLOOMER At age 11, Peter was a dedicated member of the swim team who diligently swam five days a week, focusing on good technique and making every interval. He also participated in strength and quickness drills led by his coach three times a week. Peter’s work ethic was so admirable that he was given a trophy at the team’s annual awards banquet. Peter attended swim meets regularly, holding clearly in his mind the goal of swimming faster than ever before. One day, after placing fifth

of the water, developing a well-defined six pack that he was proud of. Eventually, Allen decided to trade in his jammers for a soccer ball. Peter kept whittling away slowly and patiently at his times in competition and, after advancing to the 13-14 division, he adopted the 100 fly as his new favorite. At the first meet of spring, Peter stepped up on the blocks, seeded tenth in the fly. He swam the first 50 with ease and precision but felt uneasy when he found himself with more energy than usual going in the last lap. Intent on giving the race his best, he put his head down and accelerated his stroke tempo. When the final wall came, Peter looked up and was shocked to see he had won the race, erasing nine full seconds from his previous best time. As he emerged from the pool, he heard a familiar voice. “I told you!” the coach said. Peter grinned widely. It was only then that he observed that he was not looking up at his coach, but looking at him eye to eye. He realized at that moment that his patience had paid off, and it was finally his turn to shine. 53 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 53 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 56 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming power. Appropriate strength training activities for this stage of development include exercises that address core stability balance and tempo, using the child’s own resistance only. This is a good stage to start focusing on perfecting form that will carry through to later stages of development. Such work can be done three to four days a week in sessions of about 20 minutes.

start focusing on perfecting form that will carry through to later stages of development. Such work can be done three to four days a week in sessions of about 20 minutes. ADOLESCENCE During adolescence, athletes go through a time of continuous change that includes physical maturing and weight gain. As they go through puberty, athletes experience periods of rapid strength gain alternating with periods where strength lags behind their growth. At times, their physical changes are accompanied by awkwardness and self- consciousness. At other times, they are accompanied by bravado and testing of their new characteristics. The objective at this stage of development is building power, force, stability, and coordination. When well supervised, swimmers can make important progress during this time, with gains in applicable strength. Sessions of 30 minutes or more, five days a week should include self-resistance work, medicine balls and some stretch bands, accompanied by clearly stated objectives. This combination of training can encourage swimmers to focus on achieving great improvements in swimming speed. YOUNG ADULT At this stage, the athlete has adult physical characteristics and size. This is a period when the athlete is at the peak of strength and performance potential. With a solid foundation of athleticism, swimming and strength work, the now fully mature swimmer can make huge and continuing gains in speed with dedication to a solid training routine and a healthy lifestyle. 54 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 54 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 57 Text --- Stages of Development The objective at this stage is maximizing force, power, and explosiveness. A strength program that encompasses weight training, stretch bands, medicine balls and self-resistance can encourage development of maximum strength by the athlete’s adult body that can be applied to swimming faster than ever before.

is maximizing force, power, and explosiveness. A strength program that encompasses weight training, stretch bands, medicine balls and self-resistance can encourage development of maximum strength by the athlete’s adult body that can be applied to swimming faster than ever before. A program of strength work four days a week for an hour can net the force, power, explosiveness, and stability results of a lifetime. ADULT During this stage, a very gradual decline of muscle size and strength is expected. The shape of the body changes subtly over time, frequently expanding at the waistline. With the obligations of “real life,” the adult athlete faces less training time and, in general, a less active lifestyle. For the adult athlete, the objective is maintenance. Holding on to physical fitness is certainly a challenge. As the years go by, maintenance should be viewed as improvement! With an ongoing routine of frequent swimming and strength work, it is possible for a swimmer to maintain his or her speed into the 40s and 50s. 55 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 55 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 58 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming A routine that includes strength training for an hour encompassing weights, stretch bands, medicine balls and self-resistance for three days a week will provide such maintenance. At this stage, it is important to make time for two days of solid rest as recovery just takes longer. SENIOR In the golden years, decline in the size and strength of muscles is evident, which sometimes contributes to balance and mobility problems. In addition, seniors can face bone strength and flexibility issues affecting posture and range of motion. Still, the senior who stays active and strong will be in a much better position to make the most of his or her ability to move freely through the water.

balance and mobility problems. In addition, seniors can face bone strength and flexibility issues affecting posture and range of motion. Still, the senior who stays active and strong will be in a much better position to make the most of his or her ability to move freely through the water. At this stage of development, the objective is flexibility and weight- bearing activity. Strength training is an essential part of a swimmer’s training routine. A program that includes conservative weights, stretch cords, and medicine balls, as well as self-resistance, two to three days a week for 30 minutes or more can produce bone density improvements, slow muscle decline, and along with the typical benefits of swimming, contribute to a better quality of life. 56 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 56 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 59 Text --- Stages of Development JUST KEEP SWIMMING Joy was a dedicated mother.

Still, shortly thereafter, when they moved out on their own, she felt empty inside. A divorced 48-year-old, Joy looked at herself in the mirror and asked, “Who am I?” Her empty house and the new availability of time took quite a while to adjust to, but one day, Joy woke up with an idea. One of the good examples she had provided for her children was to maintain a regular physical fitness routine throughout their childhood. An active competitive swimmer in her youth, Joy had chosen swimming as her fitness activity, going to the pool twice a week before daylight for an hour or

to enter a competition for adult swimmers. With anticipation, but no expectations, she arrived at the event and was pleased that she, by no means, was the oldest swimmer present. Elated by the camaraderie and positive atmosphere she encountered, she swam to a second place finish in the 200 backstroke. The winner, a woman of at least 80, congratulated her as she climbed easily out of the pool. “Maybe, I’ll see you at the next meet,” Joy responded. “Yes, you will,” the woman asserted. “Until then, just keep swimming.” 57 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 57 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 60 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming 58 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 58 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 61 Text --- Let’s Get Specific 5 LET’S GET SPECIFIC TYPES OF STRENGTH TRAINING THAT BENEFIT SWIMMING This section introduces five kinds of strength training that benefit swimming in terms of building strength that is useable in the water. Under each of the five types of activity, specific exercises are listed. Each exercise has been selected for its transferability to swimming in terms of directionality, tempo and multi-muscle engagement. Each exercise is described, illustrated, and categorized by the area of the body it primarily targets. It is important to remember that although an exercise is described as targeting a particular area of the body, multiple muscles are involved, both in the target area, as well as in other areas of the body. For instance, exercises that target the upper body and arms usually involve the core as well. While all strength training is based on resistance, each type of exercise presented provides a different kind of challenge to the muscles. Some types are appropriate for all swimmers, but some are appropriate only at more advanced stages of development and are noted as such. SELF-RESISTANCE Self-resistance

core as well. While all strength training is based on resistance, each type of exercise presented provides a different kind of challenge to the muscles. Some types are appropriate for all swimmers, but some are appropriate only at more advanced stages of development and are noted as such. SELF-RESISTANCE Self-resistance refers to using the weight of one’s own body as the load. “Baby stuff!” you might say; far from it. Some of the most beneficial and challenging exercises for swimmers of all levels fall under this category. Self- resistance work, in fact, should be a part of all strength training programs, 59 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 59 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 62 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming as it resembles swimming very closely in terms of multi-muscle movements. Self-resistance work promotes core stability and balance, coordination and tempo. In addition, force, power, and explosiveness can all be developed very successfully with self-resistance work. Beneficial self-resistance activities include: FULL BODY Burpies — Stand, squat, extend legs, squat and stand. Repeat the sequence. Cartwheels — A gymnastics handspring where the body turns over sideways and back to the standing position with the arm and legs spread like the spokes of a cartwheel. Crab Walk — Walk on all four limbs with the back toward the ground. Crawling — Walk on hands and feet. 60 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 60 12.07.11 12:12 --- OCR from Page 62 Image 1 --- al --- OCR from Page 62 Image 2 --- ANI --- Page 63 Text --- Let’s Get Specific Speed Walking — As in the Olympic sport, a rapid heel to toe walking stride using leverage from the arms and core.

The traditional push-up, a mainstay of modern exercise and a standard measure of fitness level, does not appear among these recommended self- resistance exercises intentionally. Although countless push-ups are done regularly by pro-athletes, military recruits, and even Rocky, as part of their physical training routines, it is the belief of this coach that the push-up should not be part of a swimming strength training program. The push-up does not address swimming very well. It does not simulate swimming motion at all, as the direction of the resistance is perpendicular to the athlete’s body, rather than parallel. While the push-up does promote core and upper body strength, it also taxes the shoulders in ways that do not benefit swimming. Extensive push-ups can develop muscles that interfere with

simulate swimming motion at all, as the direction of the resistance is perpendicular to the athlete’s body, rather than parallel. While the push-up does promote core and upper body strength, it also taxes the shoulders in ways that do not benefit swimming. Extensive push-ups can develop muscles that interfere with a swimmer’s range of motion in the water, especially during arm extension. Further, the push-up shortens shoulder stabilizers and chest muscles where they already tend to be too short among swimmers. Activities that are less problematic for swimmers, that promote swimming- specific core and upper body strength better than the push-up, include the plank, side plank and corner push out. 69 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 69 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 72 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming SELF-RESISTANCE WITH ACCESSORIES Small accessories can be included to add complexity or challenge to self- resistance work. Accessories include balls, jump ropes, hula hoops, cones, rope, and balance balls. Self-resistance work can also take advantage of landscape features, including sand, stairs, bleachers and hills. Playground and gymnastic equipment, including bars, rings, nets and pegboards, may also be used. Close supervision should always be maintained. Good “accessorized” self-resistance work includes: FULL BODY Net Climbing — Use the arms and legs to ascend a net made of rope. 70 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 70 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 73 Text --- Let’s Get Specific Rope Climbing — Use the arms and legs to ascend a rope.

training work. The medicine ball provides a compact external load in useful weights from 1 to 25 pounds. Even with this minor amount of added resistance, medicine balls are not recommended for swimmers in the earliest stages of development for two reasons. First, they are weights, and the bones of young athletes are not physically ready to support more than their own body weight. Second, although medicine balls may look like toys, and in many ways act like a regular ball (they can be tossed, rolled and caught), they must be handled as tools. They are heavy and, if dropped on a foot or thrown at someone’s face, they can cause injury. Medicine balls should be used only by athletes with the maturity to handle them carefully. There are many benefits of medicine ball training. It allows the swimmer to move through multiple planes, which simulates the movement used in swimming, unlike traditional weightlifting, which is done in a single plane. Medicine ball activities encourage the swimmer to develop both moving and stabilizing functions evenly as he or she must exert effort to move the ball and stabilize to control the ball. Medicine ball training also helps develop force and explosiveness very well, as the swimmer must react quickly to the weight of the ball when it comes toward him and when he sends it into flight. Finally, medicine ball training encourages coordination by using multi- muscle movements rather than isolated muscle efforts. Medicine balls can be used by an individual and, in some cases, with a partner. Beneficial activities for swimmers include: 77 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 77 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 80 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming FULL BODY Squat and Jump — Hold the ball with two hands at about the belly button level, squat, then

Stretch cords are simply lengths of surgical tubing with loops or handles for each hand. When secured in the middle to a stationary pole, the stretch cord enables the swimmer to simulate the entire range of motion that makes up the power phase of the stroke against resistance. Stretch cords also require the use of an accelerating motion to accomplish the action successfully, exactly like swimming. The motion is repeated with a controlled reverse action or recovery between each exertion. The swimmer can use a tempo equal to his or her swimming tempo against resistance or practice an “ideal” higher tempo. Stretch cords also promote core stabilization, as the swimmer must maintain constant tension in

swimming. The motion is repeated with a controlled reverse action or recovery between each exertion. The swimmer can use a tempo equal to his or her swimming tempo against resistance or practice an “ideal” higher tempo. Stretch cords also promote core stabilization, as the swimmer must maintain constant tension in the body from the standing position, bent forward at the waist, while the arms are moving. Stretch cords are available in a variety of thicknesses, which determine their resistance. Because too much resistance will make proper technique impossible, it is important to start with a stretch band that has less resistance and work up to more resistance when good technique is maintained. The following stretch cord exercises are highly recommended: 82 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 82 12.07.11 12:12 --- Page 85 Text --- Let’s Get Specific FULL BODY Double Arm Pull — Standing and bent forward at the waist, hold the stretch cord in both hands and perform the underwater path of butterfly, accelerating throughout.

Additional beneficial exercise machines for swimmers include: Swim Bench — Replicates swimming motion, including accelerating movement, and encourages correct technique against more resistance than the water provides. It also encourages the swimmer to accelerate move- ments throughout each exertion. Erg — Also known as the rowing machine, the erg builds force and power very well, closely replicating the full-body requirements of rowing, which in many ways are similar to swimming. 87 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 87 12.07.11 12:12 --- OCR from Page 89 Image 2 --- ay) --- Page 90 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming WEIGHTS Weightlifting is recommended only for athletes who have reached the young adult stage of development.

recommended only for athletes who have reached the young adult stage of development. Real consequences can occur when weights are used too early in a swimmer’s development. It is not a myth! Growth plates in young developing swimmers can be damaged under the load of weights. When a swimmer is physically ready for weights, they provide an efficient way to build muscle strength. Weight rooms are full of equipment and machines, some which address swimming and some that don’t. It is important to remember that we are trying to simulate swimming movement, directionality and tempo as much as possible. WEIGHT MACHINES Weight machines that use pulley systems generally address swimming movement in terms of directionality, range of motion, and by requiring accelerating movements. There are also machines that work on lever systems. Some of these are beneficial to swimmers. Some, however, apply resistance in the reverse direction of swimming, and others are designed to isolate muscles rather than to engage multi-muscle movements. Weight machines that are especially beneficial to swimmers include: 88 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 88 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 91 Text --- Let’s Get Specific UPPER BODY/ARMS Lat Pull — This machine has a wide bar suspended overhead from a cable and a pulley that attaches to an adjustable stack of weights at the other end below.

Cable Pull — This machine has a bar attached to cables and pulleys that attach to an adjustable stack of weights. Many exercises can be performed on this machine, but two simulate swimming best. The first is done by standing facing the machine, holding the bar with the arms extended overhead, then doing a double arm freestyle underwater pull. The second is done lying on the back on a bench in front of the machine, holding the bar with the arms extended overhead, then a double arm freestyle underwater pull. In both cases, recover along the same path and repeat. 89 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 89 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 92 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Triceps Press — This machine has a narrow bar suspended overhead from a cable and a pulley that attaches to an adjustable stack of weights at the other end below.

These include hand-held dumbbells, barbells and bars. Work with free weights can be useful as it requires the swimmer to stabilize the weight while exerting. However, many free weight exercises do not address swimming motion as the resistance applied is in the reverse direction of swimming. Free weight activities for swimmers should be carefully evaluated in terms of objective and be included as a primary activity only if they simulate swimming motion. Free weight activities that are especially beneficial to swimmers include: FULL BODY March — Stand holding a dumbbell in each hand at your sides.

Fundamental principles represent the foundation from which you can structure a program that will have predictable and positive results. HOW MUCH AND HOW MANY? These are very important questions when it comes to strength training. We must clearly understand the significance of how much resistance, how many repetitions, at what rate, and how much frequency and duration is necessary in relation to our strength training objectives. Without this knowledge, we could end up with a different outcome than intended. More quantity does not always translate to more strength. Knowing “how much” and “how many” is as important as knowing which exercises to do. HOW MUCH RESISTANCE? With self-resistance work, the load that is resisted is exclusively the swimmer’s body weight, but when external load is added, as with stretch cords, medicine balls and weights, the question of how much resistance needs to be answered. In general, to build power,

which exercises to do. HOW MUCH RESISTANCE? With self-resistance work, the load that is resisted is exclusively the swimmer’s body weight, but when external load is added, as with stretch cords, medicine balls and weights, the question of how much resistance needs to be answered. In general, to build power, the athlete should be able to repeat the exercise with a load 12 to 15 times without failure. If he or she cannot do this, the load is too much. If it is extremely easy, the load is too little. In contrast, to build force, a larger load should be used. The athlete should be able to repeat an exercise only about three to five times. Again, if he or she cannot do this, the load is too much. If it is extremely easy, the load is too little. HOW MANY REPETITIONS? We also need to know how many times to repeat a particular action or sequence. We count repetitions, or reps, and we count sets. A rep is a single action of the exercise. Use the guidelines described above for reps. A set is a group of reps. Multiple sets have rest between them. As far as how many 97 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 97 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 100 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming sets to do, when the objective is force or explosiveness, fewer sets are done, and sometimes, only a single set is performed. When the objective is power or endurance, more sets are done. Most people do three to five sets when training for power. HOW MUCH RATE? How fast or slowly an exercise is repeated also is determined by the strength training objective. An exercise done at a faster rate tends to build force and explosiveness. An exercise done at slower rate tends

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
Most people do three to five sets when training for power. HOW MUCH RATE? How fast or slowly an exercise is repeated also is determined by the strength training objective. An exercise done at a faster rate tends to build force and explosiveness. An exercise done at slower rate tends to build power. With some exercises, it is possible to simulate swimming tempo very well by allowing the athlete to perform repetitions at a rate of about one per second. Stretch cord work is a good example of this. Some exercises are not designed for stroke tempo work, so do not attempt to achieve such a tempo. The Lat Pull is a good example of an exercise that should not be used for tempo work as it is very important not to rush the recovery, but to control it instead. HOW RESISTANCE, REPETITIONS AND RATE WORK TOGETHER To get the intended outcome, we look at the amount of resistance, or load, the number of repetitions and sets, and the rate that the exercise is performed together. For instance, if our objective is to develop force, we must pair fewer repetitions and sets with more load. If we try to build force by increasing both the number of repetitions and the load at the same time, the swimmer will soon experience failure, and the objective will not be met. In contrast, if our objective is to develop power, we must pair more repetitions and sets with less resistance. If we try to build power by increasing both the number of repetitions and the load at the same time, the swimmer will soon experience failure, and the objective will not be met. HOW MUCH FREQUENCY AND DURATION? Frequency refers to the number of strength training sessions in a week, month or season.

### STRENGTH TRAINING FOR FASTER SWIMMING_full_text.txt
to build power by increasing both the number of repetitions and the load at the same time, the swimmer will soon experience failure, and the objective will not be met. HOW MUCH FREQUENCY AND DURATION? Frequency refers to the number of strength training sessions in a week, month or season. Duration refers to how long each session is. Frequency should be determined by the swimmer’s stage of development in conjunction with the strength training content. For instance, a program using weights, for developmentally advanced swimmers should accommodate rest and recovery time between sessions. A program for beginners, however, that is based on a good variety of self-resistance activities can be done several days in a row in order to develop a good athletic base. Swimmers in the adult or senior stages of development should build in more rest days, as recovery takes longer. 98 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 98 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 101 Text --- The Fundamentals BEFORE OR AFTER SWIMMING? When is the best time to do strength training, before or after swimming? The debate is ongoing. On the one hand, it is clear that strength training before swimming activates the muscles that will be used in the pool. Swimming-specific strength training before swimming also reinforces good form in the water. Studies have shown that the nervous system connections established and practiced on land carry over to stroke actions in the pool when swimming directly follows land activities. Finally, many believe that swimmers who swim regularly after a strength training develop better endurance, as swimming, which builds endurance very well, becomes an extension of a “super workout” begun on land, requiring the swimmer to adapt to a greater workload. On the other hand, some believe that since swimming elongates the muscles, strength work that follows swimming ensures that the

training develop better endurance, as swimming, which builds endurance very well, becomes an extension of a “super workout” begun on land, requiring the swimmer to adapt to a greater workload. On the other hand, some believe that since swimming elongates the muscles, strength work that follows swimming ensures that the swimmer’s muscles are well warmed up and less vulnerable to injury from the demands of land training. They also argue that when strength training follows the water workout, the quality of the swimming is higher because a swimmer who is tired after strength training practices swimming slower, with less force, power and explosiveness, reinforcing undesirable habits. Finally, many take the position that swimming first allows the swimmer to feel and utilize the strength that he or she has adapted to in the water where it counts. So which is best? There are valid arguments for both. From the perspective of preparing a swimmer to race, to be ready to perform under less than ideal conditions, including poor weather, crowded warm-up areas and meet delays, a program that uses a bit of both approaches should be considered. By mixing it up, the swimmer will practice adapting to different situations. Further, changing the order of the training routine from time to time will keep it from becoming boring, as the swimmer will stay challenged to perform under different circumstances. The final decision should be based on what best works for the individual athlete. 99 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 99 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 102 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Scheduling rest time is as important as scheduling workout time.

102 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Scheduling rest time is as important as scheduling workout time. Even routines based solely on self-resistance work should allow at least two days off per week. When the content of the strength work includes external load, at least three rest days are recommended. A routine of alternating work days and rest days works well. Some athletes use a daily schedule, by alternating days for upper body and lower body. Attention should be paid to levels of fatigue when using this model. A schedule of two work days in a row, followed by one rest day has also proven successful. The particular schedule should consider the rest requirements of the individual swimmer, assuming he or she is swimming five to six days a week. The duration of each strength training session should also be determined by a swimmer’s particular stage of development, as well as his or her swimming experience. In the early stages, sessions should be quite short because not a great deal of endurance has been developed. Still, a lot of work can be accomplished in 15 to 30 minutes! As the swimmer matures physically, longer training sessions of an hour or more are beneficial, both because the swimmer is capable of more and because more types of activities, more repetitions, and more sets take more time. Answering these fundamental questions must be done before strength training begins. To achieve more swimming speed, careful analysis of “how much and how many” should be done with the specific objective of the swimmer in mind. 100 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 100 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 103 Text --- The Fundamentals START RIGHT SAFETY Like the “No Diving” sign at the shallow end of the pool, safety rules are there for a reason.

Although you may be lucky diving into shallow water, the consequences are real and grave. When safety rules for conduct and equipment use are in place, observe them with respect. If safety rules are not in place, it is the responsibility of the supervisor to establish them. Supervision is a must, especially when children and inexperienced swimmers are engaged in strength training activities. The supervisor must ensure that safety rules are understood and followed. The supervisor must ensure that each activity is performed correctly and safely by each swimmer. The supervisor must ensure that each activity is appropriate for the swimmer’s stage of development and experience. Everyone engaged in strength training should use a proactive approach to preventing accidents by: Training With a Partner All strength training, especially with weights, should be done with a partner who can spot and assist, and observe technique. Handling Weights Correctly Lift weights from the floor using your legs rather than your back. Weights should never be dropped; hey can break bones. They should also not be left on the floor to trip on. Medicine balls should never be thrown at the face or the groin, only at the chest and when the person is looking. Wearing Shoes Although most swimmers are very comfortable in bare feet around the pool deck, shoes should be mandatory for any strength training activity involving external weight or moving with impact on the feet. While many exercises can be done safely without shoes on the pool deck or gym, it

Wearing Shoes Although most swimmers are very comfortable in bare feet around the pool deck, shoes should be mandatory for any strength training activity involving external weight or moving with impact on the feet. While many exercises can be done safely without shoes on the pool deck or gym, it is never acceptable to be barefoot in the weight room where obstacles are many or when using any exercise machine with moving parts. Self-resistance work that involves running, jumping, or changing directions can put excessive pressure on bare feet. Shoes will provide support as well as protection from sharp objects hidden in grass and rough surfaces. 101 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 101 12.07.11 12:13 --- OCR from Page 103 Image 1 --- NO RUNNING NO DIVING --- Page 104 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming Tying Hair Back Long hair back should be tied back to ensure good visibility at all times and to avoid entanglement in machines. WARM-UP The purpose of warming up before strength training is exactly the same as at the beginning of a swimming workout. Warming up prepares the body to work by loosening up and activating the muscles, and raising the heart rate to circulate oxygen-rich blood to the muscles. Swimmers should spend at least a quarter of their strength training time warming up. Good warm-up activities include: • Relaxed Arm Circles • Hanging Arm Circles • Cherry Pickers • Jumping Jacks • Running • Skipping • Side Steps • Stairs • Skating • Jump Rope 102 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 102 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 105 Text --- The Fundamentals TAKE IT EASY ON THE STRETCHING!

Rope 102 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 102 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 105 Text --- The Fundamentals TAKE IT EASY ON THE STRETCHING! Stretching has long been a traditional part of warming up before exercise, but the fact is, stretching has injured many swimmers. There are two reasons for this: 1. Stretching does not prepare the body to work, as a warm-up should do. By using valuable warm-up time for stretching, a swimmer runs out of time to do activities that raise the heart rate and activate the muscles. Beginning a workout in this state leaves the body more prone to injury. In addition, without a good warm-up, some or all of the workout is wasted because the swimmer is not prepared to exert. 2. In general, swimmers have very mobile joints, so stretching is really unnecessary. This is especially true of shoulder stretching. Because the shoulders are so central to swimming, they are commonly the site of soreness for many swimmers. In an effort to relieve soreness, we turn to stretching. But what happens when these muscles are stretched is that too much looseness develops, which can lead to joint stability problems during swimming, producing more soreness and pain. Instead of stretching as a warm-up, swimmers should spend warm-up time doing full-body activity with gradually progressive effort. As far as the shoulders, rather than stretching, the focus should be on stabilizing mobility at the joints to keep them operating correctly. This is done through specific shoulder stabilization exercises, as shown on page 94-95. If stretching is done at all, it should be done after exercise. It should be very conservative and target only the large muscles, not the joints. Even this kind of stretching should be gentle and gradual. Under no circumstances should any bouncing action be used. Under no circumstances

page 94-95. If stretching is done at all, it should be done after exercise. It should be very conservative and target only the large muscles, not the joints. Even this kind of stretching should be gentle and gradual. Under no circumstances should any bouncing action be used. Under no circumstances should another swimmer apply external stretching pressure for you. Under no circumstances should stretching hurt, either during or after you do it. 103 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 103 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 106 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming When exercise machines are available, warm-ups can include: • Exercise Bike • Elliptical Trainer • Treadmill COOL DOWN Just as after swimming, the cool down is important to let body systems and muscles adjust to the resting state. After exercise, allow several minutes of slow, continuous activity so the heart rate can return to normal and the muscles can begin to relax. One of the best cool down activities is walking. FORM Form is as important in strength training as it is in the water. Form determines the manner in which the swimmer’s body interacts with the resistance. It is important to spend time perfecting the swimmer’s form on any particular exercise before it is repeated over and over. Correct form ensures that the swimmer will use the intended muscles groups in the intended fashion. Incorrect form can lead to poor results, including injury. POSTURE Our symmetrical bodies are designed with many bilateral muscles, including the lats, the obliques, the pectoralis major and the deltoids, among others. However, when one part of our body is out of alignment, the mirror image muscles are very adept at taking over the work. Repeated exercise with poor posture can result in bilateral muscles developing unevenly as one side compensates for the other. As swimming

major and the deltoids, among others. However, when one part of our body is out of alignment, the mirror image muscles are very adept at taking over the work. Repeated exercise with poor posture can result in bilateral muscles developing unevenly as one side compensates for the other. As swimming depends on bilateral strength, maintaining good posture is very important. 104 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 104 12.07.11 12:13 --- Page 107 Text --- The Fundamentals Good posture starts with the awareness of your body position and stance. One of the most positive steps you can take is to develop core strength that stabilizes posture from the front and the back. This will help keep shoulders, hips and knees in alignment, encouraging strength to be developed in a more balanced manner. BREATHING Breathing function is an essential part of athletic performance. Posture plays an important part in good breathing function. Bad posture encumbers breathing capacity by allowing the trunk of the body to be compressed, leaving less room for the lungs to expand and contract. One of the quickest and best ways to improve your breathing during exercise is to stand up straight. Breathing rhythm is very important. Just as we use rhythmic breathing in the pool, it should also be used during strength training. Avoid holding the breath during exertion. Instead, just like swimming, and most all other sports, exhale during exertion and inhale during recovery. Exchanging air properly will keep your muscles better supplied with the oxygen they need to perform. It will also keep you from fatiguing as quickly. CONTROL It is important to control every movement against resistance, both in the power phase and recovery. Always maintain balance and stability during the power phase. Always return to the starting position gently and with less speed. Never allow an

done regularly in terms of load, number of repetitions and sets and rate will allow us to track our progress. The Strength Training Log presented on page 162 provides a basic structure for tracking progress. Make copies and use one sheet per month to record your strength training progress over time. At the beginning of each month, fill in the exercises that you will track on the left side of the page. Then, after each strength training session throughout the month, record your results for those exercises. Record the number of sets, repetitions or other information specific to the exercise for comparison. At the end of the month, do a test set to gauge adaptation. A test set takes three of the exercises you have been doing throughout the month and increases the difficulty of each. The exact way the difficulty is increased depends on the objective. For instance, if your objective is more force, more load would be attempted. If your objective is tempo, more repetitions would be attempted in a fixed time. At the bottom of the Progress Log, a space is provided to record the results of a monthly test set. If test set results show that you are able to perform the exercises with increased difficulty, then as you begin a new month of strength training, use the test set degree of difficulty as your new base. Remember to focus on your objective. If you are training for more force, don’t expect to see much progress in terms of number of repetitions. Look instead for progress in terms of amount of resistance. If you are training for more power, don’t expect to see much progress in terms of the load. Look instead for rate, or number of repetitions. Progress tracked that does not meet the objective,

in terms of number of repetitions. Look instead for progress in terms of amount of resistance. If you are training for more power, don’t expect to see much progress in terms of the load. Look instead for rate, or number of repetitions. Progress tracked that does not meet the objective, should be watched closely over several more weeks. Random progress across the board can be expected, but a trend of progress toward other than the strength objective indicates some change in the training content or routine is needed. 159 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 159 12.07.11 12:14 --- Page 162 Text --- 160 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 160 12.07.11 12:14 --- Page 163 Text --- Conclusion CONCLUSION As you embark on a strength training program with the goal of achieving more swimming speed, please keep this thought in your mind. To become a fast swimmer, you have to be prepared to sow before you reap. Swimming is a sport that takes a lot of dedication over time. Day after day, you have to believe that all your training will pay off. Month after month, you have to have faith that you are developing in the right direction. Year after year, you have to trust that your ultimate swimming goal will be realized. In this age of immediate gratification, swimmers have to be so patient! So, as you catch the next medicine ball, or make your way around the next circuit, take pride in your dedication and enjoy the process of moving toward your goal. 161 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 161 12.07.11 12:14 --- Page 164 Text --- Strength Training for Faster Swimming 162 strengthtraining swimming autorin.indd 162 12.07.11 12:14 --- OCR from Page 164 Image 1 --- 13S LS3.1 ATHLNOW SED Many anqoalag asaxS Hi lols =|) oo) + a. o TIVWe SNIOIGIW oo

This isn’t all that surprising. We tend to think that it’s just using the same muscles as we use for walking around. In fact, a freestyle leg kick requires a very specific technique, strength and fitness. Get this right, and many of the other pieces of your stroke quickly fall into place. WHAT YOU’RE AIMING FOR The leg kick for freestyle is called a flutter kick. You kick from the hips (never the knees, though the knees do bend), causing your feet to flutter on relaxed --- Page 106 Text --- ankles at the end of fairly straight legs. You give a strong kick at the end of your arm recovery, on the opposite side. (This happens automatically and is not something you need to do consiously.) A good leg kick is a bit like the egg in a cake mix: leave it out, and the rest of the ingredients won’t stick together. The key functions of freestyle leg kick are: • Aiding a good, flat body position in the water • Balancing your arm stroke • Adding propulsion, or forward drive, to your stroke – the kick’s least important job, as it provides less than a tenth of your propulsion The flutter kick isn’t a big, splashy kick.

good, flat body position in the water • Balancing your arm stroke • Adding propulsion, or forward drive, to your stroke – the kick’s least important job, as it provides less than a tenth of your propulsion The flutter kick isn’t a big, splashy kick. One of the most common mistakes people make is to do a large, deliberate kick from the knee, bending it almost as if they’re kicking a football. Kicking like this causes drag, affects your body position and upsets your arm technique. It’s like pulling a sea anchor along behind you. KICKING RHYTHM In freestyle, kicking rhythm is counted over a cycle of two arm strokes (one stroke by each arm). This means kicking once every arm stroke gives you a two- beat kick, twice equals a four-beat kick and three times gives a six-beat kick. Each rhythm has advantages, depending on the kind of swimming you do and your ability level. Six-beat kick This rhythm provides a good level of propulsion and balances the rest of the stroke extremely well. It can, though, be very tiring at first, which makes it most suited to competitive swimmers with a good, efficient technique. Four-beat kick This is a good basic rhythm. It provides a combination of balancing your stroke, conserving energy and providing a bit of forward power. Two-beat kick This provides little or no propulsion, but uses very little energy. The two-beat kick is used mainly by distance swimmers, who place a premium on endurance. --- Page 107 Text --- The turbulence of a two-beat kick The turbulence of a four-beat kick The turbulence of a six-beat kick KICK TRAINING PRINCIPLES There are a few principles that are worth sticking to when doing technique training for the flutter kick. 1 Try not to swim head-up Even

Page 107 Text --- The turbulence of a two-beat kick The turbulence of a four-beat kick The turbulence of a six-beat kick KICK TRAINING PRINCIPLES There are a few principles that are worth sticking to when doing technique training for the flutter kick. 1 Try not to swim head-up Even in most swimming clubs you’ll see swimmers doing freestyle kick training with their arms resting on a float and their head sticking up in the air. You don’t swim freestyle with your head up in the air – if possible, don’t train your body to kick in this unnatural position. Of course, swimming with your face in the water does make breathing tricky. The best way round the problem is to use a special swimming snorkel, which instead of going to the side of your head rises in front of your nose and forehead. --- Page 108 Text --- With a swimming snorkel you can concentrate on keeping a nice, flat body position, rather than lifting your head to breathe every few seconds. Using a swimming snorkel in public does require a certain degree of self-confidence, as it makes you look like an extra from a sci-fi movie. There are significant benefits though. 2 Use fins sparingly Swim fins are a good training aid: they are useful in supporting your body during arm drills, and in fitness work they load your legs and build strength. Unfortunately, fins are also the crack cocaine of the swimming world: highly addictive. Nothing beats the feeling of bombing down the pool like a turbocharged human/seal hybrid. Watch out you don’t get hooked. Overusing fins gives your body a false idea of what can be expected from your legs. Then, once you take them off, your technique falls apart. --- Page 109 Text --- Fins

that’s well out of your depth. Cross your arms over your chest, palms flat. Kick hard to keep your head above water, using the flutter kick described at the start of this chapter. Take care not to start using an eggbeater kick, a kind of alternate breaststroke kick used by water polo players to lift their torsos out of the water. Ideally, try to maintain the exercise for at least 30 seconds before stopping for a 15-second rest, then repeating it. Doing this a total of five or six times each session should be enough. --- Page 114 Text --- Version 1 – least tough. Version 2 – harder In this version of the drill, instead of crossing your arms over your chest you lift your hands free of the water. Just keep your hands and forearms in the air, with your elbows below the surface. Version 2 – harder. --- Page 115 Text --- Version 3 – very testing This time, instead of putting only your hands in the air, lift up both arms into the streamlined position. You’ll have to kick very hard even to get your head above water for a breath. Only try this version when you’re comfortably able to complete five or six repetitions of the second iteration of this drill. Otherwise you risk swallowing a magnum of pool water and putting yourself off swimming forever. Version 3 – very testing. Kicking: building strength (part 1) This is a land-based training technique you can do anywhere. It builds leg strength, improves technique and strengthens your core.

Lie on your back, with your hands tucked under your bottom, lifting your hips slightly. 2. Raise your legs straight off the ground by about 20 cm, and flutter your feet, flicking your ankles as fast as you can. Do this without consciously bending your knees: try to make the movement come from the hips and thighs. 3. Keep this up – with your feet fluttering as fast as you can possibly manage – for 30 seconds. This is when having someone else there for encouragement helps! 4. Lower your legs and have a rest for one minute. Repeat at least once. As you get better at this drill, build up the time from 30 seconds to a minute and increase the number of repetitions you do. --- Page 117 Text --- Top tip FLEX YOUR ANKLES Ankle flexibility is a crucial part of the flutter kick. Improve yours by sitting with your ankle over your knee, gripping your heel and toes, and winding your foot in circles first one way, then the other, for a minute in each direction before changing feet. Kicking: building strength (part 2) This is an advanced land-based drill, which helps improve both leg strength for kicking and core body strength. It requires good balance and a certain amount of flexibility. Take this drill steady, and if your back or neck (or both) feel painful or uncomfortable, ease yourself back to a lying-down position and stop. What you need • A yoga mat or similar cushioning 1. Lie flat on your back with your arms by your sides. Bend forward, and with a

As your feet plant on the wall, let the pushing hand drop through the air and in front of your head. Drive away from the wall.

You may have bought this book with just that sort of swim in mind. If so, everything you’ve read so far will come in useful, but this chapter will add a few final hints and tips that should make the challenge even more fun. OPEN-WATER EVENTS --- Page 151 Text --- Open-water swimming actually encompasses a tremendous range of types of swimming. The simplest is wild swimming – taking pleasure in swimming somewhere other that a chemically sterile pool. At the other extreme is open- water racing, long-distance endurance events in which the world’s top swimmers race for hours, and usually finish just seconds apart. There are also solo endurance swims such as Channel crossings, swim-trek holidays and even open- water orienteering. Whatever kind of open-water swim you’re planning, they all have

extreme is open- water racing, long-distance endurance events in which the world’s top swimmers race for hours, and usually finish just seconds apart. There are also solo endurance swims such as Channel crossings, swim-trek holidays and even open- water orienteering. Whatever kind of open-water swim you’re planning, they all have a few things in common. Adaptability and a willingness to swim without lane lines or guides are key. • You’ll need to be able to adapt your stroke to the water conditions and temperature. • You’ll need to prepare for different swimming environments (i.e. how many other swimmers are in the water with you, and where the swim is taking place). • It’s important to adapt your training so that it suits the kind of swim you’re planning to do. SWIM WITH A TRAINING PARTNER As with any sport, your training needs to mirror the thing you’re training for. If you’re taking part in an open-water event, this obviously means some, at least, of your training should be done in open water. It’s a really good idea to do this with a training partner. Ideally you want another swimmer of about the same standard as you, but you could also go out with a kayaker, SUP paddler, paddleboarder, etc. --- Page 152 Text --- There are two key benefits to a training partner: Safety: Open water, particularly the ocean, is potentially a lot more dangerous than pool swimming. Having someone with you makes things a little safer. Motivation: The open-water environment can be a bit off-putting on cold, wet days. Knowing someone else is relying on you to come out helps. Having someone swimming alongside also helps you to push your level, rather than sitting back and taking it easy. Of course, you’ll also get to share the joy of

alternate sides, simply by rolling your body. Don’t move your arms or turn your neck to breathe, just roll your body. 3. After one length, take off your fins and put your pull buoy between your ankles (not your thighs as usual) or calves. Swim two lengths like this, concentrating on rolling your body with each stroke. 4. Take a 10-or 15-second rest, and repeat until you have done 15 lengths in total. --- Page 159 Text --- Fins off and pull buoy between ankles Top tip USE YOUR KICK FOR BALANCE, NOT SPEED In open-water events, which tend to be over longer distances, your kick’s key job is to maintain your body position and balance your arm stroke, not to provide forward movement. Aim to make small, neat kicks. If your feet sometimes cross, pointing your toes will help prevent this. TECHNIQUE: LEG KICK The leg kick for open-water is the same as for pool swimming, a flutter kick. There’s no need to make big changes, though a kick with low amplitude (the distance your feet move from top to bottom) creates less drag. --- Page 160 Text --- KICKING RHYTHM If you normally use a four-or six-beat kick, you may want to adjust your kicking rhythm. Kicking your legs isn’t a very energy-efficient way to get propulsion, and over the long distances of open-water events a high kicking cadence is very draining. If you’re about to climb on to a bike and ride 40km, then run 10km, this is a particularly bad idea. As a result, endurance swimmers and triathletes rely less on their legs than pool swimmers, except at the start or finish. They mostly use a two-beat kick, and gain less than 5 per cent of their propulsion from their legs. As a comparison, pool swimmers

is a particularly bad idea. As a result, endurance swimmers and triathletes rely less on their legs than pool swimmers, except at the start or finish. They mostly use a two-beat kick, and gain less than 5 per cent of their propulsion from their legs. As a comparison, pool swimmers get closer to 10 per cent of their propulsion from their legs. Head position, direction, and sighting The most streamlined head position for freestyle is to be looking straight down, rather than ahead. In the pool, most swimmers are forced to compromise this: they need to avoid crashing into people in front, and to spot the wall for turns. These aren’t problems in open water, so it’s possible to keep a perfect head position most of the time. The only difficulty is that in an open-water swim you need to check where you’re going from time to time. Training to swim in a straight line is a big help, and the next drill (balanced arms) should be useful. But you will still need to ‘sight’ – lift your head to see whether you’re on course for the turn or finish you’re aiming for: 1. Finish breathing out until your leading hand enters the water. 2. Lift your head forward while pressing down (rather than pulling back) with your leading hand. At the same time, kick harder. 3. As your head rises, take a mental photo of the course, and immediately drop it back down into the streamlined position. Don’t take a breath – if your head comes out that high, you’ve lifted it too far. 4. Take an arm stroke, during which your body rolls to the side allowing you to take a breath as usual. --- Page 162 Text --- Balanced-arms drill This exercise is useful for a) finding

a breath – if your head comes out that high, you’ve lifted it too far. 4. Take an arm stroke, during which your body rolls to the side allowing you to take a breath as usual. --- Page 162 Text --- Balanced-arms drill This exercise is useful for a) finding out whether one of your arm strokes is more powerful than the other, and b) correcting imbalances. In open water, balanced arms will make it easier to swim in a straight line. You will need • Fins • Pull buoy 1. Push off in a streamlined position, with fins on and the pull buoy between your thighs. 2. Swim a timed 50m using only your right arm. Concentrate on maintaining a high elbow during the pulling phase, and breathe every three or four strokes. 3. Repeat with your left arm, then run through the whole exercise twice more (so you’ll have done 3 × 50m on each arm). 4. Average out your times on each arm. If one is significantly slower, work on --- Page 163 Text --- improving that arm’s stroke. Some coaches recommend wearing a hand paddle to strengthen a weak arm. A better alternative is probably to use volume training: do one-arm drills in units of three, with two on your weaker arm and one on the stronger one. --- Page 166 Text --- If you’re lucky enough to have access to a whole pool, positioning turn buoys at the corners, near the backstroke flags, gives you a big area of water to work with. You can swim along the edges, between the corners in an X shape, in a Z pattern ... wherever you imagination (or your coach) leads you. Even if some of the pool is taken up with other swimmers and you can only

(In fact, it’s a good idea to build up to 130 per cent of your event distance.) This can be done in a pool, though ideally not in a single lane, as you need space to turn around without touching the wall and this can be cramped in a single lane’s width. The ideal is to get access to a whole pool, though a couple of lanes is enough. If you set up buoys in opposite corners, you can swim the entire race distance without touching the sides or breaking your stroke. Training with other open-water swimmers in the pool also gives you the chance to swim in conditions you’ll experience in the event. Try all setting off together, for example, to get a feel for swimming in crowded water at the start. Follow other swimmers, or swim beside them, to get a feel for drafting. Paceline training One good exercise for anyone planning an open-water swim is to train in a paceline. You need at least three swimmers, and no more than five. The paceline allows everyone to build endurance, even in a mixed-ability group. It works in pretty much the same way as on a bike: 1. Set off in a line, with each swimmer close behind the one in front. You need to be almost touching their feet. 2. After a set distance or time, the leader pulls off the front. In a pool, it’s best just to stop after, say, 100m and let everyone else go by; in open water, the leader can just drift back after a minute on the front, then tag

becoming easier and a little quicker too – which is really satisfying. You set off for a few more laps and then suddenly in the next lane over a young girl jumps in the water, probably about 11 years old, and comes flying past you like you are barely moving. Before you know it she has executed a perfect tumble turn and comes back past you the other way, a near blur of fast moving, perfectly synchronised arms and legs. If you are an adult who has been swimming for a little while you have almost certainly had a similar experience to this. It can be quite a shock and even disheartening. ‘How can she do that? She is just a kid!’. Don’t worry, everyone has been passed by a much faster swimmer at some point in their lives and made to feel a little inadequate. Kids are not as physically strong as adults and don’t have the option of muscling their way through the water; instead they must use a good stroke technique – and high levels of aerobic fitness – to propel themselves quickly forwards. The fact that someone so small with very little strength can swim so quickly shows you what amazing potential each of us has in the water if we too can develop these areas of our swimming. Try not to be disheartened by the speed of fast swimmers but instead see them as an inspiration: how a child can swim so well and be so comfortable in the water is an amazing thing and there are many lessons the aspiring adult swimmer can learn from them. This book is devoted to anyone looking to improve their freestyle swimming. You might be very new to swimming and are trying to become more comfortable in the

into a simple step-by-step process for you to follow (Appendix B) that is highly tailored to your individual needs. Before leaving Stroke Technique we will take you through a special feature showing you how to perform a video analysis on your own swimming and how to identify common flaws in your stroke. Referring you to the right section of this book we will highlight how to work on and fix those flaws, making your swimming more comfortable, more efficient and faster too. Very highly recommended! Swim Specific Fitness Training (Key 2) shows you how you should best train for distance swimming events such as open water swims and triathlon. Fitness from other sports rarely carries over very well to swimming, and developing your aerobic fitness in the water will make a huge difference to your comfort and speed in the water. It will also help you to sustain a better stroke technique as you swim and so improve your efficiency too. This section works in tandem with Appendix C, which contains hundreds of combinations of training sessions for you to follow. --- Page 21 Text --- To complete the section on training, we examine specific flexibility and conditioning work to improve your swimming posture and also avoid injury. The exercises in this section perfectly complement everything we cover in Keys 1–3 and will be essential if you suffer from any pain or injury during or after swimming. Open Water Skills (Key 3) explains how to prepare for open water swimming so as to have a confident, comfortable and fast race! Removing anxiety, drafting techniques, sighting and navigation are all included in detail. You can develop and practise these skills in the pool as well as the open water, in fact there are some advantages to doing so in the pool.

page at www.swimsmooth.com/worldrecords has a full and up-to-date listing of these complete records and makes for fascinating reading when comparing it to your own times! ‘Hypoxic Breathing’ is the process of swimming whilst limiting your supply of oxygen by breathing less frequently than normal, typically every five, seven or nine strokes. Many coaches state that this helps to build lung capacity and aerobic endurance but definitive studies demonstrating this are lacking. At Swim Smooth we use sets of restricted breathing frequency to allow the swimmer to focus on a deeper exhalation in the water rather than holding your breath. When breathing less frequently you should aim to stay calm and to allow yourself time to focus on the symmetry of your stroke. ‘Drafting’ is the act of swimming behind or to the side of another swimmer to gain an advantage. This is perfectly legal in open water swimming and triathlon and viewed --- Page 32 Text --- as fair-play with swimmers looking to maximise the benefit they gain when racing. As we shall see in Chapter 36, there are two positions to draft in, either directly behind or to the side and slightly behind another swimmer. ‘Sighting’ is the act of raising the head above the water’s surface to look forward and navigate in open water whilst swimming. Lifting the head places downward pressure on the legs as the body pivots around its centre and this creates extra drag. As we shall see in Chapter 35, a good sighting technique minimises the head lift to minimise additional drag. Training Session Terminology Please see Appendix C for special abbreviations and terminology relating to training sessions. --- Page 33 Text --- CHAPTER 3 Swimming Equipment There is a wide variety of swimming equipment and training aids available on the market, which are

conventional paddles work on the assumption that if you create a larger surface area for the hand to work against it will help you develop a greater catch and feel for the water. However, overuse of large paddles with poor technique can be very troublesome for your shoulders. They might also slow your stroke rate down to an unrealistically low rate and with swimming being limited more by technique than brute strength, the notion that you need to become stronger to swim faster is normally misguided. PT and Palm Paddles work as a direct opposite to a normal paddle in that their convex shape removes the sensation of a good catch and thus encourages you to bend your elbow more under the water to gain a better catch with the forearm. When used for the first time they really feel like your hands are slipping through the water but that is --- Page 37 Text --- precisely the point – remove the paddle after 50 m to 100 m and your sense of ‘feel for the water’ is greatly heightened. 8. Other Conventional Paddles – there is a huge range of the more conventional style of paddle available on the market, with new designs being created all the time. Conventional paddles still have a place in the kit bag of more advanced swimmers with good stroke technique and certainly the smaller ‘finger paddles’ (not shown) are great for developing a better initial catch. Avoid overuse of any paddle and be wary of the desire to become stronger by using them – it’s usually the stronger athletes, who need a little more finesse in their stroke, who tend to reach for the big dinner-plate paddles before anyone else in the squad. 9.

way to identify flaws in your stroke if you are not fortunate enough to have a coach watching over you when you swim. --- Page 46 Text --- CHAPTER 6 Stroke Flaws – Cause and Effect A Never-Ending Pursuit Working on your stroke technique is not just something for swimmers new to freestyle; every swimmer of any ability level should regularly work on their stroke – it’s a never- ending pursuit. Nearly all swimmers, even those who are swimming very well, have areas of their technique they could improve on significantly which would make their stroke more efficient, relaxed, faster or offer better endurance. Even an Olympic champion with a fantastic stroke will still spend a significant portion of their weekly training maintaining and reinforcing their technique; without doing so their performances could easily drop off. Working on your stroke technique does not sound very exciting but it can actually be a lot of fun: it brings variety to your swim training and gives you a different sort of challenge to that offered by fitness training. We will use the Swim Smooth drill set (Appendix A) to assist you in this task; each drill or visualisation is a highly developed tool to help you work on the weaker areas in your stroke technique. Cause and Effect Before we start looking at each area of the freestyle stroke, it is important to remember that when you jump in the water to correct your stroke you need to keep things simple at all times. To help you do this, Swim Smooth uses a simple but deceptively powerful coaching philosophy called ‘Cause and Effect’. Cause and Effect says that for every stroke flaw (the effect) there is an underlying cause for it. This is powerful because it helps you get to the root

have a crossover in your stroke or you lack body rotation then it’s very likely that you need to work on your swimming posture in this way. Improving your posture will also increase the length of your stroke as it helps you extend forward much straighter, this is of direct benefit to your swimming efficiency. We will take a good look at some exercises and drills in this section to help you tune in to this part of your --- Page 74 Text --- stroke and we’ll recommend some simple stretches to help loosen off your chest and shoulders in Chapter 29. Transferring Power from Your Rotation to Your Arm Stroke Hopefully you can see how your upper core helps connect your arm stroke to your body. Swimming with good posture forms a strong connection between the two and lets you utilise the larger muscle groups of the chest and upper back to help drive the arm stroke. Swimming with poor posture tends to overload the weaker shoulder muscle groups, which will quickly fatigue. Having a stable upper core, combined with a good catch and rotation technique will really help you to generate some controlled power in the stroke. PAUL: The good news here is that you do not need to be physically strong to swim well, this is one reason why that 11-year-old girl can go zooming past you in the pool with very little upper-body strength. The key is to get in the right positions with a good stroke rhythm and that will produce the necessary power with surprisingly little feeling of force. Developing Better Posture in the Pool At Swim Smooth we like to use drills that involve kicking on your side to improve your posture. Many swimmers have performed similar drills before but normally think of

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
good lower core control is to your stroke technique, we can easily forget about it when we swim. An excellent way to remind yourself is to use a good torpedo push-off (also known as a streamline) at the beginning of every length which involves stretching through your core. Doing this will improve the connection between your upper and lower body at the beginning of every length and help remind you to keep that connection and feeling of stretch in place for the whole lap. PAUL: Many of the triathletes who swim with us in Perth think that they don’t need the discipline of a good torpedo push-off at the beginning of every lap because they don’t get to push off in open water. Whilst this is true, they are missing out on developing their core control when swimming which is so essential to avoid fish-tailing (legs sweeping from side to side) and to keep the body high in the water. Dry Land Core Conditioning Most swimmers and triathletes have enough core strength to swim very well, it’s more a matter of coordinating and engaging the core muscles in the right way. Unless you have very poor core strength indeed it’s not normally necessary to add in additional gym classes to your training routine. Saying that, a strong core has many benefits on dry land so we wouldn’t discourage you from a good pilates or yoga class either! Time availability will always be the limiting factor for most non-professional swimmers, so the more specifically you can introduce good core control into your normal swim sessions the better. PAUL: Just to prove this point, it’s normally the gym junkies who can do hundreds of sit-ups who have the worst core control in the water! For more information on dry-land conditioning that you

the more specifically you can introduce good core control into your normal swim sessions the better. PAUL: Just to prove this point, it’s normally the gym junkies who can do hundreds of sit-ups who have the worst core control in the water! For more information on dry-land conditioning that you can adopt within your programme in a time efficient way, see Chapters 29 and 30. --- Page 80 Text --- CHAPTER 11 Rotation and Arm Recovery Body rotation (sometimes simply called ‘body roll’) is the rotation of the swimmer along the long axis of the spine as they swim. A good freestyle stroke technique has between 45° and 60° of rotation to each side on every stroke, not just when they breathe. This helps the swimmer use the large muscle groups of the core, back and chest to help drive the stroke. A swimmer with poor rotation tends to overuse the small weak shoulder muscles, which soon fatigue. A swimmer should rotate between 45° and 60° on every stroke they take. --- Page 81 Text --- THE KEBAB STICK VISUALISATION Imagine that your body has been skewered on a kebab stick, running through your head and body down to your feet. As the kebab stick is rotated your body rotates as one with the legs, hips and shoulders rotating together. Rotate ‘as one’ along your long axis, as if you were skewered on a kebab stick! Many swimmers feel they should kick vertically at all times when they swim but this misconception can really harm your rotation. Instead you should kick with your rotation: Mr Smooth’s kick also rotates with his body roll. Developing Good Rotation --- Page 82 Text --- To develop your rotation use the Kick-On-Side, 6-1-6 and 6-3-6 drill sequences from Appendix A as described in Chapter

the shoulder joint; for adult age-group swimmers and triathletes we recommend a less extreme position at this point in stroke. --- Page 102 Text --- See Figure 13.10 for a comparison of these positions, note that the elbow is still higher than the wrist and the wrist higher than the fingertips in a more conventional catching position. The conventional catch still creates a lot of propulsion and allows you to swim very quickly indeed. Olympic swimmer Jono Van Hazel who features in our Catch Masterclass DVD swam sub-50 seconds for 100m using such a catch, so there is no shortage of speed available! FIGURE 13.10 An extreme ‘EVF position’ (top) has the arm nearly vertical in front of the head. A conventional catch (bottom) has a less extreme vertical forearm. Your Strength and the Catch Referring to Figure 13.11 try the following practical exercise: FIGURE 13.11 Use a friend or coach to investigate your muscular recruitment in the catch position. --- Page 103 Text --- Position 1: Stand square on and face your friend with your arm locked straight out in front of you. Have them support your hand and press down on it hard. Notice how all the effort is coming from your shoulder muscles and how your friend does not struggle to resist you too much. This is not because you are not strong but because all the effort is coming from your shoulders, which are a relatively small, weak muscle group. This position demonstrates a poor catch technique with the swimmer pushing down on the water with a straight arm. Position 2: Standing in the same position, now bend your elbow and again push down on your friend’s hand. Notice how you are now starting to engage your back and chest muscle groups, which are stronger –

whether you are holding your breathing underwater – we should see a constant stream of bubbles exiting from either your nose or mouth. --- Page 140 Text --- PAUL: One word of caution when performing your own video analysis: don’t become so pedantic about your stroke that you invoke ‘paralysis by analysis’. Rome wasn’t built in a day, so after breaking your stroke down work on a single aspect at a time, this will be much more productive than trying to change everything at once. As you go along, use the Stroke Technique (Key 1) chapters of this book to recognise the Cause and Effect nature of your stroke flaws and discover what the underlying causes are. Remember: one at a time! Should We All Swim The Same? --- Page 141 Text --- CHAPTER 17 The Swim Types System Coaching the Swimmer, Not the Stroke Since Swim Smooth’s creation in 2004, we’ve talked a lot about the need for an individual approach in swimming; how swimmers needed to work on different aspects of their technique based on their age, height, experience, gender and even personality. In contrast to this, many traditional swimming programmes treat everyone the same and have them repeat the same visualisations and drills constantly with one ideal stroke in mind. This one-dimensional approach has several major disadvantages: Ceinwen is 1.60 m tall and Andy is 2.00 m. Should these two swimmers adopt the same stroke style? The vision of a perfect stroke may not suit the swimmer’s physical attributes e.g. height, strength, gender, natural buoyancy. The starting point of the swimmer is ignored and so the coaching is never tailored to their individual needs. As a consequence their rate of progress is dramatically slowed or stops completely. --- Page 142 Text --- No account is taken of

physical attributes e.g. height, strength, gender, natural buoyancy. The starting point of the swimmer is ignored and so the coaching is never tailored to their individual needs. As a consequence their rate of progress is dramatically slowed or stops completely. --- Page 142 Text --- No account is taken of the environment in which the swimmer is racing and the importance of tailoring the swimmer’s stroke technique to those conditions. e.g. pool versus open water and wetsuit versus non-wetsuit swimming. Our Swim Types system is a way of taking a much more individual approach to your swimming: Swim Types gives you the option of two ideal stroke styles to head towards, one of which will suit your physical make-up and personality. Your current stroke technique is recognised and a tailored development path is set for you, allowing you to take rapid steps forward. The system shows you how differing styles suit different race environments and helps you develop your stroke to excel in those conditions. This is not just about maximum performance, the right stroke style will make things much more comfortable and enjoyable too. Swim Types has been used internally by Swim Smooth coaches since 2008 but since the website www.swimtypes.com was launched in 2010, it has been used directly by swimmers with hundreds of thousands of followers from around the world visiting the site and using the system. The Development of Swim Types The Swim Types system is Paul Newsome’s brainchild, here he takes a look back at the thinking behind the system and how it was created: --- Page 143 Text --- PAUL: Coming from a competitive swimming background as a kid growing up in the UK, I always found it fascinating to see how different body types and builds gravitated towards each of the four competitive

theoreticians seemed to be looking past those swimmers excelling in events longer than 400 m in the pool and open water when they wrote their manuals on how all of us should aim to swim. Enter Shelley Taylor-Smith, seven times World Cup marathon swimming champion and open water specialist from Perth. In 1991 Shelley was ranked number one in the world for women and men in marathon swimming events and in the same year she won the 25 km open water event at the World Aquatics Championships in the Swan River in Perth. In no other endurance sporting event would a woman out-perform the men and yet here was Shelley doing just that, breaking all the rules. Not only was Shelley breaking the gender rules, she was also breaking the stroke rules too! At 1.65 m / 5′ 5″ Shelley wasn’t able to swim with less than 40 strokes per 50 m in the pool as most of the guys would do, instead she would take around 52 strokes. Shelley would generate her speed by matching this stroke length with a very fast stroke rate around 90 strokes per minute. For many such a high stroke rate with so many strokes per length would have been laughed off as inefficient but here was one of the world’s best ever distance swimmers doing just that, winning world championship after world championship and often beating all the men in the process. Shelley had developed and refined a stroke which was the most optimal style for her, as did Olympic Champion Janet Evans before her and Laure Manadou, David Davies and Lotte Friis (all Olympic Medallists) have done since. Meeting Shelley and seeing her in action was mind-blowing and I was seeing more and more that the consensus in swimming was wrong and

optimal style for her, as did Olympic Champion Janet Evans before her and Laure Manadou, David Davies and Lotte Friis (all Olympic Medallists) have done since. Meeting Shelley and seeing her in action was mind-blowing and I was seeing more and more that the consensus in swimming was wrong and there was more than one type of fast and efficient freestyle stroke. Whilst everything in the printed media and online at this time was still saying ‘longer strokes are always better’, in practice I was finding that whilst this would work for some, for others this advice was proving totally detrimental if they simply didn’t have the physical height and strength to make it work for them. In pursuing a very long stroke, these swimmers were creating as many problems in their technique as they were solving. I coined the phrase ‘Overglider’ as far back as 2004 after seeing so many swimmers introducing a --- Page 146 Text --- long glide to their stroke to try and lengthen it out as much as possible. These swimmers had pretty good alignment and body position but were stuck on a performance plateau whilst in pursuit of an ever-longer stroke. With my sports-science background I respect the fact that research and evidence was needed to test hypothesis and the evidence was stacking up here against the ‘longer is more efficient’ world view. Thinking back to my own swimming, a long stroke would have been great for the 1.9 m tall giants with powerful kicks to push them through the gap between strokes but I was neither tall nor was I very good at kick! Nor were many of the swimmers that I was coaching and most were training for open water swimming and triathlon where the conditions are much bumpier from swimming in

often used by elite swimmers and triathletes to great effect. It’s a shorter, punchier style that’s won many Olympic Gold Medals in the pool, but in rougher open water its natural emphasis on stroke rhythm makes it completely dominant and is used by a significant majority of elite swimmers in this environment. Until now the Swinger stroke style has been much misunderstood and underappreciated in the swimming world as it is not as aesthetically pleasing as the Smooth style, at least not when viewed above the water. When speaking to Swingers, nearly all are under the impression that they don’t have a very good stroke and that they are succeeding in swimming despite their technique when actually nothing could be further from the truth. If you follow professional cycling there’s an interesting analogy here. Jan Ullrich and Lance Armstrong were famous for racing head to head in the Tour de France with very different pedalling styles. Jan liked to turn over a very big gear, while Lance would spin a smaller gear at a faster speed. Each worked perfectly for each cyclist as it suited their individual biomechanics, style and physiology. The same is true for swimmers and their natural stroke style – you could say the Swinger is Lance Armstrong to the Smooth’s Jan Ullrich. The Swim Types system highlights the strengths and weaknesses of these two ideal styles and shows you which is the best for you to pursue, depending on your individual build and the environment in which you are going to swim. Identifying Your Swim Type --- Page 148 Text --- We are sure you are dying to discover your own Swim Type! There are three ways to do this: By reading the profiles of each type in Chapters 18–23; the chances are you will immediately

back is their low body position in the water, which is caused by a combination of stroke flaws which each need to be tackled in turn: A strong tendency to hold onto their breath underwater which harms relaxation and creates excess buoyancy in the chest, lifting the front end up and pushing the legs downward. Since Arnies tend to have significant lean muscle mass they are always quite ‘sinky’ in the water and so are more vulnerable to this effect than any other type. Working on a relaxed smooth exhalation into the water is key to improving their body position. Of all the Swim Types, the Arnie is the most susceptible to crossing over in front of the head. Kicking from the knee rather than the hip is a key Arnie trait. This adds significant drag, lowering the legs in the water and burns large amounts of oxygen from overly utilising the large quadriceps and hamstring muscle groups. Arnies swim flat in the water and miss out on using their body rotation to lengthen the stroke and help drive it. This style of swimming overuses the shoulder muscles, which partly explains why many Arnies have poor swimming endurance. --- Page 155 Text --- Another classic Arnie trait is a large scissor kick, which drags the legs down low in the water. The lack of body rotation causes the arms to swing around the side of the Arnie with the momentum carrying the hand across the centre line in front of the head. Arnies often have stiff upper backs and shoulders, which, combined with this low swinging arm recovery, can exacerbate crossovers further. Whilst it’s possible for any swimmer to have a scissor kick, the Arnie is the most susceptible because of their tendency to cross over in front of the

swimmers like her defy the conventional swimming logic that you must always swim with a long stroke in order to be efficient. Here lies the Swinger: fast and efficient but unappreciated and unloved — until now! See Laure swim here: www.swimsmooth.com/manadou Swingers are nearly always experienced swimmers with many years of swimming behind them, often from a young age. Classic Swingers have a shorter stroke than many other swimmers but make up for it with a fast stroke rate; this distinctive ‘punchy’ style is very natural to them, they find it very hard and quite alien to swim in any other way. The good news is that it’s not necessary to change that style at all, by refining it and working to their natural strengths of great rhythm and momentum they can become exceptionally fast swimmers both in the pool and in open water. --- Page 172 Text --- The fast stroke rate used by a Swinger means that they roll their body to a slightly lesser extent than the Smooth Swim Type. This means that their arms come a little more around the sides rather than over the top of the body, in doing so they use a straighter arm recovery. This swinging recovery style of a classic Swinger is where they get their name. ADAM: Swingers tend to look quite choppy and unrefined from above the water, which has given them a bad press in swimming circles over the years. Since the invention of underwater video technology we now get to see the beautiful part of their stroke: under the water. Here a refined Swinger’s stroke mechanics are poetry in motion: a great catch and perfect rhythm and timing all working together in perfect harmony! In terms of speed, Swingers cover a very large range depending on the

to get on and swim with minimum stoppages or distractions such as drills likes to wear bright bathers! --- Page 173 Text --- Whilst there are examples of Swingers performing well with a 6-beat kick, a classic Swinger really comes into their own with a 2-beat kick. A refined Swinger uses their kick with great timing, using it to drive their body rotation from one side to the other, which in turn drives the arm stroke. Whilst they may not achieve much propulsion directly from their kick, they use it to drive the arm stroke which is a much more efficient use of the kick effort. To achieve really high stroke rates a Swinger needs to use a 2-beat kick, a 6-beat kick simply becomes too rapid at these stroke rates to keep up with (see Chapter 9 on the various kicking styles). PAUL: When I ask an Overglider what they think of when they swim, they can list off several parts of their stroke they are thinking about at any one time! But ask a Swinger the same question and you tend to get a blank look or an answer like ‘nothing really!’. A Swinger’s ability (and preference) to switch off their brain and just swim is a strength in many ways. Focused stroke technique development has an important place in swimming (and Swingers may well be guilty of skipping over this part of their preparation) but at other times it’s very important to stop analysing and just swim, which is when the Swinger’s ‘stop talking and let me get on with it’ personality really comes into its own! Unrefined Swingers may have stroke faults such as crossovers, scissor kicks and a hurried catch but the fundamental punch and rhythm is always in place. If you are a Swinger

which is when the Swinger’s ‘stop talking and let me get on with it’ personality really comes into its own! Unrefined Swingers may have stroke faults such as crossovers, scissor kicks and a hurried catch but the fundamental punch and rhythm is always in place. If you are a Swinger whose stroke has become a little ragged over the years you need to take some time out to work on some refinements in your stroke technique. You’ll polish up quite quickly and will soon be back to what you love best — swimming long sets and swimming them fast! Swingers and Open Water Swimming Open water swimming is a natural strength of Swingers and they really become a dominant force in this environment. Their faster stroke rate style helps punch through chop and wake from other swimmers and the longer distance races suit their natural disposition towards endurance events. Where they may lose out to some talented swimmers with long smooth strokes in the pool, they are able to turn the tables on them in open water. Becoming a Swinger In many ways there are two types of Swinger, those who naturally adopt this style (‘classic Swingers’) and those who have developed their strokes towards this style out of necessity. Many swimmers who are short in height or with short arms are forced to use a shorter faster stroke style to swim quickly and efficiently, and so gravitate towards the Swinger style as they develop their strokes. Others are looking to race well in longer distance open water events or triathlon, so even though they are capable of swimming with the Smooth style they choose to adopt the Swinger route to be more efficient in this environment. Very often such swimmers are able to switch between the two stroke styles

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
The Smooth Swim Type is what everybody thinks of when they imagine a long efficient stroke style. They are the envy of the pool with their relaxed style moving them seemingly effortlessly through the water accompanied by a 6-beat kick. They are strong technically in all areas with great turns and starts, and they are normally competitive at backstroke, breaststroke and butterfly as well as freestyle. Most elite pool swimmers are Smooths, with all time greats such as Ian Thorpe and Alexander Popov typifying this category. Although many observers believe this style of stroke is very efficient and therefore well suited to distance swimming, in practice the opposite is true, most elite Smooths excel as sprinters and middle distance (200 m / 400 m) freestylers. Nearly all Smooths have a significant childhood swimming background, very few adults have been able to develop their strokes to this level without such a background, although it is possible. Smooths are talented athletes with excellent technical skills, coordination and awareness of their body movements in the water. When making modifications to their stroke Smooths are able to do so quickly and easily once they understand what they need to do. The Smooth stroke style is certainly efficient but that does not make it ‘effortless’ as many other swimmers might believe. A Smooth will tell you how hard they are actually working when they swim, it’s their huge control and technical ability that makes the stroke appear effortless from the outside. Think of their movements as being like those of an Olympic gymnast or ballet dancer — they have tremendous grace and poise but to do so they are using strength and control. --- Page 177 Text --- Olympian Jono Van Hazel shows us his classical high elbow recovery.

This is an important distinction to understand as many swimmers aspiring to the Smooth stroke style try and introduce the concept of ‘effortless swimming’ into their own strokes, which results in a slow stroke with poor rhythm and timing — anything but efficient. Although Smooths can look as though they have a slow stroke rate this is an illusion brought about by the sheer speed at which they are moving relative to their stroke rate. Smooths operate in the 65—75 strokes per minute range at a steady pace, 75—85 strokes per minute at race pace and even higher when sprinting 50 m. In contrast most Overgliders (who very much aspire to be Smooths) are swimming at 50 strokes per minute and below, slowed down by the imprinted pause-and-glide in their strokes. --- OCR from Page 177 Image 1 --- accomplished swimmer with a competitve swimming background, only found in the top lane of squads been there, seen it, done it!

Build set totalling 200 m to 500 m — these shorter sets are designed to elevate the heart rate and prepare you for a more active main set. 3. Main set totalling 1200 m to 2000 m — this set can focus on different areas, including technique and drills, shorter endurance work, speed sets, threshold development or open water skills. We will look at these more closely in this chapter. 4. Cool-down totalling 100 m to 400 m — this is an important component of any session and should be included as a way of reducing the heart rate, flushing the body of lactate build up and to generally loosen off and feel good in your stroke. Using this simple structure is an easy way to create some wonderfully engaging training sessions. To help get you started with this, in Appendix C we have listed six variations of each component which are loosely aimed at each of the six Swim Types.

of each component which are loosely aimed at each of the six Swim Types. Use them to construct your own training sessions and so perfectly balance your technique, fitness and open water skills work. You can follow any of the sets for any other Swim Type, they will all be useful for your swimming. PAUL: Given the variety of the five types of main sets listed (including six open water skills sessions and six pure technique sets), our Swim Smooth boffins have calculated that by mixing and matching the sets you can create up to 5,100 unique training sessions to follow. Wow — that’ll keep you going for a while! How Will the Different Types of Set Improve My Swimming? We can break down the different types of main set as follows: 1. Speed or sprint work. 2. Endurance training or continuous swimming. 3. Threshold or ‘Sustainable Speed’ sessions. Let’s take a look at each of these training methods in that order. It’s actually the order in which many Masters swimmers and triathletes prioritise their sessions, focusing a lot of training time on speed sessions, some time on endurance sets and relatively little time on sustained speed sessions. In Chapter 26 we will look at a different way to combine these sessions for best training effect as a distance swimmer has a very different set of priorities. By combining sessions in a different way you will soon be making some big strides forward in your swimming fitness. Session Type 1: Pure Speed or Sprint Work --- Page 187 Text --- For those of you who train with one of the many Masters swimming groups around the world, a large component of the training mix will be sprint work. This involves efforts at near maximum pace over short distances of 10

Pure Speed or Sprint Work --- Page 187 Text --- For those of you who train with one of the many Masters swimming groups around the world, a large component of the training mix will be sprint work. This involves efforts at near maximum pace over short distances of 10 m to 200 m with large amounts of recovery between each interval. For many swimmers, this type of training is believed to be the best way of getting faster because they are swimming at very high speed. Certainly if you will be racing over sprint distances (25 m to 200 m) such sets should form a good portion of your training time as they are specific to your event. However, if your focus is on distances over 400 m in the pool, or on triathlon and open water swimming, too much training at this intensity can actually limit your endurance ability as we will see later on in this chapter. Sprint sessions offer the swimmer significant rest periods between each interval to allow higher intensities to be held when swimming. The ratio of work to rest might be anywhere from 3:1 to 1:1 (or more). An example sprint set is: Sprint training is essential if you plan to race in events of less than 200 m. If not then your valuable training time might be best spent with sub-maximal threshold sessions and aerobic endurance work. 8 × 50 m aiming for 40 seconds per interval with 20 to 30 seconds rest between each 50 m In Appendix C you will find six specific sprint sessions that you can incorporate into your programme if you are seeking to improve your outright speed for shorter events below 400 m. If you are competing over longer distances and swimming five or more times

rest between each 50 m In Appendix C you will find six specific sprint sessions that you can incorporate into your programme if you are seeking to improve your outright speed for shorter events below 400 m. If you are competing over longer distances and swimming five or more times per week, then you also probably have some scope to add this type of training to your weekly programme so long as it does not replace more essential threshold-based training. Session Type 2: Endurance Sessions In its simplest form an endurance session might be a long continuous swim at a steady pace, designed to build up your ability to swim for a prolonged period of time without stopping. It is very common to see swimmers who have only a very limited time in which to train (e.g. lunch breaks) jump into the water and simply swim continuously for the entire time they have available. This type of training has its merits, however if every --- Page 188 Text --- session that you complete is swum continuously like this you could be missing out on developing your stroke technique and also run the risk of stagnating from swimming everything at the same steady pace. The mental challenge of longer swims can be significant as you are stuck in your personal ‘bubble’ with very little outside interaction. Here James has used the acronym JKS (Just Keep Swimming!) to keep him motivated during the 20 km Rottnest Channel Swim. This phrase went on to become a mantra of our marathon swimming squad! For those swimmers and triathletes attempting longer distance events (e.g. open water events longer than 2.5 km and triathletes training for a full Ironman), long continuous swims are a nice way of building your confidence that you can cover your target

to become a mantra of our marathon swimming squad! For those swimmers and triathletes attempting longer distance events (e.g. open water events longer than 2.5 km and triathletes training for a full Ironman), long continuous swims are a nice way of building your confidence that you can cover your target race distance. Later in Chapter 27 we will show you how to calculate the pace to hold for these swims so that you develop your base endurance whilst maintaining good form and technique. A classic mistake swimmers make with long continuous swims is to start too fast and then fade towards the end. Breaking down these endurance swims into a series of longer intervals with a short rest in-between will help you maintain focus and motivation and also give you a chance to take on board fluid and nutrition for swims over 45 minutes in length. Fuelling correctly in longer sessions is critical to your successful completion of these sessions and how quickly you recover afterwards. We will cover some specific fuelling strategies for longer swims in Chapter 32. An example of a simple endurance set might be 6 × 400 m at 75% effort with 30 seconds rest between each interval. Instead of thinking of this as 75% effort, you could swim this as ‘threshold pace plus eight seconds per 100 m’. We will look at this form of pace calculation later in Chapter 27. In Appendix C you will find six specific endurance sessions ranging in distance from 2.5 km to 6 km. These are designed to be completed without using one of the additional warm-up and build set suggestions as the warm-up is included within the main body of these sessions and encourages you to start off at a conservative pace as though you were starting a

mistake yourself, if you do you will soon blow-up and slow down — swimming most of the set at a slower pace than you otherwise could maintain if you had set off at the right pace. If this happens you have greatly harmed the training effect of the session and you will not develop your aerobic system to anywhere like the same extent as with a well-paced set. Arnies (from our Swim Type system, see Chapter 18) are particularly prone to doing this. I know from my own experience during my early days as a junior triathlete that the mention of the words ‘race pace’ or ‘time trial’ induces a sense of wild panic. If you try to remain calm in these situations and pace out such a swim perfectly, you might swim a PB straight away. Swimmers with very poor pacing always report that their swimming feels easy and smooth in the first couple of hundred meters but then their stroke quickly ‘falls apart’. They might blame a lack of fitness, endurance or the inability to hold good form, and whilst this might partly be the case, nine times out of ten it is simply a pacing issue. Repetitively training like this is not effective at all and will certainly impede your long- term development. In fact inaccurate pace judgement is one of the main reasons swimmers and triathletes fail to reach their potential in the water. ADAM: A coach we work closely with in Montréal, Canada (Charles Gaston-Couturier) describes the challenge of a good training set using something he calls the ‘Sweet Uncertainty Principle’ based on work done by Brunelle in 1988 [1]. A good training set challenges you just enough so that you are a little unsure of whether you can complete the set hitting your goal

motivated about the session ahead and if you swim too often you risk losing this ‘mojo’. If you’re swimming five times per week or more and find that you are constantly dreading your swimming sessions and have no motivation for them, try dropping back by one session per week and see if you can regain your spark. Elite swimmers and triathletes are particularly susceptible to over-training, and making a marginal cut in training volume has been the key for many of them in making some big steps forward in their performance. Paul and Martin plan the next phase of training for the Perth Swim Smooth squad. --- Page 192 Text --- More is not always better — effective training is about striking the right balance given everything you are trying to juggle in your training, work, family and social lives. PAUL: As a triathlete, coach and graduate of sports science, over the years I have invested a significant amount of my research and personal training time into devising the ideal training programme that has exactly the right training hours and precise training intensities. Ultimately this was a fruitless exercise as I found time and time again that what works for one athlete is simply not effective for another and that life events quickly ruin the prescribed training progression, often within just a few weeks of starting the programme. Instead, a much more pragmatic approach works best where you outline a basic skeleton structure which you work from loosely day to day, week to week and month to month. The structure gives you the right mix of sessions between technique development, steady endurance training, threshold sets and pure speed work which you can repeat over and over to give you the consistency you need.

day, week to week and month to month. The structure gives you the right mix of sessions between technique development, steady endurance training, threshold sets and pure speed work which you can repeat over and over to give you the consistency you need. The pace of the sessions themselves is adjusted based on your performances as you go along, adapting to your current fitness levels to keep pushing you forwards. Using such a skeleton structure when training is a very elegant and pragmatic approach and I highly recommend you use one yourself. In a moment we will look at some suggested structures for you to follow, depending on your ability level and the training time available. In terms of scheduling additional recovery time into your plan I recommend you very much listen to your body here, especially if you are only training two or three times per week. In this situation it is unlikely that you are training enough to warrant additional recovery and so if you feel good, carry on training as normal. If you feel a little flat after a hard block of training then take an easy session or some additional rest. My best results have always come from programmes that were simple, fun and motivating and that were laid out in such a way that I could consistently follow them week to week rather than the super whizz-bang scientifically prepared periodised programmes I’ve also tried to follow. Of course you have to have purpose and meaning behind what you do but if you are unable to adhere to a really sophisticated programme then you’re not going to get the most out of it. At the end of the day life throws curve-balls at all of us when we least expect it and if you can’t be

not talking about swimming at an easy pace here but a strong and sustained pace as you might in a bike time trial or distance running event. Rory proudly wears his Swim Smooth Rottnest Channel Swim shirt. The shirt shows the breakdown of a swimming diesel engine! --- OCR from Page 195 Image 1 --- set ene GEN GINEL --- Page 196 Text --- For the rest of this section of the book we are going to look at something called CSS swimming. This is a form of training that focuses on developing you as a distance swimmer, turning you from that petrol engine into a swimmer who can sustain their speed over long durations. By following this form of training you may lose some of your ability to sprint but your sustained speed will be much higher. Figure 27.17 shows a hypothetical example of this transition from petrol to diesel engine. FIGURE 27.17 The speed profiles of two very different swimmers. The sprinter wins over very short distances, the distance swimmer over longer distances. To put some real numbers on this, take a look at Table 27.5 showing Paul’s race speed at different distances before and during his English Channel preparation. Before training for the Channel Paul’s training contained a mix of sprint work and CSS sets, during the training he switched almost exclusively to CSS training and endurance training. We can see that although he became slower over 50 m, 100 m, and 200 m, by 400 m he is swimming at the same pace and at longer distances significantly quicker. When you have to swim the equivalent of 100 × 400 m to get across from Dover to France, sprint ability is not something you need too much of! Table 27.5 Paul Newsome’s race pace over different

to slow back down again. CSS is this point in your swimming, go faster than it and you will have to slow down, but swim at CSS and you will be able to swim for 800 m, 1500 m or even 3000 m if you are very well trained. PAUL: I studied Sports and Exercise Science at the University of Bath and was also fortunate enough to be selected as an athlete for the British Triathlon World Class Performance Programme. On this elite programme we were regularly tested in the laboratory to examine our exact level of fitness and to give us precise training levels at which to train. This approach was highly scientific and I loved being part of it. Knowing how you should train and seeing the improvements as a result of this testing was very motivating indeed. However, whilst very useful, such testing simply isn’t available to most age-group athletes around the world. The test procedures are lengthy, involve using a lot of expensive laboratory equipment and by taking lots of blood samples to monitor blood lactate they are quite invasive too. Fortunately there is an alternative way of assessing your swimming fitness that has all of the advantages of laboratory testing but with none of those downsides. The system is called Critical Swim Speed or CSS for short — here at Swim Smooth we are big fans of CSS training! Threshold is an extremely important point in all endurance sports because it is fundamental to your physiology — if you can improve your fitness so that your threshold (and so CSS) is at a faster speed then you will race quicker in any distance event — even in ultra-distance events such as Ironman and marathon swimming. Other fitness factors such as your outright strength or your

physiology — if you can improve your fitness so that your threshold (and so CSS) is at a faster speed then you will race quicker in any distance event — even in ultra-distance events such as Ironman and marathon swimming. Other fitness factors such as your outright strength or your ability to sprint play an extremely minor part in distance races in comparison. ADAM: If you remember back to the 11-year-old girl story in the introduction to this book, you will recall how quickly she could swim despite having very low levels of outright strength. Here we have one of the main reasons to explain that — she has excellent aerobic fitness from training very consistently in her swim club. i.e. her CSS pace is high. Always remember that distance swimming performances are not about strength but aerobic fitness — it’s about sustaining a good pace for a long time, not sprinting very quickly over a short distance. You need to develop this aerobic fitness in your swimming muscle groups to become a great distance swimmer and CSS training should play a major role in doing that. Improving your CSS is the key to improving your performance in any distance freestyle event. Training at this pace doesn’t have to be a chore — it’s actually quite good fun! --- Page 198 Text --- PAUL: If you have used a power meter on a bike and read Coggan and Allen’s excellent book ‘Training with Power’ (2006) you will be familiar with using the concept of Functional Threshold Power (FTP) to measure your threshold on the bike in Watts. CSS is the exact same concept but for swimming. In the controlled environment of a swimming pool we don’t need something as fancy as a power meter to measure threshold, it can be

using the concept of Functional Threshold Power (FTP) to measure your threshold on the bike in Watts. CSS is the exact same concept but for swimming. In the controlled environment of a swimming pool we don’t need something as fancy as a power meter to measure threshold, it can be defined as a pace per 100 m. As we shall see, rather than performing a 20-minute or 60-minute time trial to find FTP we perform two shorter swims in the pool and perform a calculation to find CSS pace. We recommend performing the CSS test approximately every four weeks to monitor fitness improvements. Once you know your CSS speed (say it is 1:40 / 100 m) you can then calculate your ideal training pace for endurance work (1:48 / 100 m) and for sprint training (1:35 / 100 m). Therefore as your fitness and CSS improves, your whole training plan adapts to keep pushing your fitness forwards. Combining CSS training with an outline skeleton structure (see Chapter 26) provides you with the perfect training routine that has the right mix of training levels, is flexible enough to handle life events and adapts to your fitness levels to keep pushing you forwards. In other words perfect training! Next we will take a look at the test you can use to find your current CSS pace and go on to show you some training sets you can use to improve that pace over time and so become a faster distance swimmer. The CSS Test Follow this procedure to conduct a CSS test: 1. Swim an easy warm-up of between 600 m and 1000 m, including a variety of technique drills and a few short efforts to lift your heart rate. 2. Perform a 400 m time trial from a push (not a

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
pace + 6—10 sec per 100 m. 20 km: CSS pace + 10—20 sec per 100 m (factoring in feed stops of 20—30 sec every 25 minutes or so). English Channel (38 km): CSS pace + 20—30 sec per 100 m (factoring in feed stops of 20—30 sec every 25 minutes or so). Of course you also need to train your endurance sufficiently to maintain these paces over the longer swims! Don’t I Need to Swim Faster than My CSS Pace to Improve it? You will have noticed that CSS training sets are swum at current CSS pace in order to become faster. For many swimmers this seems counter-intuitive, going against the commonly held belief that the key to becoming faster is to ‘train at a much faster pace and my body will get used to it’. Unfortunately this logic is flawed because the body does not work like that. When you train significantly faster than threshold you end up splitting the training effect into your anaerobic system too — which you don’t need to develop as a distance swimmer. You also give your body a much greater recovery task after the session, which means it has less energy left over to make the fitness adaptations you are looking for. The end result is that training significantly above CSS pace gives you less development of your threshold speed. Coaches Martin and Gabby explain the importance of correct pacing prior to a CSS set. --- Page 202 Text --- The research by MacLaren and Coulson [4] backs this up, demonstrating that threshold-paced training significantly develops CSS but much harder paced anaerobic sprint training often results in a slowing of CSS pace. Still not convinced? Compare this form of training to weight training. Say you wanted to increase your maximum bench press.

### Swim Smooth_full_text.txt
include some anaerobic work and short sprints in your training — they’re good for your swimming technique in themselves: they give you a ‘feel for the water’ at higher speeds and they train your nervous system to recognise the higher forces associated with producing greater power output. Sprint races can also be a lot of fun between friends and should not be discounted because they are not specific to distance swimming. What we are suggesting is that you shift your key training sets away from anaerobic sprint sessions to CSS work if you are focusing on events over 400 m. In practice this means slowing the pace a touch and shortening the recoveries — making the speed more sustained. Pacing Your CSS Sets Correctly Think of your CSS pace as a single reference point from which all your other training paces are calculated. In the training sets in Appendix C we use this principle, giving you a target pace for different sets in reference to your CSS pace. For example a simple endurance set for a swimmer with a CSS of 1:40 / 100 m is: 1000 m at CSS pace + 10s per 100 m, i.e. 1:50 / 100 m 800 m at CSS pace + 8s per 100 m, i.e. 1:48 / 100 m 600 m at CSS pace + 6s per 100 m, i.e. 1:46 / 100 m 400 m at CSS pace + 4s per 100 m, i.e. 1:44 / 100 m --- Page 203 Text --- 200 m at CSS pace + 2s per 100 m, i.e. 1:42 / 100 m PAUL: Using one of these devices in this manner is quite an experience, it is like swimming against the red World Record line that follows swimmers up and down the pool at the Olympics.

absolutely essential. Besides the necessity to train at a pace appropriate to your race distance, the biggest skill you will develop is the ability to control and manage your effort over time. In the heat of a squad session, pacing can go straight out of the window as swimmers try frantically to keep up with the person in front of them. In our Perth Swim Smooth squad sessions, the leader of each lane is instructed to use a beeper under their swim cap set at the right target pace for the lane, all the other swimmers in the lane have to do is set off five seconds behind the swimmer in front and maintain that gap. This takes the pressure out of these types of sessions and encourages the lane to work together as a team, each happy to take their turn at the front with the beeper. Whilst it sounds simple to maintain a given swimming pace, in practice all sorts of things can affect how well you develop this skill, not least your competitive urge and the notion that a training session should feel hard from the very first lap for you to maximise the benefit from it. Instead of this, think of a CSS session as part training, part technique — the technique being your ability to pace things out well. The two go hand in hand: by sticking to your goal pace accurately you will maximise the training effect of your session. ADAM: Did you know that over 90% of all endurance world records for running (track) and swimming (pool) have been achieved through perfectly even pacing or with a ‘negative split’ — i.e. finishing faster than you started?

that over 90% of all endurance world records for running (track) and swimming (pool) have been achieved through perfectly even pacing or with a ‘negative split’ — i.e. finishing faster than you started? Pace judgement is an absolutely essential skill for great distance swimming and with CSS training you will really start to develop yours. Watches such as the Finis SwimSense, the Garmin 310XT (and the newer 910XT) and the Swimovate Pro can help you monitor your pacing consistency. You will need a GPS device such as the Garmin to monitor pace in open water. In the future we expect this technology to keep evolving becoming ever more accurate and cheaper too. --- Page 206 Text --- Developing Pace Awareness in the Open Water In the pool you can easily monitor your swimming pace and your strokes per length to assess your consistency but in open water neither of these variables is easily measured. Elite open water swimmers do monitor one metric though to ensure some consistency and that is stroke rate — how many strokes they take per minute. Normally this information is fed to the swimmer from a coach on a support boat and in general the target is to avoid stroke rate dropping by more than 10% over the course of a race. Every swimmer has their own unique stroke rate that they can sustain. As an extreme example of how consistent an elite swimmer can be, Shelley Taylor-Smith (seven-time World Marathon Swimming Champion) held 88 SPM (strokes per minute) for a distance of 70 km from Sydney to Wollongong (Australia) only varying by ±5% over this epic 12-hour challenge. Amazing! Probably the biggest single difference between an amateur and a professional endurance athlete is their ability to feel exactly what level of perceived exertion they are

(strokes per minute) for a distance of 70 km from Sydney to Wollongong (Australia) only varying by ±5% over this epic 12-hour challenge. Amazing! Probably the biggest single difference between an amateur and a professional endurance athlete is their ability to feel exactly what level of perceived exertion they are holding for a set distance. Every single session they do, elite swimmers are tuning themselves into what it feels like to hold a certain pace over a specific distance. ADAM: Grant Hackett is reputed to have been able to hold multiple 100 m intervals in the pool all within 0.4 seconds of each other without using a pace clock — an amazing feat when you consider that most amateur swimmers will vary by 2 to 12 seconds over a similar set with the assistance of a pace clock! With good training preparation you too can tap into this deeper understanding of what perceived exertion and pace you can truly maintain over a given distance. You won’t always get this right but when you do get it wrong you should try to learn as much as possible so that you can improve your pacing ability in the future. It is very difficult to accurately judge what pace you can hold for an open water event given all the external factors that are out of your control such as waves, chop and currents. Sometimes giving yourself a very strict target pace can be psychologically detrimental, especially if you are dropping off this pace for reasons out of your control. By getting to know your body better and knowing exactly what level of fitness you have in the pool at any point in time, you can improve your ability to judge the right pace whatever the external influences. The key to good pacing

One of the most frequently asked questions at the end of our full-day Swim Smooth Clinics is ‘do you recommend gym training for swimmers and triathletes?’ Our answer is that it depends, mostly on whether you have enough time available in your week. In an ideal world we would all be full-time athletes with access to well-equipped gyms and physiotherapy, pilates and even yoga classes. In this situation you would definitely benefit from such conditioning work to help you become a more balanced athlete but in reality most of us are time-strapped and the danger of introducing significant conditioning work

be full-time athletes with access to well-equipped gyms and physiotherapy, pilates and even yoga classes. In this situation you would definitely benefit from such conditioning work to help you become a more balanced athlete but in reality most of us are time-strapped and the danger of introducing significant conditioning work to your programme is that you would have to cut back on the swimming itself to fit it in. With this in mind we have designed a flexibility and conditioning routine that you can complete quickly and efficiently both before and after swim training or even in front of the TV! What is Dry-Land Training? Dry-land training can be loosely categorised into three main areas: 1. Flexibility and mobility. 2. Core stability and rehabilitation. 3. Strength training. PAUL: Dry-land training derived its name from the fact that many of the world’s elite swim programmes would engage their swimmers in conditioning exercises on the pool deck immediately before and after training in the water. Australian swimming legend Ian Thorpe was famous for arriving at training 30 minutes prior to every session to work on his mobility and flexibility. This extra conditioning work has often been cited as one of the reasons why he was so successful in winning multiple Olympic Gold Medals. Whilst we will probably never reach the same levels of flexibility and conditioning that elite swimmers have, making improvements in important areas can help you make large improvements to your stroke technique. 1. Flexibility and Mobility --- Page 210 Text --- When it comes to swimming, a big limiting factor for many triathletes is a lack of flexibility. Poor flexibility can give rise to many stroke technique flaws including crossovers, dropped elbows and sinking legs, all of which will severely limit your potential in the water. Swim, bike and

little and often is best. Calf stretch (right). Crouch down with foot kept flat on the floor and the other pointing back underneath you. Keep your body weight over the foot which is flat on the ground and feel the stretch through the lower calf muscle (soleus). 2. Core Stability and Rehabilitation In Chapter 10 we looked at how you could improve your use of your upper core (shoulders / upper back) and lower core (lower back / abdominal) muscle groups to improve your posture whilst swimming. Here are a few key exercises that you can use at home or in the gym to improve your general conditioning in these areas. Given that core stabilisation training initially requires some skill in order for you to feel the correct muscles activating, we would highly recommend seeking the assistance of a personal trainer or physiotherapist to take you through these exercises. Core stability became very popular in the mid to late 1990s together with an increasing interest in pilates, yoga and the combined ‘yogilates’. Core stability is the interaction of coordination and strength of the abdominal, back and glute muscles during activity to ensure that the spine is stabilised and provides a firm base to support both basic and powerful everyday movements of the arms and legs. Core stability training is an essential component of sport performance and plays a key role in injury prevention. The core muscles are the deepest layer of muscles within the torso and include the abdominals, lower back, buttock and hip muscles, which surround --- Page 215 Text --- the pelvis. Developing a solid foundation within your torso will then allow you to generate powerful movements from your trunk outwards. In a nutshell, core stability: Improves posture. Maintains healthy and balanced muscles. Enhances physical functioning in everyday

back, buttock and hip muscles, which surround --- Page 215 Text --- the pelvis. Developing a solid foundation within your torso will then allow you to generate powerful movements from your trunk outwards. In a nutshell, core stability: Improves posture. Maintains healthy and balanced muscles. Enhances physical functioning in everyday activities (‘Functional Fitness’). Facilitates powerful movements such as those executed during sport. Helps to protect joints and muscles from injury. Neutral Spine The idea of a neutral spine relates to setting your trunk before you begin a core stability programme. By finding your neutral spine position you are activating the key core muscles within your torso, which need to be ‘turned on’ prior to executing coordinated movements. Here’s how: 1. Start by lying flat on your back on a mat or comfortable carpeted floor with your knees bent. 2. Place your arms by your sides so that your elbows are straight and your shoulders relaxed. 3. Slowly take three deep breaths in and out to try and release any stress and relax your body. 4. Gently and slowly tilt your pelvis so that you are flattening your back into the floor. Avoid lifting your buttocks. Try to isolate the movement so that only your pelvis is moving. 5. Now tilt your pelvis in the opposite direction so that you are arching your lower back. Again try to keep the movement isolated to your pelvis. 6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 a few more times. By tilting your pelvis you are performing what is called an anterior pelvic tilt (arch back) and a posterior pelvic tilt (flatten back). 7. Now to locate your neutral spine, find the middle position between flattening and arching your back. Here are four simple exercises that you can use to improve your core conditioning: Controlled Roll

performing what is called an anterior pelvic tilt (arch back) and a posterior pelvic tilt (flatten back). 7. Now to locate your neutral spine, find the middle position between flattening and arching your back. Here are four simple exercises that you can use to improve your core conditioning: Controlled Roll Ups Lie flat on your back on the floor, legs straight out in front of you placing your arms and hands by your sides. Gently and slowly lift your head off the floor and draw your lower stomach to spine as you slowly start to sit up. Slowly breathe in as you continue sitting up until you are straight, then pause. Begin rolling back down whilst breathing out. Start at your pelvis and slowly unfold your spine as you return to the starting position. Repeat 10—15 times. --- Page 216 Text --- Bridging Lie flat on your back, find your neutral spine and draw your lower stomach in. Slowly push down through your feet and lift your bottom right up so that your trunk is straight with your shoulders, hips and knees in a line. Breathe in as you lift and out as you lower, and hold the lift for 5—10 seconds thinking of squeezing your buttocks as you lift. Repeat 10—15 times. Wall Squats Standing with your back to the wall take one step away with both feet whilst keeping your back to the wall. Your toes should be in line and slightly turned out. Find your neutral spine position and draw your lower stomach in. Holding this position, slowly perform a half squat keeping your bottom against the wall. Hold the squat for five seconds and then lift to return to the start. Complete three sets of twelve squats. --- Page 217 Text --- Front Plank Place your

position and draw your lower stomach in. Holding this position, slowly perform a half squat keeping your bottom against the wall. Hold the squat for five seconds and then lift to return to the start. Complete three sets of twelve squats. --- Page 217 Text --- Front Plank Place your elbows on the floor shoulder width apart and directly under your shoulders. Supporting yourself on your elbows and toes, be sure your body is in a flat line with no dip or arch in your spine and with your bottom tucked in. Keep your spine neutral and draw in your lower stomach. Hold this position for 20—30 seconds and then rest for 30 seconds, repeating three times. As you get stronger challenge yourself by trying to hold the position for longer each time. The Y-T-W-L Here’s a dry-land exercise we have borrowed from physiotherapists to help you tune into drawing your shoulders together and back (technical term ‘scapular retraction’). We are sure you are familiar with the Village People’s hit song from the 1970s: ‘YMCA’. We are going to do the Y-T-W-L instead! --- Page 218 Text --- Standing in some space, draw your arms up into a Y position beside you. How do they naturally sit? Do they tend to lean forwards like Paul’s position on the left? Maintaining this position, focus on drawing your shoulder blades together and back and notice how your arms come back in line with the body. That’s good posture in action! Avoid arching your lower back as you do this. Run through each of the Y-T-W-L positions, holding each position for around ten seconds; the exercise gets progressively harder to stabilise through the four positions! The YTWL is a great exercise to add into any stretching and conditioning routine that you have in

your lower back as you do this. Run through each of the Y-T-W-L positions, holding each position for around ten seconds; the exercise gets progressively harder to stabilise through the four positions! The YTWL is a great exercise to add into any stretching and conditioning routine that you have in place. You can practise it immediately before a swim or even between sets in the shallow end of the pool. Over time the YTWL will give you a greater awareness of your posture and help you improve it. In Chapter 30 we will look at some more functional rehab-style exercises for the upper back and shoulders that will help to ward off shoulder injury. --- Page 219 Text --- 3. Strength Training in the Gym When considering introducing traditional gym strengthening exercises into your swimming programme we would encourage you to always ask the question ‘how specific is this exercise to my swimming?’. Swimming is not ordinarily limited by strength in the true sense of the word, which is probably best demonstrated by the example of the 11-year-old girl who so easily cruises past you in the pool and yet would never come close to matching your strength in the gym as an adult. Despite swimming not being limited by strength, some swimmers and triathletes like to add a gym strengthening programme to their routine during the winter months and we would not discourage you from doing so if you are seeking a little general conditioning and toning. We would, however, encourage you to avoid too much emphasis on lifting heavy weights, especially those focused on the muscles at the front of the shoulder and chest (e.g. shoulder and bench press). If performed excessively these exercises can limit mobility in the shoulders and also bring you into a rounded-shoulder posture

however, encourage you to avoid too much emphasis on lifting heavy weights, especially those focused on the muscles at the front of the shoulder and chest (e.g. shoulder and bench press). If performed excessively these exercises can limit mobility in the shoulders and also bring you into a rounded-shoulder posture that could harm your alignment in the pool. In fact, most swimmers and triathletes that we see who have a background in weight training are limited by those two factors: posture and mobility. If you are going to use the gym we suggest you focus your attention on the following exercises that will help maintain and improve your swimming posture: Barbell Row. This exercise focuses on the shoulder and scapular region muscle groups. Use a light weight for this exercise and keep the shoulder horizontal, aiming for 2—3 sets of 12—15 reps with each arm. Lat Pull Down. A great exercise for assisting with good posture and alignment of the upper back. Keep your spine straight when performing this exercise and keep the weight light. Aim for 2-3 sets of 15—20 reps. --- Page 220 Text --- Seated Upright Row. Another excellent exercise for helping you to focus on drawing your shoulder blades together and down when you swim. Keep the spine straight and again use a light weight. Aim for 2—3 sets of 15—20 reps. Travelling Away from Home?

Epub 2006 May 6. --- Page 222 Text --- CHAPTER 30 Prevention and Management of Shoulder Injuries Shoulder pain and injury is very common amongst freestyle swimmers and is caused by repetitive stress placed on the shoulders during each arm stroke. At least 80% of adult swimmers will experience some form of shoulder pain in their swimming lives and such pain should be taken very seriously so that it does not lead to a full-blown injury and time out from swimming. Most elite swimmers train for around 40-70 km per week, which adds up to well over two million strokes per year — that is an awful lot of potential stress on their shoulders. In fact, in elite swimming circles shoulder injury was so common that it used to be considered a fact of swimming life, just something they had to live with. Fortunately these days we understand that the stress on the shoulders is dramatically affected by stroke technique and that by correcting your technique we can greatly reduce stress on the joint, quickly reduce symptoms and go on to cure the condition. An absolutely vital aspect of your preparation as a swimmer is consistency

seen by ultrasound examination. Take Immediate Action --- Page 224 Text --- As soon as you experience any shoulder pain or injury always seek medical advice from a physiotherapist, athletic therapist or sports doctor as soon as possible in order to determine the severity of the injury and to begin rehabilitation. Also immediately reduce or stop training to prevent the pain and swelling from continuing. Resting from activities or movements which aggravate pain is critical and applying ice to reduce inflammation is also key to a successful and fast recovery. Secondly, make sure that you address areas of your stroke technique that can be causing or aggravating the injury using the advice that follows in this chapter. Whilst rehabilitation is important, without addressing your stroke technique an injury could quickly return. Finally, as part of your rehabilitation, introduce the strengthening and stability exercises into your training programme so as to maintain muscle balance around your shoulder joint, which will help to maintain healthy strong shoulders and upper back. Before training always warm-up and stretch lightly but do not over-stretch your shoulders as too much flexibility can also be detrimental. What is the Cause of Shoulder Pain? Shoulder pain is commonly classified into three categories: 1. Shoulder Joint Impingement Shoulder Impingement is a compression or squashing of the structures within the top of the shoulder joint (subacromial space). Within this space lie muscular tendons (e.g. the rotator cuff), and the fluid filled sac that prevents muscle on bone traction (the subacromial bursa). Impingement arises due to the thickening or swelling of the structures within the space or upward migration of the ball in the shoulder joint, caused by having poor posture or poor biomechanics while swimming. 2. Overuse Injury Overuse injuries are generally defined as tendonopathies, which is where there is

bursa). Impingement arises due to the thickening or swelling of the structures within the space or upward migration of the ball in the shoulder joint, caused by having poor posture or poor biomechanics while swimming. 2. Overuse Injury Overuse injuries are generally defined as tendonopathies, which is where there is injury to or degeneration of the tendon of a muscle, which may or may not be accompanied by inflammation. Damage to a tendon tissue occurs when the load applied exceeds the strength of the tendon either over time or in a single incident. Tendon injuries can be very difficult to treat because tendons have a poor blood supply and totally resting a tendon to allow it to heal is hard to achieve in daily life. FIGURE 30.19 The shoulder joint showing all the structures of the rotator cuff which may become thickened or swollen from poor posture and biomechanics when swimming which can lead to impingement. (Source: Principles of Anatomy and Physiology 13th edition, Gerard J. Tortora, p. 311). --- Page 225 Text --- 3. Joint Laxity/Instability Joint laxity or instability normally develops over an extended period of time if there is no traumatic injury to the shoulder joint. Gradual deterioration in the ligaments and inhibition of the rotator cuff muscles leads to laxity or loosening of the shoulder joint. If this is not addressed instability of the shoulder can occur which may lead to a tear in the lining of the socket of the shoulder joint (a capsular lesion). Elements of each of these three patterns can coexist and are often interrelated. For example, a swimmer who has been diagnosed with a rotator cuff injury will experience pain, which prevents the muscles from working properly thereby allowing the ball (head of the humerus) to move more in the socket.

inspired (as we hope you will be!) with the large variety of training sets in Appendix C. Other aspects to watch out for are adding too much pull buoy, paddles and bands work to your swimming sessions, especially if you have poor catch mechanics and limited body rotation in your stroke. Shoulder Injury: Posture, Mobility and Muscular Imbalance In freestyle swimmers, there are particular muscle groups which tend to be strong and tight (internal rotators — pectorals and latissimus dorsi) and ones which are weak and lengthened (external rotators and middle and lower trapezius muscles). These imbalances lead to altered biomechanics and so a predisposition to injury. An essential path to reducing the abnormal imbalances in your shoulders is to include a cross --- Page 230 Text --- training programme in your exercise regime. Strengthening the less dominant muscles used in swimming and maintaining good flexibility in your shoulder and thoracic spine will greatly reduce the likelihood of shoulder pain and injury. Follow the six specific exercises below to reduce the stress on your shoulders. Maintaining Thoracic Spine Flexibility A slumped posture is becoming more and more prevalent in the average population as so many of us now have desk jobs and spend large parts of our day sitting at computers. With our shoulders slumped forward and our chins poking out, our upper back and thoracic spine begin to morph into a hump back, which in physio terms is referred to as a kyphosis. In swimmers, a mild kyphosis is common due to the nature of the freestyle stroke and the overuse of the muscles at the front of our shoulders pulling us into a rounded shoulder position. This kyphosis can lead to a loss of flexibility in the thoracic spine which in turn can result in excessive flexibility in

aim to hold the position for 1-2 minutes until it becomes comfortable, then aim to hold it for longer periods during the day. FIGURE 30.23 Develop an improved posture using Scapular Setting. Do not overexaggerate the position and arch the lower back (right). --- Page 233 Text --- Repeat this exercise frequently throughout the day in sitting and standing positions. As a progression try the same position lying on your front with your arms at your side, this will allow you to train these muscles in a prone posture similar to swimming. 4. Shoulder Shrugs Shoulder shrugs address weakness in the upper trapezius muscle, which is often seen when the shoulder on one side is depressed or sits lower, this is normally the shoulder experiencing shoulder pain. Start by standing with your arm slightly away from your body, elbow straight and your palm facing forward (1). Set your shoulder as in the previous Scapular Setting exercise and hold this position. Gently shrug your shoulder toward your ear, hold for 1- 2 seconds (2) before lowering. Repeat three sets of the exercise, each with 10-12 repetitions. As a progression you can add a light hand weight if control allows (3 and 4). Start with 1 kg and progress to 3 kg. FIGURE 30.24 Shoulder Shrugs with and without weights. --- Page 234 Text --- 5. Seated Row Using Theraband A seated row aims to strengthen the muscles at the back of the shoulder between the shoulder blades, which help to stabilise the scapula and improve overall shoulder position and biomechanics.

the scapula and improve overall shoulder position and biomechanics. Use a piece of theraband anchored to a door knob or railing at belly button height, stand or sit holding one end of the band in each hand with it taut and slightly stretched in front of you. Start with your elbows straight and shoulders slightly rounded (1 and 3). Leading with your elbows pull your hands toward you bringing them toward the outside of your chest (2). As you pull the band to your chest gently pull your shoulder blades together (4). Repeat three sets of 10-12 repetitions each. As a progression increase repetitions to 15-20 and then increase the resistance by using a stronger theraband. --- Page 235 Text --- FIGURE 30.25 Seated Row Using Theraband. 6. External Shoulder Rotation with Theraband This external shoulder rotation exercise focuses on improving strength in the back of the shoulder primarily in the rotator cuff muscles. This exercise helps to re-balance the rotator cuff muscles and improve the position of the humeral head (ball) in the glenoid fossa (socket). Anchor one end of a piece of theraband to a door knob and stand with your unaffected shoulder beside the door. Hold the end of the theraband on your affected side and stand so that the band is taut with your elbow bent to 90° and your upper arm along your side. Your wrist should be level with the door knob. Set your shoulder as in Exercises 2 and 3 and then gently pull the band away from your mid-line pivoting at your elbow. Repeat three sets of 10-12 repetitions of this exercise. As a progression increase to 15-20 repetitions then increase the resistance by using a stronger theraband. FIGURE 30.26 External Shoulder Rotation Using Theraband. --- Page 237 Text --- CHAPTER 31

If you’re going to use an oil based lubricant, make sure that you take the time to clean it off properly after your race as it can degrade the material and shorten the life of the suit. ADAM: Don’t fight against the suit, work with it. Try altering your arm recovery over the top of the water to a straighter arm style as we did with Kate, this will avoid tension and premature fatigue in the deltoids. If your arms and shoulders become tired when swimming in a suit are you trying to swim with a classic high- elbow recovery? The solution to this problem isn’t to get in the gym and build up your strength as the extra muscle bulk may actually make the problem worse. Instead, work on a relaxed but straighter arm recovery style. As a bonus this will help give you greater arm clearance over the surface in rougher conditions. Open your elbow angle out in a wetsuit to create a straighter arm recovery, thereby avoiding wetsuit fatigue. PAUL: In some open water swimming and warm water triathlon events around the world ‘swim skins’ like the Blue Seventy Point Zero Three (TX) are still allowed. These suits are like a very thin wetsuit which provide marginal buoyancy benefits, warmth, sun protection and also enhance proprioceptive control through the core abdominal region. The surface of the suit is also aqua-phobic meaning that you slide through the water very easily. We have tested them extensively in the warm waters here in Perth and have found them to be amazingly quick. If your budget will stretch to one we’d highly recommend them for warm water swims. --- Page 275 Text --- CHAPTER 39 Adapting Your Stroke to a Variety of Conditions PAUL: In February 2011 I took a group

of this book. If you have a strong sprint background, this type of threshold-based training at CSS pace (Critical Swim Speed) when combined with a lap interval beeper like the Wetronome or Finis Tempo Trainer Pro can really add an exciting and motivating element to your sessions, especially if you find it hard to find anyone to swim with who can push you along at your pace. Set yourself some challenging targets for a set of 200 m intervals for example (e.g. 2:24 / 200 m) and dial in the Wetronome to beep every 18 seconds. Simply aim to be at each 25 m marker each time the beep goes and without realising it you will be half way through a really rewarding hard-fitness set trying to make sure that the little beeper does not get ahead of you! This adds in an element of pace awareness and is very much a technique set in itself – can you survive the entire set holding good form without blowing up? The format for these types of sessions is only limited by your imagination and we have included some of our favourites for you in Appendix C. ∗These distances are our best recommendations for completing this exercise in a 50 m pool – if you are swimming in a 25 m or 25 yd pool, try halving the suggested distances or ensure that your turn is quick and does not disrupt your focus on your catch. --- Page 333 Text --- APPENDIX C Training Sessions About These Training Sessions To create a training session, pick from the training sets in this guide.

friendly observer to duplicate them yourself. 3. Study the common errors that coaches look for so that you can avoid them! 4. When reading about and executing the drills, keep in mind that they are often designed as “overcorrections” for a specific technique flaw. Drills are intended to help you create a new pattern of movement. After completing each drill, remember to score your success. 5. At the end of each step, review the key points in the Success Summary to make sure that you understand the material. Then total your scores from the drills in that step and make sure that you’ve achieved the needed level of success before moving on to the next step. As you make your way through the steps, you will begin to appreciate that swim- ming is not so much about brute strength as it is about the timing and rhythm of your movements. Getting it right takes a lot of thoughtful practice, and you will benefit from revisiting the steps when you have trouble with a particular skill or technique. ix --- Page 11 Text --- Climbing the Steps to Swimming Success Swimming is a journey, and this book is designed to help you work through that journey one step at a time. Each step is laid out with a focus on a certain skills or techniques and ways to increase or decrease the difficulty.

butterfly. Modern rules dictate the specifics of format, but the essential structure of each race is the same: a start, a swim, and a finish. The AquATiC environmenT Swimming differs from other sports in several ways. For one thing, swimming is not necessarily a natural activity for human beings. Indeed, humans bear little resem- blance to species that are geared to operate in an aquatic environment; for example, fish don’t have necks. As a result, in order to swim, we humans must make some adaptations—in part to accommodate our differences but also to take advantage of them. For success in swimming, you must first become comfortable in the aquatic envi- ronment, which differs dramatically from the land-based environment in which we typically operate on a daily basis. It is easier to do so if you understand the key dif- ferences between humans and aquatic creatures. First, as mostly terrestrial creatures, we walk upright, and our natural position for most of our waking hours is basically vertical. In the water, however, most of what we do involves being horizontal, and this difference takes some getting used to for most people. In addition, in many sports, success depends largely on strength and speed. In swimming, however, there is nothing solid to push against; therefore, though strength does matter in swimming, it is much more important to apply pressure to the water in the correct way. Because water is a fluid, it moves around you rather xi --- Page 13 Text --- The Sport of Swimming than resolutely resisting you in the way that a solid does. Similarly, speed in swim- ming comes not necessarily from moving your body parts faster but from using your movements to put pressure on the water in an effective manner. As anyone who has participated in water

buoys, and snorkels. Kickboards The kickboard (figure 2) is a fairly common piece of equipment found in many swim- mers’ training bags. It is typically made of some sort of foam to provide flotation. Its purpose is to provide a buoyancy assist so that swimmers can isolate and train the kicking motion. It is often used to train all four competitive strokes. Figure 2 Two different styles of kickboards. xv --- Page 17 Text --- The Sport of Swimming Fins Fins are commonly used in swim training to add resistance to the kicking motion, helping the person to swim more easily or to make the workout harder. They come in a variety of shapes and sizes (figure 3), and some are designed specifically for a cer- tain competitive stroke—for example, the monofin and the breaststroke fin. Monof- ins are a training tool specific to dolphin kick. Breastroke fins are also very specific to that kick and, due to the increase in pressure on the groin area and the inside of the knee, should probably be used only under the supervision of a knowledgeable coach and with a swimmer who has had sufficient technique training and the strength to benefit from the extra resistance. For training purposes, fins with medium-size blades work for most swimmers, though it is a good idea to use shorter blades in the beginning in order to prevent injury. People who have less strength or flexibility in the lower extremities—especially the ankles—should definitely use a medium or shorter blade of 6 to 9 inches (about 15 to 23 centimeters) to prevent overstressing those joints with the added pressure and resistance created by longer blades (often seen in scuba shops). In addition, short-blade fins (shorter than 6 inches, or 15 cen- timeters) are often used to work with

ever, not to become dependent on that equipment for being able to move through the water with skill and ease. In addition, your success depends on doing the drills and using the equipment correctly rather than quickly. As with any learning, some swim- mers progress faster than others, and each skill presents new a challenge. Therefore, prepare yourself to be patient—swimming is a learned process that takes some time. Swimming is one of the best sports in which to participate from a very young age to a very old age. Some competitions even offer a 95-and-over age group! Athletes can participate in this sport for such a long time—and at such advanced ages—because of its low- to no-impact nature and the fact that it enables one to focus on technique and effective movement. Science tells us that at a certain point in life we stop getting stronger and gaining endurance; however, even though you may not be able to get faster after a certain point, swimming always gives you a chance to get better. Let’s move on now to the steps to swimming success, which enable you to learn and practice skills that provide a solid foundation for lifelong enjoyment! xviii --- Page 20 Text --- Step 1 Floating The goal of this first step is to move from a vertical position to the horizontal neutral position that serves as the platform for swimming in all four competitive strokes. This step also helps you become comfortable in the water. By the end of this step, you should be able to • transition from vertical to floating on your back, • transition from vertical to floating on your front, • balance on your center of buoyancy in a streamlined position on your back, and • balance on your center of buoyancy

catch phase (figure 2.2), in which the key surface (whether in the form of one hand or both hands) enters the water and begins to get perpendic- ular to the direction in which you are going. For a mental representation of the catch phase, swimmers think about anchoring the hand in the water, which hinges on three factors. The first factor involves water movement. Turbulent water (as in a washing machine) makes it hard to establish an anchor since the water is already moving. To minimize this problem, find water that is not disturbed in front of you and stretch to reach it. The second factor involves the pitch or angle of the hand(s). Recall that it is almost always best to put pressure on the water in a direction perpendicular to your direction of travel. As a general rule, your fingers should almost always be pointed slightly down on each stroke in order to encourage at least your hand to be perpendicular to your direction of travel. The last factor is strength. If you do not yet have the strength to hold the water, your hand will waffle through it. Alternatively, being unable to hold the water may relate to bad balance, which can weaken the propulsive force enough that it does not overcome the drag force. Both of these issues can be corrected over time through practice. 24 --- Page 44 Text --- Manipulating the Water Figure 2.2 Basic caTch Preparation 1. Make sure you have a suitable space to perform the skill. 2. You can use a kickboard or pull buoy for the skill. Execution 1.

is clear, and there is at least 25 yards of space to perform the skill. 2. Push off the wall and steam- line. Execution 1. Begin swimming freestyle. 2. As you swim, pay special attention to where your upper a arm is in relation to the water. 3. The closer to vertical the upper arm is, the better the rotation in the upper torso is. 4. Let the hips rotate with the shoulder as one piece. b c 59 --- Page 79 Text --- Swimming: Steps to Success Drills FOr rOTaTiOn Rotation through the core has been the subject of much recent debate in competitive swimming. Some competitors swim flatter, with little rotation, whereas others swim through the hips with considerable rotation. Both approaches can be correct, depend- ing on the swimmer, but the most sustainable recreational swimming allows for most people to use the core to aid in rotation rather than relying on spinal flexibility. Some swimmers have more flexibility and strength in the spine and torso, allowing them to twist easier. Rotation Drill 1 Tap your head This drill gives you feedback about where your hands are in relation to the centerline of your body and your axis of rotation, as well as the vertical position of your head. It also compels you to rotate your body to perform the drill correctly. With all that said, the drill itself is very simple. Gently touch your fingertips to the crown of your head on the recovery, then place your hand in the water to recover for the next catch and pull. As in the catch-up drill, wait until one hand has completely recovered before beginning the next catch. TO increase DiFFicUlTy • Perform six kicks per stroke.

your sides for balance. Draw your heels up. Once your heels are close to your hips, rotate your heels out wider than your knees and then sweep your heels together. Your lower legs and feet should be dorsiflexed or in an L position. Squeeze your ankles together and point your toes while finishing the kick. Remember that these motions are more about pressure than about speed or strength. Once you complete one kick, return to the neutral position and let your momentum fade. Repeat the same motion until you are comfortable with it. Important note! You will not be able to see where you are going during this drill. Make sure that the backstroke flags in place—five yards from the wall—or have your coach or instructor stop you when necessary! 102 --- Page 122 Text --- Breaststroke TToo iinnccrreeaassee DDiiffffiiccuullTTyy •• PPllaaccee aa kkiicckkbbooaarrdd aaccrroossss tthhee uuppppeerr ppaarrtt ooff yyoouurr lleeggss ttoo pprreevveenntt yyoouurr uuppppeerr lleeggss ffrroomm ccoommiinngg oouutt ooff tthhee wwaatteerr.. •• PPllaaccee aa ppuullll bbuuooyy bbeettwweeeenn yyoouurr lleeggss,, sslliigghhttllyy aabboovvee yyoouurr mmiidd--tthhiigghhss,, ttoo eennssuurree tthhaatt yyoouurr kknneeeess ssttaayy ttooggeetthheerr..

It was developed in the 1930s as a way to minimize the drag caused by underwater recovery of the arms in the breaststroke. Early variants of the butterfly (referred to as the butterfly breaststroke) used an over-the-water recovery with a breaststroke kick. This technique was much faster than the breaststroke but required a great deal of strength. It was not until the 1950s that the butterfly was con- sidered a separate stroke from breaststroke, and the use of a dolphin kick was added to the official competition rules governing the new stroke. As mentioned in step 5, the butterfly, like the breaststroke, is considered a “short- axis” stroke but is really a timing-and-rhythm stroke. It does involve rotating on a shorter axis (i.e., through the chest, laterally) rather than on a long axis (down the spine), but the most important elements to keep in mind with this stroke are common to all of the strokes: • Good body position • Effective catch • Pressure on the water throughout the stroke • Acceleration throughout the stroke •

in which waves and swells can be problematic; however, it is also true for smaller bodies of water, in which even a light chop of small waves can create an issue. Swells and chop are often caused by wind, but they can also be produced by other factors, such as upwellings and tidal changes. Another—and often neglected—aspect of surface conditions involves traffic. It is not recommended that you swim in an area of high boat traffic; interactions between watercraft and swimmers usually end poorly for the swimmer. There may also be surface debris, such as sticks, logs, and trash. An open-water swim plan must also take account of currents and of the geog- raphy—both of the bottom of the body of water and of the immediate shoreline. A swimmer can be carried offshore by a rip current or downstream by river flow, and either situation is dangerous. Therefore, it is crucial to know about any currents or tides, including their strength and direction of flow. As for geography, consider all possible factors. For example, is there a shallow entry or a drop-off? How deep is the water? Is the shore sandy or rocky? Is there any vegetation? In addition, when swimming in a body of water other than a pool (and sometimes even in a pool!), you will encounter some form of biological life. It could be as simple as bacteria, moss, or algae or as complex and intimidating as fish, jellyfish, reptiles, or mammals. This caveat is not meant to discourage you from enjoying a swim in the open water but to stress the importance of knowing what you are getting into. Check with local officials to make sure that your intended swimming location is free from harmful bacteria and other potentially dangerous life forms. Consider also the fact
